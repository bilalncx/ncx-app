                <h2>Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing <span>and Know Your Customer Policy</span></h2>

                <p>The purposes of the NCX’s Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and Know Your Customer Policy (hereinafter — the “AML/CTF and KYC Policy“) is to identify, prevent and mitigate possible risks of NCX being involved in illegal activity. “NCX” refers to NCX Digital Exchange LLC, a company duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Company Reg. Number - 2477 LLC 2022, with the registered Address - Suite 305, Griffith Corporate Centre, Beachmont, Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>

                <p>To confirm with international and local regulations, NCX has implemented effective internal procedures to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, corruption and bribery and to react correspondingly in case of any form of suspicious activity from its Users.</p>
                
                <p>Money Laundering can be defined as: ‘the conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from criminal activity, or from an act of participation in such activity, for the purposes of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property, or assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such activity to evade the legal consequences of his action.’</p>
                
                <p>Terrorist Financing can be defined as: ‘the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of funds with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts.’</p>
                
                <p>To combat anti-money laundering (AML) around the globe, a growing number of increasingly onerous laws and regulations have been enacted. While AML laws and regulations vary by country and region, they often share similarities, including the need to create policies and procedures, as well as invest in technology, in an effort to combat all forms of financial crime.</p>
                
                <h3>How is AML regulated in different jurisdictions?</h3>
                
                <p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body that sets standards to help countries develop and update their laws to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, is responsible for global AML guidance. The FATF includes 39 members, 37 member jurisdictions as well as the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Consequently, many of the laws and regulations around the world include commonalities as promoted by the FATF to its members.</p>
                
                <h3>Regulations in Europe</h3>
                
                <p>European regulation of AML is guided by a series of legislative directives. The EU released the Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, (6AMLD), which was in force on 02 December 2018, and required member states to transpose to national law by 03 December 2020.</p>
                
                <p>In the UK firms must adhere to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs), and be aware of the guidance set down by the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) which provides guidelines within the United Kingdom on how firms should conduct Due Diligence on their customers.</p>  
                
                <p>Other legislation in relation to AML/CTF are:</p>

                <p>To help fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the Law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person or entity who opens an Account. We are required by Law to ask you to provide your name, address, date of birth and other information about you, your organisation or persons related to your organisation that will allow us to identify you before we approve your Account. We also may ask you to provide certain identifying documents, such as your driver’s license or passport or your organisation’s articles of incorporation and may obtain credit and other consumer reports to assist us in verifying your identity and in determining whether you satisfy our account criteria. Unless you provide the requested information and documentation, we may not be able to open your Account.</p>
                        
                <p>By applying for an NCX Account, you agree to provide the information and documentation requested by NCX Digital Exchange LLC.</p>
                        
                <p>The NCX customer due diligence (“CDD“) procedure requires the Users to provide NCX with reliable, independent source documents to identify them and confirm their residential address. Such documents may include, for example, a national ID card, an international passport, a bank statement, a utility bill. For such purposes, NCX reserves the right to collect the Users’ identification information for the purposes of compliance with its AML/CFT and KYC Policy.</p>

                <p>NCX will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information provided by Users. NCX will also look to verify identification information through secondary sources, and NCX reserves the right to investigate further the cases of Users where NCX is not satisfied with the documentation submitted.</p>
                
                <p>NCX reserves the right to verify the identity of the User on an ongoing basis, especially when its identification information has been changed or its activities appear suspicious (unusual for a particular User). In addition, NCX reserves the right to request from the Users current documents, even if they have been authenticated in the past.</p>

                <p>Information about the user’s identification will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the NCX’s Privacy Policy and relevant rules. The User agrees that if any information provided in the Account application changes, ceases to be true or becomes materially misleading (including, but not limited to, the ownership of the Account) then the User will notify NCX of the changes.</p>

                <p>After confirming the identity of the user, NCX may refuse to provide Services to the User if NCX’s Services are suspected to be used for the purposes of conducting illegal activities.</p>

                <p>NCX has a regulatory requirement to verify the sources of Fiat Money and/or Cryptocurrency to know that the sources of the Funds that Users use to trade with are legitimate. NCX will require evidence of the source of Funds; this may include bank statements for Fiat Money or a video showing wallet transaction details for Cryptocurrency.</p>

                <p>Users who intend to use payment cards for the purpose of consuming Services must undergo a card check in accordance with the instructions available on the NCX’s Site.</p>
                
                <p>NCX uses independent third-party companies for the following:</p>

                <p>check Users against Politically Exposed Person’s (PEP) and Sanctions Lists as well as checks for Adverse Media.</p>

                <p>assess User’s cryptocurrency wallets with regards to AML investigation and compliance.</p>

                <h3>Chief Compliance Officer</h3>

                <p>The Chief Compliance Officer is the person, duly authorised by NCX, whose duty is to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the AML/CFT and KYC Policy. It is the Chief Compliance Officer’s responsibility to supervise all aspects of NCX’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing procedures, in particular:</p>

                <p>The Chief Compliance Officer is the contact point for NCX with law enforcement agencies for the purposes of prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities.</p>
                
                <h3>Transaction Monitoring</h3>

                <p>NCX Users must complete the NCX’s identity verification process (who you are) before trading. After verification is completed the User consents to transaction Monitoring, NCX analyses User’s transactional patterns (what they do).</p>

                <p>NCX relies on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicious activity detection tools. These tools perform a variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data, filtering, record-keeping, investigation management and reporting.</p>

                <p>In connection with the AML/CFT and KYC Policy, NCX will:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>monitor all transactions. NCX reserves the right to ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement;</li>
                    <li>request the User to provide any additional information and documents in case of suspicious transactions;</li>

                <p>However, the above list is not exhaustive and the Chief Compliance Officer will monitor Users’ transactions on a regular basis in order to define whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious.</p>
                  
                <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>

The aim of the AML Risk Assessment is to prevent criminals using NCX to launder money by highlighting risks and assessing controls NCX has put in place. A risk-based approach is taken to identify Users and monitor how they use our Services.</p>
                        
                <p>The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for managing financial crime risks and making improvements in financial crime risk management through identifying the general and specific money laundering risks that NCX is facing, determining how these risks are mitigated by the NCX’s AML controls and establishing the residual risk that remains for NCX.</p>
