                        <li>NCX created a sophisticated complex system of internal security, control, monitoring, in which all actions of employees are logged and recorded. In addition, the system makes it impossible for our employees to receive the User’s credentials.

The procedures/policies of the appropriate financial institutions may also set limits on the amount of one-time Withdrawals. In this case, the part of the Withdrawal amount exceeding the established limits can be withdrawn by the User later. The User confirms and agrees that Depositing and Withdrawing the Fiat Money to/from his/her Account may take a long time due to technical or other problems of a third-party financial institution, for which NCX is not and cannot be liable. The User also confirms and agrees that Depositing and Withdrawing the Funds in Digital assets to/from his/her Account may take a long time because of the appropriate blockchains and their data exchange with NCX, besides the occurrence of unforeseen or unavoidable problems on the network/blockchain is possible.</span></li>
