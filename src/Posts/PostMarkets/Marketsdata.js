    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Global stocks headed for their best weekly gains since November on bets that the US monetary tightening cycle is nearing an end. The yen rallied for a seventh day.</p>
    	<p>Most stock indexes advanced in Asia, while European and US equity futures were little changed. The gains in Asia helped extend the MSCI ACWI Index’s weekly rally to above 3%. Optimism about stronger efforts to bolster the Chinese economy also buoyed sentiment.</p>	
    	<p>“We’re going to get more fiscal stimulus, more fiscal support from the government and I think that that could potentially ignite some animal spirits in China,” David Chao, global market strategist for Asia Pacific at Invesco Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. “A lot of the pessimism for Chinese equities appears to be overdone at these levels.”</p>
      <p>Stocks fluctuated in Japan as the yen headed for a seven-day winning streak, which would mark its best performance since 2018.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the selloffs of JGBs and the yen’s recent moves — or yen’s strength, it seems speculation about the BOJ’s policy tweak is encouraging investors to unwind their positions,” said Teppei Ino, the Tokyo head of global markets research at MUFG Bank.</p>
    	<p>The Bank of Japan will probably adjust its yield curve control program at its policy meeting this month as inflation is stronger than expected, said Hideo Hayakawa, a former executive director at the central bank, in an interview Thursday. “If they don’t, it doesn’t make sense.”</p>
      <p>The dollar slipped for a sixth-straight session. That put an index of the currency’s strength on pace for the worst week since November. Treasuries were little changed in Asia.</p>
      <p>The offshore yuan ticked higher. China has ample foreign exchange reserves and will “resolutely” prevent wild swings in the yuan exchange rate, People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor Liu Guoqiang said at a briefing Friday. The currency’s short-term movement cannot be predicted accurately, but it hasn’t deviated from its fundamentals, Liu added.</p>
      <p>Easing Inflation</p>
      <p>Wall Street and markets globally got an extra dose of encouragement to bid up riskier assets after another US inflation report highlighted the view that price pressures are easing in the world’s largest economy. Tech megacaps led gains on Thursday, with the S&P 500 topping 4,500. Yields on policy-sensitive two-year Treasuries dropped 12 basis points to 4.63%.</p>
      <p>The producer price index for final demand rose 0.1% in June from a year earlier, the smallest advance since 2020. The figures came just a day after data showed consumer prices increased at the slowest pace since 2021.</p>
      <p>Disinflation has become a buzzword across trading desks, even though core inflation is still running above the central bank’s 2% target. Equities gained further traction on news that Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard — who called for aggressive hikes — has resigned.</p>
      <p>“The Fed has already won the battle against inflation,” Raffaele Bertoni, head of debt capital markets at Gulf Investment Corp., said on Bloomberg Television. “If they want to be serious in maintaining inflation under control, the focus should be more on the reduction of the balance sheet or the quantitative tightening rather than increasing rates further.”</p>
      <p>Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly, however, told CNBC Thursday that it’s too soon for policymakers to say they have done enough to return US inflation to their target. Fed Governor Christopher Waller also said he expects the US central bank will need to raise rates twice more this year to bring inflation down to its target.</p>
      <p>Traders are also awaiting the unofficial start of the second-quarter US earnings season Friday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists expect US companies to be able to meet the low bar set by consensus. Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Gina Martin Adams said “the S&P 500 earnings season will likely reveal more of the ‘less bad than feared’ trend that emerged in 1Q.”</p>
      <p>In commodities, oil headed for a third weekly gain as supply disruptions in Africa and a reduction in shipments from Russia tightened the market. Gold was set for the best week since April.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stocks marched higher Thursday after investors received data—for a second consecutive day—showing that inflation is moderating to its slowest pace in years.</p>
    	<p>The Labor Department reported the producer-price index rose in June at a weaker clip than economists expected. That followed Wednesday’s report that showed consumer inflation fell to multiyear lows.</p>	
    	<p>Investors continued piling into big tech stocks, encouraged by signs that the worst of the inflation fight is over and the economy remains strong. Amazon.com jumped 2.7% on the back of its Prime Day sale, while chip-maker Nvidia added 4.7%. The 2.3% rise in the communication services segment led the S&P 500, followed by information technology.</p>
      <p>Shares of Google parent Alphabet were among the market’s best performers, rising 4.7% after updating its Bard chatbot. That helped power the Nasdaq Composite to a 1.6% gain, while the S&P 500 added 0.8%. The blue-chip Dow industrials edged up 47.71 points, or 0.1%.</p>
      <p>“The disinflation narrative is in full effect,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Charlotte, N.C.-based Independent Advisor Alliance. For investors, that means “buying stocks and bonds is the best course of action,” he said, contrary to last year when both suffered from the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate campaign.</p>
      <p>Wall Street is eager to see second-quarter results from the six largest banks over the next few days, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo slated for Friday morning. Earnings from UnitedHealth Group, a healthcare industry bellwether, are also on tap for Friday.</p>
      <p>Shares of financial-services companies have limped along since the March banking crisis. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has declined 16% this year while the S&P 500 is up 17% over the same period—that is the worst bout of underperformance on record, according to a Barclays analysis that goes back to 1937. Analysts will be gleaning earnings for insight into how banks’ recovery from March’s events has progressed.</p>
      <p>The Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, finished below 14, a historically low level associated with complacency. The index is commonly referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge as it measures the price of options often used to protect against market declines. Anxiety is near record lows now that investors have grown confident that the Fed’s forthcoming rate hike could be its last.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar fell to its lowest level in several months and government bond yields continued to slide. The WSJ Dollar Index dropped 0.7% and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield declined to 3.759%, from 3.860% Wednesday. The two-year yield, which is more sensitive to expectations around Fed policy, finished at 4.611% from 4.740%.</p>
      <p>Not everyone on Wall Street is convinced the market rally has room to run. This is prototypical late-cycle behavior, said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of Philadelphia, Pa.-based PNC Asset Management Group. With interest rates expected to remain higher for longer, a recession is a foregone conclusion, she said.</p>
    	<p>“I can’t think of any instances where the market has bottomed this far ahead of a potential recession,” said Agati. “Inflation still isn’t at the Fed’s target, but the market is declaring victory.”</p>
      <p>Agati sees potential for a 10% to 15% correction in stock prices from here, airing concerns about the megacap-tech-led rally. To be sure, there is room for optimism: Any recession is likely to be shallow, she said, and markets will take off once investors feel corporate earnings are nearing a trough.</p>
      <p>PNC is keeping clients fully invested rather than sitting in cash to avoid missing out if and when there is a rebound down the line, she said. Meanwhile, the firm is leaning into what she called quality stocks—shares of highly profitable companies with steady earnings growth and low debt—and high-grade bonds.</p>
      <p>Global stock benchmarks were also boosted by shares of internet companies. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged 2.6% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 1.5%, catching up with Wednesday’s rally in the U.S. and Europe. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.6%.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, oil prices continued to rise. Benchmark U.S. crude advanced 1.5% to $76.89 a barrel, its highest close since late April, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Russia's flagship Urals crude just breached the price cap of $60 a barrel on Tuesday, per S&P Global.</li>
        <li>The price cap came into effect on December 5 and sought to limit Moscow's energy revenues.</li>
        <li>Russia's current-account surplus tanked by 93% in the second quarter of this year.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Russia's economy is struggling, but the commodities giant could be getting an uptick in its flagship oil price — the Urals crude oil price just breached a crucial cap for the first time since December 5.</p>
    	<p>A $60-a-barrel price cap has been imposed on Russia by the G7 countries to achieve two goals: it would limit Moscow's energy revenues being routed into the Ukraine war, and it still allowed Russian oil to continue flowing to the world economy, thereby keeping a lid on red-hot inflation.</p>
      <p>But Russia's flagship Urals crude oil prices have busted the price cap to reach $60.32 on Tuesday —  its highest level since mid-November 2022, according to a S&P Global commodity insights report.</p>
      <p>An unnamed European oil trader told S&P there's strong demand for Russian oil from Indian buyers. China has also been snapping up cargoes, Insider's Phil Rosen reported in April. However, both countries have demanded huge discounts for their purchases.</p>
      <p>The development could dent the Western-led efforts to hit Russia's war chest, which has so far proven to be quite effective.</p>
      <p>After all, the price cap has severely hit Russia's coffers this year. The country posted a current-account surplus of $5.4 billion in the second quarter — marking a massive 93% plunge from a record $76.7 billion surplus in the same period last year, according to Russia's central bank data released Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But Russia is an important commodity producer. It can impact the global supply — and prices — of raw materials.</p>
      <p>The country announced an upcoming oil production cut earlier this month alongside another key oil producer Saudi Arabia.</p>
    	<p>These production cuts prop up oil prices as demand outsizes supply, an unnamed European oil trader told S&P.</p>	
    	<p>The benchmark US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were up 0.2% at $75.90 a barrel at 2.29 ET on Thursday. The global benchmark Brent crude oil prices were up 0.3% at $80.33 a barrel.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stocks closed higher Tuesday in the countdown to inflation reports that could give the Federal Reserve cause to consider ending its interest rate hikes sooner.</p>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the day's gains to close up 0.93%, or more than 315 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.55%.</p>	
    	<p>Early Tuesday, the NFIB survey on US business confidence showed optimism rose to a seven-month high in June, but a still-tight labor market continued to drive concerns about price pressures.</p>	
    	<p>At the same time, investors weighed comments from Fed officials that more rate hikes are needed as they look ahead to consumer and producer inflation reports due later this week.</p>
      <p>Also on the radar: signs that China is gearing up to support its faltering economy, while Amazon kicks off its Prime Day promotion that will be watched for a read on retail and the American consumer.</p>
      <h3>Stocks close higher ahead of highly anticipated inflation data</h3>
      <p>Stocks closed Tuesday's trading session higher as investors await Wednesday's critical US inflation data.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the day's gains to close up 0.93%, or more than 315 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added 0.55%.</p>
      <h3>JetBlue sputters after fresh Wall Street downgrade</h3>
      <p>JetBlue Airways (JBLU) stock ticked lower on Tuesday, falling as much as 3%, after Evercore ISI downgraded shares to Underweight from In-line on balance sheet concerns.</p>
      <p>Analysts, who left the price target unchanged at $8 a share, cited the airline's pending merger with Spirit, which will cost JetBlue $3.8 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>“While there will be twists and turns along the way, we believe the Spirit acquisition ultimately gets done while the premium JBLU is paying for Spirit continues to expand,” wrote Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfennigwerth and his team.</p>
      <p>The company’s “balance sheet is on a journey from average to worst,” they added.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Delta (DAL), which kicks off airline earnings on Thursday, is a top pick at Evercore ISI. The company is expected to double its profit over the second quarter of last year on the back of lower costs and pricing power.</p>
      <p>Calling it a “strong leadoff hitter,” the analysts noted Delta “has done a nice job expectation-setting this year, aided by lower fuel, while a recent investor day was a good reminder of Delta’s positive longer term attributes.” The company aims at prioritizing free cash flow and debt reduction.</p>
      <p>Lower jet fuel costs are expected to balance out higher labor expenses. Earlier this year, Delta announced a new agreement with pilots that offers $7 billion in higher pay and benefits.</p>
      <h3>JPM hires former SVB executive</h3>
      <p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM) hired a former Silicon Valley Bank executive to help lead its commercial banking team, the company announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>JPM announced the hiring of John China, who spent 27 years working for Silicon Valley Bank and its parent company SVB Financial. Most recently he was president of SVB Capital, the parent company's venture capital unit.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. Its parent company filed for bankruptcy one week later. SVB Capital had $9.5 billion in assets under management, according to a March 19 bankruptcy court filing.</p>
      <p>China will co-head JPMorgan's innovation economy practice, which sits inside JPMorgan's commercial bank. He will be based in San Francisco, running the practice alongside current JPMorgan executive Melissa Smith, who is based in New York City.</p>
      <p>"John and Melissa’s industry expertise and extensive experience will provide coast-to-coast leadership during this pivotal time for our clients," John Simmons, head of JPMorgan’s middle market commercial banking business, said in a Tuesday release.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan's innovation economy practice is seven years old and focuses on venture capital and startup lending for an array of technology businesses including life sciences, healthcare IT, and climate tech.</p>
      <p>“The founders and investors who make up the innovation economy are tackling some of the biggest issues facing our world today. They’re creating jobs, technology, and opportunities that are uplifting communities and driving the global economy forward,” Simmons added.</p>
      <h3>Why Prime Day will create 'halo effect' for other e-commerce giants</h3>
      <p>Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day is currently underway – and its impact will likely benefit other e-commerce retailers amid a strong start to the summer shopping season.</p>
      <p>The two-day sale, set to run Tuesday and Wednesday, features steep discounts for everyday products like toothbrushes and deodorant to more high-end products like blenders and noise-canceling headphones.</p>
      <p>Amazon shares were up about 1% on Tuesday and have climbed more than 50% since the start of the year.</p>
      <p>"Prime Day is always a major shopping event, but this year it will be a bellwether for early holiday shopping amidst high inflation and rising interest rates that have consumers more cautious of their spending," said Michael Greene, SVP of global vertical strategy at Criteo.</p>
      <p>Amazon's Prime Day has created an ecosystem in which there are major savings opportunities for consumers, ones that they're likely to take advantage of at Amazon — and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"It’s not just Amazon that benefits from the summer shopping excitement," said Greene. "Other retailers have launched competing events — like Walmart+ Week and Target Circle Week — that led to a boost in traffic and sales. That, in a nutshell, is the Prime Day 'halo' effect."</p>
      <p>This means that Prime Day hasn't just created an ecosystem in which Amazon is making money – it's created one where shopping is happening across e-commerce retailers.</p>
      <p>"I expect Prime Day will drive adjacent sales for other retailers this year more than any other," said Kevin Dunn, VP of industry sales, retail, and consumer packaged goods at LiveRamp. "Retailers seem to believe that consumer spending will stay on the rise and reach record highs by the fall holiday season. Inflation is not slowing down consumer spending, but it does have shoppers looking for the best price. Savvy retailers will capitalize on this trend to drive consumers to their own sales events online and in-store. Some of these retailers have already lined up some of the most aggressive sales I’ve seen in a while."</p>
      <p>In 2022, Prime Day generated a record-breaking $12 billion in sales, and customers bought more than 300 million items globally. The sale will end on July 12.</p>
      <h3>PGA Tour-LIV Golf rivalry takes Capitol Hill</h3>
      <p>PGA Tour officials testified on Capitol Hill on an agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf to merge entities.</p>
      <p>The officials defended their decision to make peace with Saudi-backed LIV Golf before US lawmakers on Tuesday, saying they believe a proposed deal to merge the two entities would not violate US antitrust law and would preserve the league long term.</p>
      <p>The hearing comes after the PGA Tour reached an agreement with LIV Golf to end antitrust litigation amid growing concerns the PGA Tour wouldn't be able to keep pace with the LIV Golf tour, which is backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund. The upstart league offered lucrative contracts to players, with multiple contracts reportedly worth more than $100 million.</p>
      <p>"My fear is if we don't get an agreement...They are already putting billions of dollars into golf," PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne said. "They have an unlimited amount of money. That will make people move because [the PGA Tour] isn't that big. It's only a couple hundred players."</p>
      <p>While much of Tuesday's hearing didn't center around antitrust law or anything pertinent to the agreement happening, previously unknown financial details were revealed. Discussions have centered around the PIF providing the new golf entity an amount "north" of $1 billion, per PGA Tour COO Ron Price.</p>
      <p>The PIF, which has advanced investments in US companies to diversify its largely oil-centric portfolio, holds investments of over $1 billion in six publicly traded US companies, per its most recent 13F filing.</p>
      <h3>Stocks edge higher ahead of inflation data</h3>
      <p>Stocks edged slightly higher in midday trading on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's key inflation data and a kickoff to earnings season later this week.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded up 0.5%, or more than 175 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) remained muted.</p>
      <h3>Game on! Microsoft wins US court approval to buy Activision Blizzard</h3>
      <p>In a major win for Microsoft (MSFT), a federal judge in California ruled on Tuesday the tech giant can complete its $69 billion purchase of video game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI).</p>
      <p>Shares of Activision climbed on the news, up about 6%. Microsoft shares were muted.</p>
      <p>The decision follows five days of testimony and comes after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requested a preliminary injunction to derail the acquisition. The FTC can still file a motion to appeal the decision.</p>
      <p>In her ruling, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote:</p>
      <p><strong>This Court’s responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action. For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.</strong></p>
      <h3>DraftKings soars on bullish sentiment as shares hit 52-week high</h3>
      <p>DraftKings (DKNG) stock is riding a fresh 52-week high as investors turn bullish on the sports betting company after shares plummeted nearly 60% in 2022.</p>
      <p>For DraftKings, 2023 has brought a much-needed narrative shift as the operator has ticked away at industry leader FanDuel's market share in certain areas and has begun to win more frequently against its bettors.</p>
      <p>Multiple Wall Street analysts have recently raised their price targets, noting the Street hadn't expected this strong of a first half of the year for DraftKings.</p>
      <p>"The industry has been better than expected given single game parlays and reduction in promos, so I think that's good for the overall space, mainly DraftKings and FanDuel," Macquarie Securities managing director Chad Beynon told Yahoo Finance.</p>
      <p>DraftKings surprised the Street to the upside during its first quarter earnings release in May, posting revenue of $769.65 million versus Street estimates for $705.18 million.</p>
      <p>Most notably, the company guided for a full-year adjusted EBITDA loss of $315 million in 2023, down from prior guidance for a loss of $400 million. The path to profitability has been a central part of the investor story for DraftKings, which has yet to post positive quarterly EBITDA since its April 2020 initial public offering.</p>
      <p>Wall Street analysts expect that to change next month, though. Consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg currently project DraftKings to post $5.83 million in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter when the company reports in early August. That's more than a 100% increase from its results for the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Shares of DraftKings are up more than 150% since the start of the year.</p>
      <h3>Inflation expected to cool further in June but that won't stop the Fed</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday, investors will be closely monitoring one of the most important data points for the future of Federal Reserve policy — the June inflation report.</p>
      <p>The closely watched Consumer Price Index (CPI), set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show consumer prices cooled even further last month, with headline inflation forecast to rise 3.1% over the prior year, in a continued slowdown from May's 4% annual gain, according to estimates from Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>A 3.1% increase would mark the slowest annual increase in consumer prices since March 2021.</p>
      <p>Over the prior month, consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.3% in June, up from the 0.1% monthly increase seen in May.</p>
      <p>On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in June are expected to have risen 0.3% over the prior month and 5% over last year, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
      <p>According to a new note from Citi, the slowdown will be largely tied to further easing in shelter prices — which has long been widely expected — along with a decline in used car prices.</p>
      <p>Still, inflation is expected to remain significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That, along with last week's jobs report data that showed a resilient labor market with unemployment low and wages high, suggests the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates this year.</p>
      <p>Currently, markets are pricing in a roughly 92% chance the Federal Reserve raises rates by another 0.25% later this month, according to data from the CME Group.</p>
      <h3>Stocks open higher as investors await CPI data</h3>
      <p>Stocks opened in slightly positive territory on Tuesday after US small business confidence hit a seven-month high in June and investors continue to await Wednesday's much-anticipated inflation report.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the open, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the morning's gains at 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup kick off bank earnings early Friday. JPM stock, WFC and C shares are near buy points.</p>
    	<p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) kick off quarterly bank earnings early Friday. JPM stock, WFC and C are all nearing buy zones ahead of the banks' respective reports.</p>	
    	<p>The worst of the bank panic appears to have subsided following the string of failures earlier this spring. Banks posted six of the 10 worst losses among S&P 500 stocks through early July. Still, financial firms look in better shape after all 23 institutions included in the Federal Reserve's annual stress test passed a hypothetical "severe" recession scenario in late June.</p>	
    	<p>Customer deposits stabilized in recent months, but regulators note that commercial real estate loans could be the next weak point on balance sheets as commercial real estate prices are projected to decline.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley forecasts commercial property prices could fall as much as 40%, according to an April 4 research note, which was in line with the stress-test scenario. The firm did not include a timeline for the expected decline, but said new lending rates are likely to be 3.5 to 4.5 percentage points higher than current rates as commercial mortgages are scheduled for refinancing "in the next couple of years."</p>
      <p>That burden will fall to small and midsize banks, which represent 80% of commercial real estate lending. The larger firms that passed the Fed stress test accounted for 20% of office and downtown commercial real estate loans.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect strong net interest income growth due to sustained high interest rates. However, JPMorgan warned of slower lending and loan growth across large and regional banks later this year in an early-April research note.</p>
      <h3>JPM Stock: Record Quarterly Revenue</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones giant JPMorgan is coming off a strong quarter, posting record quarterly revenue of $38.35 billion for its Q1 results in mid-April.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect the trend to continue with a fourth straight quarter of earnings and revenue growth for JPMorgan. FactSet analysts project earnings to leap 43% to $3.95 per share on 28% revenue growth to $39.36 billion.</p>
      <p>Net interest income is seen spiking 39.8% to $21.14 billion.</p>
      <p>JPM stock is trading in a buy zone for a flat base after surpassing the 143.37 buy point on June 14. Shares are holding above their technical moving averages and about 1.4% above their 10-day line.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan leads the Banks-Money Center IBD industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. JPM stock has a 96 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. The Composite Rating combines various technical indicators into one easy-to-read score. Shares have a 92 EPS Rating. JPMorgan's relative strength line is off highs from the beginning of the year and has an 84 RS Rating.</p>
      <p>JPM stock rose 1.6% to 147.41 Tuesday. Shares have advanced 10% so far this year.</p>
      <h3>Wells Fargo</h3>
      <p>Wells Fargo topped expectations for its Q1 results, posting a 40% jump in earnings as revenue climbed 17%. For the second quarter, analysts expect earnings to bolt 58% to $1.17 per share after two quarters of decelerating growth. Revenue growth is projected to accelerate for the second straight quarter, surging 18% to $20.12 billion. Analysts expect net interest income to vault 25% to $12.83 billion.</p>
      <p>WFC stock is trading in a cup base with a 48.84 buy point, according to MarketSmith. Shares could form a handle Wednesday just above the 200-day moving average, which would provide an early entry opportunity around 43.</p>
      <p>WFC stock rose 1% to 42.77 Tuesday. Shares climbed 3.5% year-to-date.</p>
      <h3>Citigroup</h3>
      <p>Citigroup earnings rose in Q1 after five straight quarters of declines, topping forecasts of an 18.8% drop. But analysts think it'll be a short-lived victory and see earnings plummeting 38.4% to $1.35 per share for Q2. Revenue is expected to dip 1.2% to $19.4 billion after four quarters of accelerating growth. Net interest income is seen rising 8.7% to $13 billion.</p>
      <p>C stock is trying to find its way out of a long-term consolidation but is still trading below its major technical moving averages.</p>
      <p>Citigroup stock swung 1.9% higher Tuesday. C shares have gained 2.9% so far in 2023.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Shares of Apple, Microsoft and other heavyweight companies dipped on Monday after Nasdaq Inc said it would rebalance its Nasdaq 100 index to address the benchmark's "overconcentration."</p>
    	<p>Apple dropped 1.1%, leaving its market capitalization at $2.967 trillion. It closed above the $3 trillion threshold for the first time on June 30. Alphabet and Amazon fell over 2%, while Microsoft and Tesla each slid more than 1%.</p>

    	<p>The adjustment will be based on shares outstanding as of July 3, with changes announced on July 14 and taking effect before the market opens on July 24.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100 includes 100 of the largest companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange, and changes to the index will force investment funds that track it to adjust their portfolios and sell shares of companies that have their weight in the index reduced.</p>
      <p>Wall Street's most valuable companies have been among the biggest winners in the U.S. stock market's recovery this year, further increasing their weight in the Nasdaq 100, and also in the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500.</p>
      <p>While the S&P 500 has gained 15% year to date, Nvidia has surged 189% and Tesla has more than doubled. Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have climbed between 38% and 51% in 2023.</p>

	    <p>The brokerage cut its rating on U.S. stocks to "neutral" from "overweight", following a strong rally in the first half of the year. It warned that growth stocks were set for a pullback as the "euphoria" around artificial intelligence enters a more "digestive" phase.</p>	
    	<p>Citigroup instead sees potential in "heavily discounted" European stocks, as the bank increased allocation to some cyclicals. These include the materials sector, which is seen benefiting from a potential uptick in China's economic growth.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 has gained 14.6% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped about 31%, driven mainly by a handful of tech stocks that rode high on AI potential.</p>
      <p>Futures tracking the S&P 500 were flat by 8:00 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>Citigroup also downgraded the global IT sector to "neutral".</p>
      <p>Strategists at the brokerage downgraded UK stocks on a lack of exposure to growth stocks and a stronger pound. Emerging market (EM) stocks, upgraded to an "overweight" rating, replaced the UK stocks in Citigroup's asset allocation.</p>
      <p>"EM offers a more interesting risk/reward profile, with exposure to a combination of growth and materials. It could also benefit from USD weakness, rate cuts and potential improvement in China sentiment," the strategists said.</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - China's Ant Group has announced a surprise share buyback that values the fintech giant at $78.5 billion, well below the $315 billion touted in an abandoned IPO in 2020, in a move that may let some investors exit.</p>
	    <p>The announcement came after China's financial regulator on Friday fined the Alibaba Group affiliate $984 million for violating laws and regulations, a move seen by many industry observers as a sign that a regulatory crackdown on the country's technology sector is over.</p>	
	    <p>Here is what people are saying about the news:</p>	
    	<p>GARY NG, ASIA PACIFIC SENIOR ECONOMIST AT NATIXIS IN HONG KONG:</p>
      <p>"The major pressure that a lot of these companies have been facing is really this bad sentiment. There are a few things that have changed from last Friday. The first is that some companies have been fined a significant amount but I think that offers, like a certain comfort to the market that possibly this regulatory tightening is actually getting to the end or basically cannot be worse than before.</p>
      <p>"And second, of course, we're talking about the share buyback plan. I think that also helps boosting the sentiment of the share price."</p>
      <p>KENNY NG, SECURITIES STRATEGIST AT CHINA EVERBRIGHT SECURITIES IN HONG KONG:</p>
      <p>"Ant Group has announced a repurchase plan, which reflects a significant decrease in the company's valuation compared to its previous preparation for IPO. However, this news did not cause a drop in Alibaba's stock price, but instead showed a clear upward trend. This is believed to be mainly due to the fact that the People's Bank of China imposed a fine of 7.123 billion renminbi on Ant Group and its subsidiaries last Friday, and investors anticipate that the regulatory crackdown on Alibaba that has lasted for several years is coming to an end.</p>
      <p>"Looking back over the past few years, Alibaba's stock price has experienced a significant decline, mainly due to concerns in the market about the negative impact of industry regulation on the company. If investors can eliminate their concerns about this aspect of Alibaba, it will help the company's stock price rebound in the future."</p>
      <p>DICKIE WONG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT KINGSTON SECURITIES IN HONG KONG:</p>
      <p>"Their share prices have strongly rebound today mainly driven by the expectation that regulatory pressure from mainland government will ease. Ant Group is on the right track to achieve their final target of an IPO."</p>
      <p>SUMEET SINGH, DIRECTOR AT AEQUITAS RESEARCH IN SINGAPORE WHO PUBLISHES ON SMARTKARMA:</p>
      <p>"I don't think the valuation drop is going to hamper their chances of going public, it's a different company now with changed profitability and growth dynamics. In addition a lot of other tech darlings have also corrected by a lot over the past two years, so they aren't alone. With the regulatory episode now behind it investors can be a little more certain that it won't face another regulatory headwind anytime soon."</p>
      <p>OSHADHI KUMARASIRI, ANALYST AT LIGHTSTREAM RESEARCH IN COLOMBO:</p>
      <p>"This means IPO is essentially put on hold. According to the company, the reason for the buyback is providing liquidity to existing investors and attracting and retaining talented individuals through employee incentives. Ant could have achieved both these objectives through an IPO."</p>

    	<p>By Julie Zhu and Josh Ye</p>
    	<p>HONG KONG (Reuters) -Ant Group on Saturday announced a surprise share buyback that values the fintech giant at $78.54 billion, well below the $315 billion touted in an abandoned IPO in 2020, in a move that may let some investors exit after a lengthy regulatory overhaul of the firm.</p>	
    	<p>The news came one day after Ant was fined $984 million, which should end a years-long regulatory shake-up of the company and mark a key step to concluding a crackdown on the country's internet sector.</p>	
    	<p>Ant said it had proposed to all of its shareholders to repurchase up to 7.6% of its equity interest at a price that represents a group valuation of approximately 567.1 billion yuan ($78.54 billion).</p>
      <p>That represents a steep 75% discount to the $315 billion valuation in 2020 for what was set to be the world's largest IPO had it not been derailed at the last minute by Chinese regulators.</p>
      <p>"The repurchased shares will be transferred into Ant Group's employee incentive plans to attract talents. The repurchase proposal will also provide a liquidity option for the company's investors," it said.</p>
      <p>Ant's major shareholders, Hangzhou Junhan Equity Investment Partnership and Hangzhou Junao Equity Investment Partnership, have voluntarily decided not to participate in the repurchase, the company added.</p>
      <p>Hangzhou Junhan and Hangzhou Junao are the entities that collectively hold more than 50% of Ant's shares on behalf of the company's executives and employees.</p>
      <p>"While Ant buys back shares at a valuation much lower than the $150 billion figure in the company's last fundraising round in 2018, the plan provides some liquidity to its existing investors," said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset Management which is an investor of Ant's affiliate, e-commerce titan Alibaba.</p>
      <p>"Liquidity might be more important than valuation for some investors that look to exit."</p>
      <p>He said neither did he nor the markets expect the share buyback at this stage.</p>
      <p>China's central bank said on Friday that financial regulators would fine Ant and its subsidiaries a total of 7.12 billion yuan.</p>
      <p>The imposition of the penalty is seen as paving the way for the firm to secure a financial holding company license, to focus on bolstering growth, and eventually, to revive its plans for a stock market listing.</p>
      <p>"China needs to resolve the Ant IPO to restore investor confidence," said Wang Qi, chief executive of China-focused asset manager MegaTrust Investment.</p>
      <p>"Any progress here not only benefits Alibaba, but is also good for the internet and fintech industries as a whole."</p>
      <p>Founded by billionaire Jack Ma, Ant operates China's ubiquitous mobile payment app Alipay as well as consumer lending and insurance products distribution businesses among others.</p>
      <p>Ant in April 2021 embarked on a sweeping business restructuring, which included turning itself into a financial holding company that would subject it to rules and capital requirements similar to those for banks.</p>
      <p>For the broader technology sector, Ant's fine marks a key step towards the conclusion of China's bruising crackdown on private enterprises, which began with the scrapping of Ant's IPO in late 2020 and subsequently wiped billions off the market value of several companies.</p>
      <p>Following the IPO's cancellation and the forced restructuring, some of Ant's global investors cut their valuation of the company, with Fidelity lowering it to $68 billion in mid 2021, Reuters has reported.</p>
      <p>"The buyback price is higher than the valuations made by many institutions internally ... so I believe that some institutions will choose to participate in the buyback," said Hanyang Wang, an analyst at 86Research.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Chinese authorities also announced fines against two Chinese banks, an insurer, and Tencent Holdings' online payment platform Tenpay.</p>
      <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said that most of the prominent problems for platform companies' financial businesses have been rectified and that regulators would now shift from focusing on specific firms to the regular overall regulation of the industry.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The stock market rally retreated modestly as Treasury yields rebounded. Tesla deliveries and Meta's Threads launch were catalysts.</p>
    	<p>The stock market rally retreated to start July, with Treasury yields surging on strong economic data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell modestly, while the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 suffered more-serious losses. An expanding U.S.-China chip feud hit many semiconductor stocks.</p>	
    	<p>Meta Platforms (META) rose as its new Threads app racked up huge sign-ups to kick off a battle vs. Twitter. Tesla (TSLA) and EV plays such as Rivian (RIVN) and BYD (BYDDF) rallied on strong deliveries, while General Motors (GM) and other traditional automakers saw solid Q2 sales.</p>	
    	<h3>Market Rally Pulls Back</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally saw losses in the latest week, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down modestly and the Dow Jones and Russell 2000 losing a little more. Treasury yields jumped above 4% on strong economic data, though Friday's jobs report was mixed. Tesla (TSLA) rallied on strong Q2 deliveries, along with other EV makers and traditional auto plays.</p>
      <h3>Jobs Report Mixed</h3>
      <p>The U.S. economy added 209,000 payroll jobs in June, roughly what was expected before Thursday's ADP blowout. However, just 149,000 of those jobs came from the private sector, 50,000 less than expected and the lowest number since December 2020. Plus, the Labor Department revisions cut a combined 110,000 jobs from the reported gains in April and May.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, temporary help services, which economists look to as a potential leading indicator, shed 12,600 jobs. To be sure, there were some offsetting strong points. Hours worked bounced back, suggesting pronounced weakness in prior months may have been a data quirk. Average hourly wages grew 0.4% on the month. Coming along with upward revisions to wage gains in prior months, that left 12-month wage growth at a steady 4.4%, far above the Fed's comfort level.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the jobless rate ticked back down to 3.6%, with no obvious upward trend. While the June jobs data is clearly strong enough to merit a quarter-point rate hike on July 26, especially with other economic reports generally looking strong, odds dimmed somewhat for additional quarter-point hikes this fall.</p>
      <h3>Meta's Threads Takes Off</h3>
      <p>Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) debuted a microblogging service to compete with Twitter. The new service, called Threads, recorded 30 million sign-ups in its first 16 hours of availability. Instagram users can use their existing credentials to log into the Threads app, making for an easy onboarding process.</p>
      <p>Meta hopes to capitalize on user discontent with Twitter under Elon Musk. Since Musk bought Twitter last October for $44 billion, he has instituted a number of controversial changes. Most recently he capped the number of tweets users could view in a day. Wall Street analysts see the near-term opportunity for Threads as immaterial for Meta, but that would change if it can reach CEO Mark Zuckerberg's goal of 1 billion users.</p>
      <h3>GM Leads U.S. Auto Sales</h3>
      <p>General Motors (GM), Toyota (TM) and Ford Motor (F) grew new vehicle sales in the U.S. more than expected during the second quarter, as supply issues continued to improve. The annualized pace of June sales reached 15.8 million units, up nearly 5% from May. GM led Q2 sales by a margin. News on the all-important shift to electric vehicles was more mixed. Both GM and Ford reported EV momentum, but the numbers told a somewhat different story.</p>
      <p>In Q2, GM sold 15,652 electric vehicles, but mostly older Bolts. Quarterly deliveries of Lyriq and Hummer EVs, which use Ultium batteries, did top 1,000 for the first time. Ford sold 14,843 electric vehicles, not including hybrids, but sales of its newer Mach-E fell 21% amid a plant retooling that crimped the number available for sale.</p>
      <h3>Tesla, EV Rivals Jump On Deliveries</h3>
      <p>Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped to its best level in nearly 10 months after reporting a record 466,140 EV deliveries in Q2, well above estimates. Rivian (RIVN) soared on strong production and deliveries, as well as news that Amazon (AMZN) will start using its vans in Europe. BYD (BYDDF) sold a record 253,045 EVs in June and 703,561 in Q2, with the EV and battery giant announcing plans to build three plants in Brazil and formally launching its Denza N7 crossover.</p>
      <p>Among China EV startups, Li Auto (LI) reported booming sales. Nio (NIO) and XPeng (XPEV) deliveries grew in June vs. May, with Nio benefiting from new and revamped models and optimism growing about XPeng's G6 crossover, which starts deliveries this month.</p>
      <p>Tesla and China's top EV makers including BYD signed a deal pledging to maintain fair competition and avoid "abnormal pricing," signaling a possible end to a damaging price war in the world's biggest EV market</p>
      <h3>U.S.-China Chip Feud Expands</h3>
      <p>The Biden administration plans to restrict Chinese companies' access to U.S. cloud-computing services using advanced AI chips, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing sources. The WSJ report comes a week after reports that the U.S. will expand AI chip export restrictions to China, affecting Nvidia (NVDA) and others. Meanwhile, China restricted two key metals used in advanced chip manufacturing. That hit Qorvo (QRVO) and some other chip plays, while lifting shares of MP Materials (MP).</p>
      <h3>News In Brief</h3>
      <p>AstraZeneca (AZN) and Daiichi Sankyo stocks plummeted Monday after they jointly announced mixed results for their lung cancer treatment. The treatment led to an improvement in progression-free survival — meaning patients who received the drug lived longer before their cancer worsened than patients who received a standard drug. But the results weren't yet clear for overall survival. Further, some patients died while receiving the experimental drug.</p>
      <p>The FDA fully approved Alzheimer's treatment, Leqembi. In response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it would reimburse the cost of the Biogen (BIIB) drug for patients who meet certain criteria.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>JPMorgan stock is back near a buy point ahead of the company's Q2 report. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Delta Air Lines are also set to report.</p>
    	<p>Delta Air Lines (DAL) and JPMorgan (JPM) kick off second-quarter earnings season in the coming week. Delta stock hasn't looked back after soaring out of a cup base last month, while JPMorgan stock has come under selling pressure after trying to clear a flat base.</p>
      <p>The stock market uptrend has come under some selling pressure in recent days, hurt in part by rising interest rates. After jumping 9 basis points Wednesday to around 3.95%, the yield shot up another 9.7 basis points Thursday to 4.04%. The latest jump came after the monthly private payroll report from ADP showed job growth of 497,000 in June, more than double the 235,000 consensus.</p>
      <h3>JPMorgan Stock Tests Buy Area</h3>
    	<p>JPMorgan has one of the better looking charts in the money center group, which ranks in the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.</p>	
	    <p>JPM stock broke out of a flat base last week in heavy volume. But two days of selling have knocked JPM just below a 143.37 entry. Support levels to watch for JPM are the 21-day exponential moving average around 141.50 and 50-day line near 139.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan stock gapped up on April 14 when the company reported strong Q1 results. Adjusted profit rose 37% from the year-ago quarter to $4.10 a share. Revenue increased 25% to $38.3 billion, helped by a 49% jump in net interest income to $20.8 billion.</p>
      <p>For Q2, the Zacks consensus estimate is for adjusted profit of $3.63 a share, up 31.5%, with revenue up 21% to $37.04 billion. Results are due Friday before the open, along with other financial stocks like Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BlackRock (BLK).</p>
      <p>A rising interest rate environment can be good for banks because banks earn money from the difference between the interest rates they charge on loans and the interest rates they pay on deposits. When interest rates rise, the spread between these two rates widens, increasing the banks' net interest margins and ultimately lifting profits.</p>
      <h3>Delta Thrusts Higher</h3>
      <p>Other strong price performers like Delta Air Lines, Cintas (CTAS) and Fastenal (FAST) are scheduled to report Thursday before the open.</p>
      <p>Last month, Delta announced bullish guidance, forecasting full-year adjusted earnings of $6 a share. That was at the high end of a prior forecast in April.</p>
      <p>The airline operator also forecast Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.50, up from prior guidance range of $2 to $2.25 a share. The Zacks consensus is for adjusted profit of $2.42 a share, up 68%. Revenue is expected to increase 9% to $15.01 billion.</p>
      <p>Uniform maker Cintas, meanwhile, has an outstanding Earnings Stability Rank of 5, indicating one of the most consistent track record of annual earnings growth around.</p>
      <p>Quarterly profit is seen rising 13.5% to $3.19 a share, with revenue up 8% to $2.25 billion.</p>
      <p>Fastenal, a distributor of industrial and construction supplies, is still in a buy zone from a 55.34 entry as it holds support at the 21-day exponential moving average.</p>
      <p>Quarterly profit is seen rising 4% to 52 cents a share, with revenue up 6% to $1.89 billion.</p>
      <h3>Options Trading Strategy</h3>
      <p>A basic options trading strategy around earnings — using call options — allows you to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk. Here's how the options trading strategy works and what a call option trade recently looked like for JPMorgan stock.</p>
      <p>First, identify top-rated stocks with a bullish chart. Some might be setting up in sound early-stage bases. Others might have already broken out and are getting support at their 10-week lines for the first time. And a few might be trading tightly near highs and refusing to give up much ground. Avoid extended stocks that are too far past proper entry points.</p>
      <p>In options trading, a call option is a bullish bet on a stock. Put options are bearish bets. One call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specified price, known as the strike price.</p>
      <h3>Check Strike Prices</h3>
      <p>Once you've identified an earnings setup for a call option, check strike prices with your online trading platform, or at Cboe.com. Make sure the option is liquid, with a relatively tight spread between the bid and ask.</p>
      <p>Look for a strike price just above the underlying stock price (out of the money) and check the premium. Ideally, the premium should not exceed 4% of the underlying stock price at the time. In some cases, an in-the-money strike price is OK as long as the premium isn't too expensive.</p>
      <p>Choose an expiration date that fits your risk objective, but keep in mind that time is money in the options market. Near-term expiration dates will have cheaper premiums than those further out. Buying time in the options market comes at a higher cost.</p>
      <p>This options trading strategy lets you capitalize on a bullish earnings report without taking too much risk. Risk is equal to the cost of the option. If the stock gaps down on earnings, the most you can lose is the amount paid for the contract.</p>
      <h3>JPMorgan Stock Option Trade</h3>
      <p>Here's how a recent call option trade looked for JPMorgan, a liquid name in the options trading market.</p>
      <p>When JPMorgan stock traded around 142.50, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with 143 strike price (July 28 expiration) came with a premium of around $3 per share on that contract, or 2.1% of the underlying stock price at the time.</p>
      <p>One contract gave the holder the right to buy 100 shares of JPMorgan stock at 143 per share. The most that could be lost was $300 — the amount paid for the 100-share contract.</p>
      <p>When taking the premium paid into account, JPMorgan stock would have to rally past 146 for the trade to start making money (143 strike price plus $3 premium per contract).</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. soared on a report that China is preparing to announce a fine of more than $1.1 billion on its fintech affiliate, signaling a wide-ranging probe that has weighed on Jack Ma’s empire for years may finally be drawing to a close.</p>
    	<p>China’s central bank is expected to disclose the fine against Ant Group Co. as soon as Friday, Reuters said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. That will allow Ant to seek a financial holding company license, revive growth and eventually resurrect plans for an initial public offering, it added.</p>
      <p>Alibaba’s shares rose 3.4% in Hong Kong on Friday. The company’s American Depositary Receipts rose about 2.6% in premarket trading before New York exchanges opened.</p>
      <p>“The market likes it because scrutiny looks likely to be over and the fine, though big in absolute terms, is very manageable for such a big company,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. An 8 billion yuan fine would be less than the estimated 9.6 billion yuan profit that Ant generated in the December quarter.</p>	
    	<p>The probe into Ant marked the symbolic start of a withering crackdown on the broader Chinese internet industry, which wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the value of sector leaders from Alibaba to Tencent Holdings Ltd. Allowing the fintech giant to resume business growth would kindle hopes that Beijing will finally unfetter its giant private sector, part of a nationwide effort to resuscitate a flagging economy.</p>
      <p>Ant Group didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg request for comment.</p>
      <p>Regulators killed Ant’s IPO in 2020 after Ma angered Beijing with a public critique of financial regulators. The government began a clampdown on the private tech sphere shortly after, accusing Alibaba of monopolistic behavior before levying a record fine for the alleged violations.</p>
      <p>Even if Beijing lifts the clamps on Ant, the years of relentless scrutiny have reduced the billionaire’s empire to a shadow of its former self.</p>
      <p>Ant’s bottom line has eroded since the days it was preparing for the world’s largest IPO in 2020, while Alibaba is in the process of splitting into six main businesses from cloud services to meal delivery and logistics. While investors initially cheered the potential creation of value, Alibaba’s shares have come off their 2023 highs and have shed more than $600 billion of their value since the Ant episode began.</p>
      <p>The central bank ordered Ant to fold all financial units into a holding company in 2021. It also told the firm to open up its payments app to competitors and sever improper linking of payments with other products including its lending services.</p>
      <p>Market watchers had since been awaiting the conclusion of the probe to gauge Beijing’s stance on China’s sprawling internet sector. Authorities had pledged to unwind crackdowns that ensnared private sectors from technology to online education, at a time when the world’s second-largest economy is struggling to get back on its feet.</p>
    	<p>While the latest development may signal Beijing’s efforts to follow through on its pledges to support the sector, more solid actions may be required to stabilize investor confidence. Ant is still awaiting a regulatory greenlight to start reviewing its application for setting up the financial holding company and resume its IPO in the longer run.</p>
      <p>“Ant is a very different company from before with all the restrictions in place and its valuation should be much smaller,” Ling said.</p>
      <p>While Ant fetched a valuation of $280 billion pre-IPO, the myriad regulations imposed over the past two-plus years mean it’s now worth a fraction of that, as it’s now more “fin” than “tech.”</p>
      <p>Ma gave up his controlling rights of Ant earlier this year, complicating its prospects for an IPO anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Companies can’t list domestically on the country’s so-called A-share market if they have had a change in control in the past three years — or in the past two years if listing on Shanghai’s STAR market, which is geared toward new technology companies. For Hong Kong’s stock exchange, this waiting period is one year.</p>

    	<p>By Sinéad Carew</p>
    	<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - MSCI's global equity index ended Friday's session virtually unchanged while the dollar was lower as government data showed that U.S. jobs growth slowed more than expected in June, easing worries about the outlook for Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>	
    	<p>But while investors appeared to hold out hope for a less hawkish Fed, they were also looking cautiously to the week ahead, with key U.S. inflation readings due along with the start of the second-quarter earnings season.</p>	
	    <p>Official U.S. nonfarm payrolls on Friday showed employers added 209,000 new hires in June, below forecasts, while May numbers were revised down by 33,000 to 306,000. Still, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in June from 3.7% in May and average hourly earnings rose 0.4%, the same as May.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, private payroll provider ADP's strong U.S. labor market data had sparked an equities sell-off and boosted Treasury yields.</p>
      <p>While Friday's government data was initially met with a more muted market reaction, stocks gained some ground during the session before losing ground again in afternoon trading.</p>
      <p>"Investors are more cautious going into a very important week with the beginning of earnings season and a very important inflation reading mid week," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist, LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the session traders appeared relieved that payrolls came in "much lower than feared, based on the ADP report," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, adding that investors may have concluded that they "over-reacted" on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Investors still have a bullish mindset and are using near-term weakness as a buying opportunity," Stovall added.</p>
      <p>However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 187.38 points, or 0.55%, to 33,734.88, the S&P 500 lost 12.64 points, or 0.29%, to end at 4,398.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.33 points, or 0.13%, to close at 13,660.72.</p>
      <p>MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.05% after rising as much as 0.6% earlier on Friday. Emerging market stocks lost 0.41%.</p>
      <p>While traders still were still betting on a more than 90% chance that the Fed would raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in late July, expectations for another hike in September fell slightly, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>The dollar slumped after the labor market data as some traders were betting that the Fed could cut rates sooner than previously expected. Also the yen jumped sharply against the dollar.</p>
      <p>The dollar index fell 0.795%, with the euro up 0.73% to $1.0965.</p>
      <p>The Japanese yen strengthened 1.40% versus the greenback at 142.10 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2835, up 0.75% on the day.</p>
      <p>Some U.S. Treasury yields dialed down on Friday, although longer-dated yields were higher, after the jobs data calmed worries the Fed could become more aggressive with rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Benchmark 10-year notes were up 2.3 basis points to 4.064%, from 4.041% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond was last up 4.6 basis points to yield 4.0491%, from 4.003%. But the 2-year note was last was down 6 basis points to yield 4.9459%, from 5.006%.</p>
      <p>In commodities, oil prices rose to 6-week highs as supply concerns outweighed fears about that more rate hikes could slow economic growth and reduce demand for oil.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude settled up 2.87% to $73.86 per barrel and Brent finished at $78.47, up 2.55% on the day.</p>
      <p>Spot gold added 0.7% to $1,924.13 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.89% to $1,925.60 an ounce.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Layoffs in the United States nearly halved in June from a month earlier as job cuts in the technology sector fell, according to data from employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.</p>
    	<p>Corporate America has taken to laying off a large number of their workforce, as aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation have besmirched the United States' economic outlook, stoking fears of a potential recession.</p>	
    	<p>Despite the drop in job cuts in the month, layoffs in June were higher than the corresponding month a year earlier, the report said.</p>	
    	<p>Technology companies continue to lead job cut announcements with 141,516 layoffs in the first half of the year, compared with about 6,000 in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The sector laid off nearly 5,000 employees last month, the report said.</p>
      <p>"In fact, June is historically the slowest month on average for announcements. It is also possible that the deep job losses predicted due to inflation and interest rates will not come to pass, particularly as the Fed holds rates," said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the employment firm.</p>
      <p>Meta Platforms had slashed jobs in May, part of a plan announced in March to eliminate 10,000 roles.</p>
      <p>Like its peers, Amazon.com in March had said it would axe another 9,000 roles as a part of its second retrenchment drive, as investors also persuaded the firms to cut costs.</p>
      <p>After a round of multiple rate hikes, the Fed unanimously kept its interest rates steady at the central bank's June meeting that could freeze layoffs and allay fears of employees.</p>
      <p>"Probably we have already seen the tech sector shed the bulk of its 'at risk' workers, and as such I would expect further Fed tightening to now impact more heavily on other sectors of the US economy," said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital.</p>

    	<p>LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global stocks held steady on Tuesday, as investors balanced the inflationary force of rising oil prices with hopes that central banks would not over-tighten monetary policy into a potential recession.</p>	
    	<p>MSCI's broadest index of world stocks, which rose almost 6% last month as the U.S. Federal Reserve paused its cycle of aggressive rate hikes, was flat in light trading, with Wall Street closed for the July 4 holiday.</p>	
    	<p>Europe's Stoxx 600 share index was flat in early dealings.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the session, Australia's central bank held interest rates steady at 4.1%, saying it needed time to assess the economic impact of its rate hikes so far.</p>
      <p>Complicating the outlook for inflation, oil prices rose on Tuesday as markets weighed supply cuts for August by top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures climbed 0.6% to $75.09 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate crude adding the same amount to $70.23.</p>
      <p>This followed data on Monday from the Institute of Supply Management that showed U.S. manufacturing activity slumped in June to levels last seen during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Purchasing managers surveys showed a similar factory downturn in the euro zone.</p>
      <p>"At least the improved supply-demand imbalance seems to be having an effect on price pressures," Capital Economics global economist Ariane Curtis said.</p>
      <p>Curtis cautioned that despite evidence that goods inflation was easing off, central bankers might keep policy tight to battle service-sector inflation, "which has proven stickier".</p>
      <p>MIXED BAG OF DATA</p>
      <p>Investors are now watching out for a mixed bag of economic data ahead of second-quarter earnings for more trading cues, while uncertainty remains over the outlook for Fed monetary policy, said Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of Asia Pacific equity research at BNP Paribas.</p>
      <p>The minutes from the central bank's last meeting are due later this week and could provide additional clues on policy direction, but also inject some volatility, he said.</p>
      <p>"If the Fed overtightens and decides to do more rate hikes than twice, as the market widely expected, then there's a concern that the recession may turn out to be deeper than what is being factored in," Raychaudhuri said.</p>
      <p>Geopolitical tensions also persist, he noted, with China's export controls on minerals adding more uncertainty around global trade relations.</p>
      <p>In the currency market, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, was flat. The euro dipped 0.3% lower against the dollar to $1.09115.</p>
      <p>Euro zone government debt was steady, with Germany's two-year Schatz yield, which tracks interest rate expectations, drifting around the 3.32% level, around its highest since early March, right before a U.S. regional banking crisis drove a flight into safe havens. Bond yields rise as prices fall.</p>
      <p>The Treasury market was shut on Tuesday for Independence Day. On Monday, a widely watched section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve hit its deepest inversion since the high inflation era of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the early 1980s, reflecting financial markets' concerns that an extended hiking cycle will tip the U.S. into recession.</p>
      <p>Gold was slightly higher, with spot gold traded at $1926.45 per ounce.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- The narrative propelling the global stock rally since mid-March goes like this: The US economy will hold up fine in the face of higher interest rates, and China’s stimulus efforts will help keep that nation’s post-pandemic recovery chugging along.</p>
    	<p>Shrenick Shah, co-manager of the €3.5 billion ($3.9 billion) JPMorgan Global Macro Opportunities Fund, isn’t buying it. Weakness in manufacturing, tightening liquidity and tougher credit conditions all point to a contracting US economy, and optimism about China is unwarranted, he said in an interview last week.</p>	
    	<p>Over the past six weeks, the fund has put on bets that US and European stocks will fall, including a derivatives position that pays off if technology stocks decline. It’s also loaded up on government bonds, he said. For now, his pessimism is costly.</p>	
    	<p>“We think the US is in a contraction,” Shah said. “We see a clear weak industrial or manufacturing cycle that is also clear across the rest of the world. Those views led us towards being short riskier assets and long sovereign bonds.”</p>
      <p>Shah’s take reflects the view among some investors that stocks and the economy can’t possibly hold up in the face of the campaign by central banks to rein in inflation by raising interest rates. One major red flag: Yields on short-term US government debt are well above those on longer-dated bonds, a so-called inverted yield curve that has a long record of correctly predicting recessions.</p>
      <p>Yet the market has defied the skeptics. The MSCI World Index has returned 14% this year, while the frenzy surrounding artificial intelligence has pushed the Nasdaq 100 Index up by 39%.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan Global Macro Opportunities has lost 7.3% over the past month, while an index that tracks short-term cash has returned 0.3%.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit painful to sit in that right now,” said Nicola Rawlinson, lead investment specialist for macro strategies at JPMorgan Asset Management, but the team is convinced that the reality of the economic picture will eventually kick in.</p>
      <p>The fund has wide latitude to invest in stocks, bonds and derivatives based on its analysis of global economic trends, with a goal of beating the return that an investor can achieve by holding cash. It’s returned 3.6% annually over the past decade through May 31, outpacing the annualized 0.2% drop in its benchmark.</p>
      <p>Shah says clients are comfortable with the fund’s positioning, and his team is looking at the situation with an open mind.</p>
      <p>“If the fundamentals shift then, then we’ll shift our views clearly,” Shah said, adding that he will keep a close eye on liquidity and second-quarter results, particularly in tech, industrials and banking.</p>

    	<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) -UBS has gone on a U.S. recruiting drive for wealth managers catering to rich Americans even as it considers culling 30% of its combined global workforce after the takeover of Credit Suisse.</p>	
    	<p>UBS recruited 50 financial advisers, including from Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit, JPMorgan Chase's recently acquired First Republic Bank, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, in the first half of the year. Of those, 30 came after the Credit Suisse deal was announced in March. The largest was BG Group, a 13-person team that managed $2.5 billion at Merrill.</p>
      <p>With the Credit Suisse deal, UBS became the world's second-largest wealth manager. While it has a leading position in Europe and Asia, it is only the fourth-biggest wealth manager in the U.S., where the business of managing the finances of the ultra-rich is dominated by American banks.</p>
      <p>"The U.S. is the largest wealth market globally, and in recent years there has been unprecedented growth," Iqbal Khan, UBS' president of global wealth management, told Reuters. "Investing in and building our business here is a top priority," said Khan, who serves on the bank's executive board.</p>
    	<p>Underscoring the importance of the business, Khan met with high-net-worth clients in southern California on June 12, the day UBS closed its historic deal with Credit Suisse. He also led an internal event with its best-performing financial advisers.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., the acquisition did not change UBS' wealth business because Credit Suisse had exited U.S. private banking in 2015 and transferred about 275 financial advisers to Wells Fargo.</p>
      <p>UBS' ranks of private wealth advisers in the U.S. catering to ultra-high-net-worth clients have swelled by more than 25% in the last three years. The bank had 6,147 advisers in the Americas region in late March, but it declined to specify how many of those were based in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Global banks are investing more in wealth businesses that bring in stable fees, providing a counterweight to volatile operations like investment banking and trading. Most are focusing on ultra-high-net-worth clients, the fastest-growing group.</p>
      <p>That cohort of people with more than $30 million in investable assets is expected to grow 10% over the next five years as they amass more wealth, said John Mathews, UBS head of private wealth management in the Americas.</p>
      <p>"We've been focused on attracting and retaining advisers who are skilled in serving this population," he said.</p>
      <p>The number of millionaires worldwide with net worths above $50 million grew more than 50% between 2019 and 2021, reaching 264,200, according to a Credit Suisse report published last year. More than half of them live in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Wealth is central to UBS' bottom line. The bank is expected to earn 63% of its profits from wealth management within four years, according to Morningstar analyst Johann Scholtz. UBS shares have gained 6.5% this year and 17.5% over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>To strengthen its U.S. position, UBS is focused on the transfer of wealth between baby boomers to their heirs in the coming years. The bank is diversifying its adviser workforce, in terms of age and race, and organizing events for multiple generations of wealthy families.</p>
      <p>About $18 trillion will be passed to younger generations in the U.S. over the next seven years, and as much as $84 trillion over the next two decades, UBS estimates.</p>
      <p>"Over the next 20 years, we'll see the greatest transfer of wealth in history," said Khan, who joined UBS from Credit Suisse in 2019. "That presents a huge opportunity for us to serve a whole new generation of clients."</p>

    	<p>By Yoruk Bahceli</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - Bond investors could be in luck for the rest of 2023 if market indicators signalling central banks will take policy tightening too far and tip their economies into recession prove accurate.</p>	
    	<p>Headline inflation has eased but underlying pressures remain high, keeping central banks hawkish. Canada resumed tightening and Britain and Norway made big moves in June, while U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank officials at last week's Sintra forum signalled more rate hikes.</p>	
    	<p>Markets now anticipate a 25 basis point Fed hike, probably in July, and see a 30% chance of another by November, and have reduced the number of cuts they expect next year.</p>
      <p>They are pricing in two more ECB hikes to 4%, a change from the single hike to 3.75% they foresaw earlier in June, while the Bank of England is expected to raise its main rate near to 6.25%, much more than the 5.5% previously expected.</p>
      <p>Along with those bets, yield curve inversion - where shorter-dated bonds offer higher yields than longer-dated ones, seen as a good sign that investors expect a recession - has deepened as yields on shorter maturities surge.</p>
      <p>U.S. 10-year Treasuries are yielding 104 bps less than two-year peers, the most since March's banking sector mayhem and almost their deepest inversion since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>Similar patterns can be seen in German and British debt.</p>
      <p>"What the yield curve is telling you is that this is extremely tight monetary policy," said Mike Riddell, senior fixed income portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, which manages 514 billion euros ($558.31 billion) in assets.</p>
      <p>"We are positioned for a very big bond rally, and we think that risky assets are completely underestimating the risk of a recession or something nasty happening," he added.</p>
      <p>"I am essentially positioned for this being a policy error."</p>
      <p>BETTER YEAR</p>
      <p>A policy overstep that central bankers had to reverse would be good news for investors in global government bonds, who CFTC data shows have piled up bets that U.S. bond prices will fall.</p>
      <p>That means any turn in sentiment could lead to a big rally, boosting returns that have been less than 2% year-to-date after a 13% loss last year.</p>
      <p>An early sign that the bond outlook is improving came last week with data showing euro zone business growth stalled in June. In response, German bond yields, which move inversely to prices, posted their second biggest daily drop since March.</p>
      <p>But highlighting how hard economic data has become to read, higher-than-expected U.S. first quarter growth and German inflation sent yields surging on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Investors on alert for a policy mistake fear that central bankers are basing their decisions on inflation and other backward-looking data that aren't yet showing the full impact of previous hikes, and overlooking signs of pending disinflation.</p>
      <p>One indicator in focus is producer price inflation, seen as a harbinger of broader inflation. It dropped to 1% annually in Germany and 2.9% Britain in May, the lowest in over two years, and has dropped similarly in the United States.</p>
      <p>"We all made a big deal this time last year when (producer price inflation) was on the way up. But it seems like it's being ignored on the way down," said Vanda Research global macro strategist Viraj Patel.</p>
      <p>Deutsche Bank says the Fed may be "overcompensating" for starting rate hikes too late, pointing to improvements in the labour market, signs of a pending fall in rent inflation and tightening bank lending standards.</p>
      <p>Such forward-looking figures suggest economic data could turn quite sharply, Vanda's Patel said, adding that across big economies, every hike now raised the chance of a policy error.</p>
      <p>Major central banks fighting a surge in inflation have collectively raised borrowing costs by over 3,750 bps since September 2021.</p>
      <p>TRICKY</p>
      <p>Josefine Urban, portfolio manager at Britain's biggest investor, Legal and General Investment Management, said she favoured bets that British government bonds would outperform U.S. and German peers.</p>
      <p>The 10-year yield on UK Gilts has surged 75 bps to 4.43% this year, while yields on U.S. and German equivalents hardly moved.</p>
      <p>"We do think that given (the BoE) are ... mainly focused on lagging data, so they're looking at inflation data, wage data, the labour market, there's quite a big risk that they do over-tighten and that we will then get the recession," Urban said.</p>
      <p>Forecasts aren't always right: late in 2022, 60% of economists polled by Reuters expected a U.S. recession this year, but none has yet materialised and risk assets that would be hit by one have barely blinked.</p>
      <p>But even those not betting on a contraction are cautious.</p>
      <p>"Our base case is not that we're going to get a recession but the risks are definitely growing," said Jill Hirzel, senior investment specialist at Insight Investment.</p>
      <p>Central bankers' "priorities have been made very clear that if the risk is a recession, they're okay with that to bring inflation down," said Hirzel, adding she favoured investing in defensive sectors and higher-rated corporate bonds.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.</p>
    	<p>The big question for the day is how will investors greet Tesla's announcement on Sunday that it delivered a record 466,000 vehicles in the second quarter, topping market estimates of around 445,000.</p>
      <p>The outperformance may have been due to discounting, which is not good for margins, but analysts have still been gushing over the numbers and tipping ever-higher stock prices.</p>
      <p>Back in the real world, China's Caixin/S&P Global survey of manufacturing showed a slowdown to 50.5 in June, but that was not as bad as the 50.2 feared. Chinese blue chips are a touch firmer, perhaps in the hope a new chief at the central bank will bring stronger stimulus.</p>
      <p>The People's Bank of China again pushed back on a weaker yuan by fixing the currency well above expectations, but these official fixings are having less and less of an impact in the market and offshore dealers are testing to see if Chinese banks actually sell dollars to support the yuan.</p>
      <p>News that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will visit China from July 6-9 was taken as another sign the two powers were trying to defrost their relationship, though expectations are far from high.</p>
      <p>Some of the recent hefty gains in the Nikkei seem due to speculation Japanese industry will benefit from a U.S. decoupling with China, particularly in tech. It was notable last week that Japanese chip shares surged amid reports Washington would restrict sales of AI equipment to China.</p>
      <p>The European Union is also acting to deepen cooperation with Japan on semiconductors, as countries move to strengthen control over a technology vital for defence, electronics and autos.</p>	
    	<p>The Bank of Japan's latest Tankan survey of large firms saw an improvement in sentiment to plus 5, from plus 1, which is promising for a country where pessimism had become baked in.</p>	
    	<p>The service index hit its highest since mid 2019 at plus 23, suggesting upbeat domestic demand perhaps in part thanks to the influx of tourists to the country.</p>
      <p>Yet firms still expected inflation to cool to 2.6% in a year's time, from 2.8% in the previous survey, supporting the BOJ's reluctance to move away from super-easy stimulus.</p>
      <p>The U.S. ISM survey of manufacturing due later is expected to have stayed sluggish around 47.0 in June, but more important will be the services survey given May's surprising slowdown. The median forecast is for a rebound to 51.0 and anything weaker will fuel talk of downside risk to payrolls on Friday.</p>
      <p>Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:</p>
      <p>- European Central Bank policymaker Joachim Nagel speaks at a financial conference</p>
      <p>- June U.S. ISM manufacturing survey, PMI and auto sales. Equity and bond markets close early</p>

    	<p>Beneath another rousing advance this week were signs of an increasingly equitable division of rewards, including the best week for small-caps since March and a trouncing of the S&P 500 by a version of the same index that strips out market-value biases. Industries that had previously trailed — from transports to real estate and energy — this time led the way.</p>	
    	<p>The idea that gains would broaden out after being confined to an oligarchy of artificial-intelligence megacaps has been a prong in bull cases all year, and got a boost this week from a clutch of economic reports that again suggested a recession is still a way’s away.</p>	
    	<p>Stocks of all stripes benefited, with nine of ten S&P 500 members climbing. The index’s equal-weighted version beat the traditional one by 1 percentage point for the best week since January.</p>
      <p>“Everybody talks about the Big Seven or whatever number they like about big-cap tech and AI and all that stuff, but they’re not the only ones that are really seeing strength right now,” said Jeff Muhlenkamp, whose Muhlenkamp Fund has cut cash holdings to 15% from 35% in February, scooping up shares in homebuilders, one financial firm and a media company.</p>
      <p>“Certainly six months ago I expected a recession, but now that’s looking a little bit less likely,” he added. “We’re a little bit more optimistic about the economy than we were three and four months ago. We’ve put a little bit of money to work.”</p>
      <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 surged close to 40% in the first half of the year, recouping much of its 2022 losses. A handful of its biggest stocks — contenders in the artificial intelligence race — pushed the benchmark S&P 500 Index up roughly 16%. The Russell 2000, often seen as a proxy for small-cap health, posted a more modest advance of 7.2%.</p>
      <p>Muhlenkamp isn’t the only one buying. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (ticker RSP) is on course for a record inflow of nearly $5 billion for the month of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The ETF tracking the Russell 2000 (IWM) attracted about $1.8 billion of fresh money over the same stretch, poised for the largest addition since February 2021. The optimism helped the Russell 2000 outpace the Nasdaq for the first month this year.</p>
      <p>A $6 trillion rally was not what Wall Street predicted in 2023. Back in January, strategists tracked by Bloomberg called for the S&P 500 to end the year at 4,050. While there is still time for their forecasts to prove correct, it’s worth noting the index now sits 400 points above that target.</p>
      <p>While a report on Friday showed stagnant consumer spending and cooling inflation, earlier data on everything from gross domestic product to new home sales and durable goods orders beat forecasts.</p>
      <p>All told, a Bloomberg index tracking economic surprises has risen in all but two weeks since early April and reached the highest level in more than two years.</p>
      <p>The steadfastness, along with signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for two more rate hikes in 2023, sparked a spike in Treasury yields. Yet unlike in 2022, when the sight of higher borrowing costs sent stocks reeling, now this is perceived as an endorsement of the idea that a widely feared recession is not an imminent threat.</p>
      <p>“It’s contributing to the narrative,” said Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. “Broadening of economic performance can fuel optimism around broader equity market performance.”</p>
      <p>One consequence of a buoyant economy has been a diminishing of volatility, and not just in stocks. A measure of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America has steadily declined in 2023, aside from a spike during the banking turmoil in March. The muted implied volatility fuels the bullish narrative, according to John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors.</p>
      <p>“That whole macro worry that we’ve had: it’s dissipated,” he said. “When an indicator that shows that macro uncertainty is very low, that’s a huge tailwind for stocks.”</p>
      <p>FAANG euphoria may get all the hype, but earnings prospects for small-caps are expected to improve later this year. While income growth from Russell 2000 firms is expected to trail their larger counterparts for the third quarter, it will rebound over the next four periods, with profits expanding at a rate more than triple the S&P 500’s by the middle of 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.</p>
      <p>Performance in factor-based indexes — quant tools that target stocks based on specific characteristics — signals improving market breadth as well. In June, the Dow Jones U.S. Thematic Market Neutral Momentum Index, which buys the market’s winners against losers based on recent returns, underperformed other popular strategies including value, which targets cheap stocks. Year-to-date, the opposite has been true, although neither factor has performed particularly well.</p>
      <p>“The more we see that momentum starts to get flat, to start to underperform the rest of the factors, that means that the breadth of the market starts to get better,” said Omar Aguilar, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Schwab Asset Management.</p>
      <p>Of course, how investors feel at the end of the first half of 2023 depends on what they choose to pay attention to: an inverted yield curve, the Nasdaq’s surge, central bank policy, or something else entirely. And a solid month for smaller companies does not ensure that markets are in the clear, that a recession will be avoided, or that the S&P 500 might reclaim its 2022 highs.</p>
      <p>But it’s still a trend worth noting, Macro Risk Advisors’ Kolovos said.</p>
      <p>“Things are a lot less bad in terms of market breadth,” he said. “I wouldn’t go so far as saying that they’re great yet, but they’re building.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>General Electric (GE) is fast approaching the end of the runway as an iconic American conglomerate. A more svelte and focused GE is preparing to take off in a new direction — as GE Aerospace, a pure-play aviation and defense stock.</p>
    	<p>Investors are so far cheering the change. GE stock hit a new high June 30 and has soared 68% in 2023 so far, after spinning out its GE Healthcare Technologies (GEHC) unit as a separate company late last year. And GEHC stock has climbed 45% since its Jan. 4 debut.</p>	
    	<p>The split-off of GE's power-generation unit, Vernova, is set for early 2024. It will leave a free-standing GE Aerospace and bring the industrial giant's long and intricate restructuring to a close.</p>	
    	<p>Once GE was known as the ultimate conglomerate, with its fingers in everything from light bulbs, refrigerators and washing machines to media, entertainment, financial services, energy systems and jet engines. But in the 2000s, the onetime star stock hit several slides, including an 83% slump from 2016 to 2020. It jettisoned businesses.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, at least for now, the GE bears have fled. Investors have hoisted GE stock to its best level in five years.</p>
      <p>But with the big GE breakup nearing its home stretch, what should investors expect? Will the run-up of GE stock hold its ground? And can the emergence of GE Aerospace make this American icon relevant again after a decadeslong plunge from grace?</p>
      <h3>GE Aerospace Joins Blue Chip Stocks</h3>
      <p>Years of aerospace industry challenges are easing, turning into significant tailwinds for aviation companies. Hurdles remain, however. The soon-to-be GE Aerospace boasts robust growth estimates. And among blue chip stocks, it gives investors a megacap alternative to Boeing (BA) to play defense stocks and the aerospace sector recovery.</p>
      <p>GE Aerospace could also fan industry momentum. There has been speculation of a GE merger with the aerospace unit of Honeywell International (HON). That suggests a combination that could challenge the dominance of Raytheon Technologies (RTX), now branded RTX.</p>
      <p>Several factors have helped lift shares of General Electric and its aerospace peers. China's reopening has been disappointing overall but has stirred an uptick in international travel.</p>
      <p>And, overall, commercial aviation continues to gain steam after taking a big hit early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Global air traffic rose 21% in 2022 and now stands at roughly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, GE says. That means more need for aircraft repair and services, replacement parts and components.</p>
      <p>At the Paris Air Show in June, GE Aerospace revealed an order for more than 100 commercial jet engines from China Airlines and Riyadh Air for their Boeing Dreamliner fleets. Also during the event, both GE and Raytheon signaled improvements in key engine programs and aerospace supply chains.</p>
      <p>On the military side, GE Aerospace revealed it may produce engines for fighter jets locally in India for the first time, as that country and the U.S. expand efforts to counter China's growing diplomatic might.</p>
      <p>"The best days are ahead for this aerospace business because of all the longer-term drivers" of growth, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.</p>
      <h3>Clarifying The GE Aerospace Picture</h3>
      <p>Underpinning Wall Street's bullish view on GE stock is General Electric's massive installed base of aircraft engines. The GE aerospace business boasts 67,000 engines in service across the commercial and defense markets.</p>
      <p>But for many years, other businesses clouded the GE aerospace narrative. Cleaving off health care, power generation and other smaller units clarifies the picture. That makes the line of sight into what makes the jet-engine maker successful and "even more attractive," Dray said.</p>
      <p>The analyst has covered GE stock since 2001, or as Dray likes to say, "since the last year of (legendary GE CEO) Jack Welch." In his view, aerospace was "always the jewel" in a sprawling portfolio of businesses, through all of GE's ups and downs.</p>
      <p>One strength of the GE aerospace unit is that each engine sold produces a steady — and highly profitable — revenue stream for decades to come, due to the need for sophisticated upkeep.</p>
      <p>The GE aerospace business generated $26.1 billion in revenue in 2022, up 22% from 2021. A full 70% of that total came from services. The other 30% was equipment sales. Segment profits totaled $4.78 billion, up 66%, led by the parts and services business and offset by rising shipments of newer and therefore less profitable jet engines.</p>
      <h3>General Electric Separation Of GE Aerospace</h3>
      <p>General Electric plans early next year to separate aerospace from the sole other remaining business — the energy unit that manufactures gas and wind turbines. Since 2009, GE has sold or spun off other assets, from lighting to locomotives, keeping with the larger global trend to demerge corporate conglomerates.</p>
      <p>"The timing has been perfect because investors want this aerospace exposure," Dray said. They're buying the stock although it includes the low-growth energy piece for now.</p>
      <p>Boeing plans to boost production of its bestselling 737 Max and the 787 Dreamliner by the end of this year, on surging demand from airline customers. GE makes engines for both those jets, and also supplies Airbus (EADSY). The company expects commercial air travel to grow 25% annually through 2025, surpassing pre-pandemic levels next year.</p>
      <p>All that points to rising demand for jet engines, as well as components and systems for commercial aircraft. GE also supplies engines and other products for military aircraft, along with a range of services needed to maintain and repair them.</p>
      <h3>GE Stock Hits Highest Stock Price Since 2018</h3>
      <p>Shares of GE stock briefly surged in late 2021. That's when General Electric announced it would spin out its energy and health care units. But at that point, the promise of a stand-alone aerospace and defense stock in 2024 couldn't sustain the shares. The stock stalled for more than a year.</p>
      <p>GE stock swung into a sharp recovery beginning in October. It has since climbed about 127% to 109.85 on June 30, its highest level since early 2018.</p>
      <p>The January spinoff of GE HealthCare Technologies boosted hopes of GE shares coming out of deal purgatory.</p>
      <p>Another big boost for GE stock came March 9 during an investor event in Cincinnati. Management forecast earnings would more than double in 2023. For aerospace, they guided revenue growth in the mid- to high teens, with margins reaching 20% by 2025 and expanding further in the long term.</p>
      <p>"We think we're going to have a very good year," GE CEO Larry Culp said.</p>
      <p>"Not unmindful of the fact that a lot of people are talking about recession, but we're talking about a high-growth year at GE, right?" he added.</p>
      <p>GE stock jumped 5% March 9. Shares turned actionable for growth investors over the past week, as the stock rebounded from its 10-week moving average. The rebound was weak, but a rise in volume would put GE squarely in the target zone.</p>
      <h3>Transformation Amid Catastrophe</h3>
      <p>In the first quarter, the GE aerospace business saw double-digit growth in orders, revenue and profits. Production of the new, fuel-efficient Leap engines leapt 53%. Shop visits climbed 32%. Air India selected 800 Leap engines to power its entire narrow-body fleet, the largest Leap order ever, GE said.</p>
      <p>Among blue chip stocks, GE's 68% rally year to date far outpaces those of other aerospace and defense stocks. Boeing stock is up roughly 11% over the same period, while Raytheon stock is down about 3%.</p>
      <p>Shares of GE had cratered in 2017-18 amid an earnings collapse, and analysts declared the industrial bellwether in crisis mode.</p>
      <p>Since Culp took over as CEO in 2018, GE has simplified its portfolio, continuing to shed businesses while working to slash the company's considerable debt. General Electric reported $134.6 billion in total borrowings at the end of 2018. By December 2022, that had been cut to $32.4 billion.</p>
      <p>Over this time, its prized aerospace business fought various fires: the Boeing 737 Max groundings, the 787 delivery halts, the sharp downturn in commercial air travel and severe supply disruptions due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
      <p>General Electric's transformation under these circumstances struck many as audacious. Especially since it still had earnings to deliver and expectations to meet as a public company.</p>
      <p>"It's like trying to change a car tire while the car is going down the highway at 55 miles an hour," RBC Capital's Dray told IBD.</p>
      <h3>China Flies On GE Aerospace Power</h3>
      <p>Now GE's aerospace business is poised for prime time.</p>
      <p>On the commercial side, the forthcoming GE Aerospace has seen travelers return to the skies, pushing global airlines to renew and expand their fleets.</p>
      <p>On the military side, aerospace is benefiting from rising U.S. and EU defense budgets amid the Russia-Ukraine war and China-Taiwan threat.</p>
      <p>Jet engines are extremely complex pieces of engineering. Few companies are better at producing this intricate equipment at scale than GE, said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar.</p>
      <p>To put things in context, Aguilar noted that Chinese companies like Comac have built aircraft "but they haven't been able to successfully build a commercial engine." A Leap engine powers the new Comac C919, China's first domestically made passenger plane.</p>
      <h3>Challenges Faced By GE Aerospace</h3>
      <p>Yet investors awaiting the arrival of GE Aerospace should expect some turbulence. Top among concerns, GE must meet the approaching deadline to separate its aerospace business from its energy business, GE Vernova.</p>
      <p>Analysts see a bit of deal limbo still in GE stock as investors worry about hitches in the early 2024 decoupling, Aguilar says. (General Electric says the separation remains on track.)</p>
      <p>Another concern is that industrial supply chains are still recovering from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>Jet-engine makers face persistent shortages of labor, parts and raw materials. In just one example, General Electric sent 12 of its machinists from Vermont to Arizona to help out a supplier.</p>
      <p>And while Culp has successfully refocused on aviation, that move is not without risk. The business is highly cyclical. Higher interest rates and an economic slowdown could force airline customers to delay or cancel orders.</p>
      <p>One concern, Morningstar analyst Aguilar says, is that the new GE won't have the medium-cycle businesses it once did "to offset long exposure in aviation." In addition, the company will still hold some legacy insurance liabilities.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, manufacturing, safety and other issues have delayed jet deliveries to end-users despite strong demand. Those issues have included durability issues with General Electric's Leap and RTX's geared-turbofan engines, which power Boeing and Airbus jets.</p>
      <p>While the companies signal progress on those issues, analysts are focused on actual deliveries. One analyst dismissed rising jet and jet-engine orders during the recent Paris Air Show as "all but irrelevant" given delays in delivering jets already sold.</p>
      <p>More broadly, aviation companies face risk from the spread of disease, as the coronavirus pandemic sharply brought home to investors. They are also vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, including the growing hostility between China and Taiwan. And all commercial U.S. and Western European flights were barred from Russian destinations or airspace shortly after Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p>
      <h3>Other Blue Chip Aerospace & Defense Stocks</h3>
      <p>How does the GE aerospace business stack up against competitors?</p>
      <p>GE's commercial aviation franchise is especially strong, competing in several markets that are virtual duopolies.</p>
      <p>It goes up against Pratt & Whitney, a division of Raytheon, in the market for narrow-body jets — the fuel-efficient designs that led the pandemic recovery. The Leap engine, made by a GE joint venture, powers the Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320/A321neo narrowbodies.</p>
      <p>In the widebody market, GE challenges the U.K.'s Rolls-Royce. Its GEnx engine powers the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and its next-gen GE9X is powering the Boeing 777X.</p>
      <p>For investors, the looming GE Aerospace promises focused exposure to the commercial aviation recovery.</p>
      <p>"Compared to Boeing and Raytheon, GE Aerospace is arguably the highest-quality asset," analysts at Melius Research said in an April note.</p>
      <p>GE Aerospace gets a higher (71%) share of its sales from the commercial end market than Raytheon (41%) and Boeing (53%), the analysts said, while enjoying the highest profit margins. RTX also has little exposure to the widebody market, which is expected to drive the next phase of commercial recovery.</p>
      <p>Jet engines are often sold for a loss. But a company like GE "would make eight times the revenue servicing that jet engine at significantly higher profitability over its 30- or 40-year economic life, tied to takeoffs and landings," Dray said.</p>
      <p>On the defense side as well, GE competes with Raytheon and Rolls-Royce to make engines for military jets.</p>
      <p>General Electric also has a smaller avionics business, involving things like control and display units. Rivals include Honeywell and RTX's Collins Aerospace unit.</p>
      <h3>Mergers, Other Opportunities For GE Stock</h3>
      <p>Opportunities for GE Aerospace include a merger with Honeywell's aerospace business, analysts say.</p>
      <p>Honeywell is a leading player in avionics and auxiliary power units. GE focuses mainly on jet engines. Their combined assets would span multiple offerings and "compete really well with the Raytheons of the world," Aguilar told IBD.</p>
      <p>The companies previously tried, and failed, to merge in 2001. Speculation about their merger continues, with antitrust regulators likely to remain a hurdle.</p>
      <p>Other opportunities reside in the technologies being developed for next-generation jets.</p>
      <p>Those include the CFM RISE, which uses "open fan" architecture (meaning no engine covering) and aims to be 20% more fuel efficient than current-gen Leap engines.</p>
      <p>Hybrid-electric powertrains and alternative fuels, like hydrogen, are also in the works.</p>
      <p>In the defense market, the battle to build the next-gen engines for F-35 jets could be a huge opportunity. The F-35 is called the most expensive U.S. weapons systems program ever. It is expected to cost nearly $1.7 trillion over its lifetime, so the stakes are high.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Air Force is exploring options. GE Aerospace has put forth its XA100 technology. Pratt, the incumbent engine supplier, is pushing for an upgrade program to the existing engines, while also offering a new power plant design.</p>
      <p>The XA100 could make it on the next, sixth-gen F-35s, some analysts say. Its "adaptive cycle" engine allows stealth fighters to switch between high thrust mode for maximum performance and high efficiency mode for maximum range, GE says.</p>
      <p>Aguilar called the XA100 a "phenomenal" piece of technology.</p>
      <p>Last summer, GE Aviation changed its name to GE Aerospace, a move designed to highlight its role beyond commercial engines. It may also hint at ambitions up in space, the Morningstar analyst said.</p>
      <h3>GE Vernova: A Tougher Spinoff</h3>
      <p>In the countdown to GE Aerospace, a big watch item is the energy business.</p>
      <p>General Electric boasts an installed base of 61,000 wind and gas turbines. But its energy business must try to get in the black before standing up on its own as GE Vernova. Profitability could affect the spinout timing.</p>
      <p>In Q1, GE's renewable energy unit lost $414 million on revenue of $2.8 billion, down 1%. The gas power unit managed a $75 million profit on revenue of $3.8 billion, up 9%. Margins slightly improved in both segments, though still a double-digit negative in renewables.</p>
      <p>Even General Electric CEO Culp expects the looming energy separation to be "a little tougher" vs. the GEHC health-care technologies spinoff in January.</p>
      <p>As management tries to put the energy business on the path to profitability, it faces more scrutiny around project selection and profit margins.</p>
      <p>"That is going to be the biggest story in GE stock over the next 12 months," Aguilar said.</p>
      <p>On June 23, rival Siemens Energy warned of a "substantial increase in failure rates of wind turbine components" and withdrew 2023 guidance. The read-through for GE Vernova is not yet clear.</p>

        <li>The current bull market in stocks looks sustainable as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't mess things up.</li>
        <li>Ned Davis Research said on Wednesday that a Fed-induced recession is the most likely risk that could derail stocks.</li>
        <li>"If the Fed panics and cuts rates, a blow-off bubble peak would be possible," NDR said.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>A policy mistake from the Federal Reserve is the biggest risk that could cut short the current bull market in stocks, according to a Wednesday note from Ned Davis Research.</p>
    	<p>The firm highlighted that the S&P 500's 25% rally from its mid-October low has all the hallmarks of a long-term secular bull market rather than a short-term cyclical bull market. But that can change pretty quickly if the Fed misfires on its interest rate policy.</p>	
    	<p>"Short cyclical bulls tend to occur during secular bear markets and coming out of recessions. Neither describe the current backdrop. Brief bulls have also been caused by extraordinary events like an inflation resurgence or bubble blow-off top. This cycle's catalyst is more likely to be a Fed-induced recession," NDR said.</p>	
    	<p>The firm said what's helping sustain the current bull rally is the fact that stocks have been in a secular bull market since 2009, and while it might be closer to the end than the beginning, it's too soon to say that a secular bear market has begun.</p>
      <p>"The secular backdrop does not support the brief cyclical bull case," NDR said.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the resilient economy since the COVID-19 pandemic means that 2022's bear market decline in stocks occurred absent a recession. That fact favors the idea that the current bull market in stocks is more secular in nature than cyclical, according to the note.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Fed represents the biggest risk to the stock market, which is the case whether the Fed cuts or continues to raise interest rates.</p>
      <p>Highlighting an example of how a policy mistake can come regardless of the direction of rates, NDR pointed out that the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 sparked a brief bear market in stocks and led Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates three times. Stocks took off after that, leading to a bubble.</p>
      <p>"The current surge in FANMAG and AI stocks has not been nearly as great as [technology, media, and telecom] stocks in 1999. But if the Fed panics and cuts rates, a blow-off bubble peak would be possible," NDR said.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, if inflation lingers and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell aggressively hikes interest rates again, he could plunge the economy into a recession and effectively end the bull market.</p>
      <p>"A Volcker-type early 1980s recession would seem more likely than a Burns/Miller policy mistake, but an external shock could trigger a resurgence in inflation beyond the Fed's control," NDR said.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, a lot has to go right for the bull market to be sustainable and long-lasting, and much of that hinges on the Fed finding the sweet spot for interest rates that enables continued economic growth but also keeps inflation at bay.</p>
      <p>With interest rates sitting at more than 5%, all eyes will be on the Fed's next interest rate decision at its July FOMC meeting.</p>

    	<p>Fidelity Investments is converting six mutual funds holding $13.5 billion in assets into exchange-traded funds, a quantum leap from its previous transition, as the move toward the more flexible exchange-traded format accelerates.</p>
    	<p>Boston-based Fidelity, which manages $4.2 trillion and is the world’s fourth biggest asset manager, is converting a batch of actively managed funds, which charge higher fees and are growing in popularity as investors seek returns that beat broad markets.</p>	
    	<p>Fidelity converted $427 million into ETFs this month under a plan announced in November, and this latest $13.5 billion batch represents a massive expansion of its strategy. ETFs are widely seen as having liquidity, tradability and tax advantages over mutual funds, and have been adding assets while mutual funds are shedding them.</p>	
    	<p>“Conversions represent one option for traditional mutual fund managers to enter the faster growing ETF space,” CFRA’s Head of ETF Data and Analytics Aniket Ullal told etf.com in an email. “While conversions will accelerate the growth of ETFs at the expense of traditional mutual funds, the latter will continue to be important in areas such as defined contribution plans, where traditional funds are still dominant.”</p>
      <p>Around $71 billion in mutual funds have switched over into exchange-traded funds since the first was done in 2021, Ullal said. That total may swell to $1 trillion over the next decade or so, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has estimated. Asset managers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Dimensional ETFs are among companies that have swapped mutual funds into ETFs.</p>
      <h3>Active Management</h3>
      <p>Fidelity, with $35.9 billion held in 58 U.S.-traded ETFs, is also aiming at the rapidly growing actively managed field. Actively managed ETF inflows surged 45% in May to $8.4 billion, according to Morningstar. Flows into active funds made up about a quarter of all May ETF inflows, despite the category comprising about 5% of total exchange-traded fund assets.</p>
      <p>Fidelity will convert the following mutual funds, according to a filing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>International Enhanced Index Fund (FIENX) will become Enhanced International ETF</li>
        <li>Large Cap Core Enhanced Index Fund (FLCEX) will become Enhanced Large Cap Core ETF</li>
        <li>Large Cap Growth Enhanced Index Fund (FLGEX) will become Enhanced Large Cap Growth ETF</li>
        <li>Large Cap Value Enhanced Index Fund (FLVEX) will become Enhanced Large Cap Value ETF</li>
        <li>Mid Cap Enhanced Index Fund (FMEIX) will become Enhanced Mid Cap ETF</li>
        <li>Small Cap Enhanced Index Fund (FCPEX) will become Enhanced Small Cap ETF.</li>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is known for investing in disruptive innovation. The super investor has placed big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely regarded as one of the most disruptive and transformative technologies today.</p>
    	<p>Speaking of AI stocks, it's hard to ignore what Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been doing. Shares of the chipmaking giant have surged 187% so far this year, and the company crossed $1 trillion in valuation.</p>	
    	<p>Ark Invest's flagship fund Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) exited its position in Nvidia in January, but some of its other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) still have positions in the chipmaker.</p>	
    	<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood said that Nvidia "will do well over time." But she sees a new group of stocks that will "benefit from the foundation that Nvidia has laid."</p>
      <p>The keyword is software.</p>
      <p>"In our view, for every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers, SaaS [software as a service] providers will generate $8 in revenue," she said. "So we are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it."</p>
      <p>The super investor then named three software companies she believes will thrive because of AI. Here's a look at the trio and another company she calls "the biggest artificial intelligence play."</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH)</h3>
      <p>UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.</p>
      <p>In the first quarter of 2023, the company's revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.</p>
      <p>The stock has surged 36% year to date, but it hasn't always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.</p>
      <p>Wood's Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,363,938 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at  $486.73 million, UiPath is the fifth-largest holding at Ark.</p>
      <h3>Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO)</h3>
      <p>Twilio's cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.</p>
      <p>In the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.</p>
      <p>In its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence "will be a material accelerant over time for Twilio's business."</p>
      <p>Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,771,968 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $304.50 million.</p>
      <h3>Teladoc Health Inc. (NYSE:TDOC)</h3>
      <p>Wood's flagship fund also owns $300.43 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.</p>
      <p>The company's platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.</p>
      <p>At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.</p>
      <p>While the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc's first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.</p>
      <p>The stock, however, wasn't able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $25.80 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.</p>
      <h3>‘The Biggest Artificial Intelligence Play'</h3>
      <p>Wood's biggest bet in the AI arena is a company that isn't known for being an AI stock — Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).</p>
      <p>"We talk about Tesla all the time, it actually is the biggest artificial intelligence play," she said.</p>
      <p>The reason has to do with the electric car company's autonomous driving technology.</p>
      <p>Tesla is ARKK's largest holding with an 11.59% weighting.</p>
      <p>Wood expects autonomous taxi platforms to deliver $8 trillion to $10 trillion in revenue globally in 2030 "from almost zero right now."</p>
      <p>And because of Tesla's capabilities on that front, the booming autonomous taxi market could take its share price to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>"We believe that in five years, 2027, it will be a $2,000 stock if our research is correct," she said.</p>
      <p>Considering that Tesla shares trade at around $257 right now, Wood's price target implies a potential upside of over 670%.</p>
      <p>Investing in disruptive innovation can be very lucrative — but sometimes it can feel like a roller coaster. For instance, while Tesla shares have more than doubled year to date, they are still down over 30% from their peak in November 2021.</p>
      <p>If you don't like that kind of uncertainty, you might want to look into slow-changing industries that provide considerable cash returns to investors — such as those catering to basic human needs like food and shelter. For those seeking to generate passive income without the volatility associated with publicly traded stocks, there are avenues to invest in these essential service businesses through the private market.</p>

    	<p>Wall Street ended sharply higher on Tuesday, pulled up by tech stocks. Investor mood was upbeat on the release of a slew of economic data, reflecting a strong economy and allaying fears of a recession. All three major indexes ended in the green.</p>
      <h3>How Did the Benchmarks Perform?</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.6% or 212.03 points to close at 33,926.74. Twenty-three components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while seven ended in negative.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 gained 1.2%, or 49.59 points to close at 4,378.41. Ten of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index ended in positive territory. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) advanced 2.2%, 2% and 1.7%, respectively, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) slid 0.2%.</p>	
    	<p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 219.90 points, or 1.7%, to finish at 13,555.67.</p>
      <p>The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 3.6% at 13.74. A total of 10.2 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.6 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.55-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.54-1 ratio favored the advancing issues.</p>
      <h3>Economic Data Lifts Investor Mood</h3>
      <p>The U.S. benchmark stock indexes rebounded from their recent losing trend and had a winning Tuesday, mainly driven by economic data. Numbers showed that the economy remains reslilient. Investor activity reflected that there was too much talk about an impending recession even as various sectors continued to return robust numbers.</p>
      <p>Risk remains, however, that if these numbers persist, the Fed would re-emabark on its policy-tightening path. According to CME Group's Fedwatch tool, market participants were pricing in a 77% chance that the central bank will raise interest rates by 25 bps to the 5.25-5.50% range in its July meeting. Nonetheless, this slew of economic data comes in an apt time to lift investor mood.</p>
      <p>The Conference Board reported that the consumer confidence index rose to 109.7 in June, its highest level since January 2022, from 102.5 in May. The May number was revised from 102.3.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development jointly reported that new home sales had come in at 763,000 for May, 12.2% up from the revised April figure of 680,000. The April number was revised down from 683,000.</p>
      <p>Case-Shiller Home Prices showed a 1% month-over-month increase for the 10-City Composite, and a 0.9% increase for the 20-City Composite for the month of April.</p>
      <p>Per a government report, durable orders for May increased 1.7% after increasing 1.2% in April. The April figure was revised up from 1.1%.</p>
      <p>Riding on these, the Dow Jones Industrial Average turned green for the first time in seven sessions. The biggest impact this slew of robust economic data had in the session, however, was on mega-cap growth and tech stocks, which drove the spoils of the day.</p>
      <p>Consequently, shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL increased 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p>

    	<p>BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday after leaders of major central banks said they need to keep interest rates high to fight persistent inflation despite fears that might tip the global economy into recession.</p>
    	<p>Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul retreated while Tokyo and Sydney advanced. Oil prices declined.</p>	
    	<p>U.S., European and Japanese central bankers meeting in Portugal said Wednesday that with hiring still strong in major economies, they have yet to extinguish upward pressure on prices. “Policy hasn’t been restrictive enough for long enough,” said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>	
    	<p>“The end of hiking interest rates is not in sight yet,” said Carl B. Weinberg of High-Frequency Economics in a report.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1% to 3,185.56 while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 0.4% to 33,340.66. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank 0.9% to 18,995.31.</p>
      <p>The Kospi in Seoul gave up 0.1% to 2,560.67 while Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 advanced less than 0.1% to 7,203.30. New Zealand advanced while Bangkok declined.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 edged down less than 0.1% to 4,376.86.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% to 33,852.66. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3% to 13,591.75.</p>
      <p>General Mills sank 5.2% after the maker of Cheerios and Haagen-Dazs reported weaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.</p>
      <p>Other food companies also fell, including drops of 4% for Hershey, 3.7% for J.M. Smucker and 3.5% for Conagra Brands.</p>
      <p>AeroVironment, maker of unmanned aircraft, tactical missile systems and other equipment used by the U.S. military and in Ukraine, rose 4.9% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected.</p>
      <p>Investors expect at least a brief recession this year after the Fed and central banks in Europe and Asia raised interest rates. But hiring and consumer spending have stayed unexpectedly strong, prompting suggestions a recession might be avoided.</p>
      <p>The Fed has said it expects to raise rates one or two more times this year, while the European Central Bank and others have sounded even more aggressive.</p>
      <p>Strong reports on U.S. consumer confidence, sales of new homes and other areas of the economy on Tuesday helped lead to a 1.1% rally for the S&P 500. This month, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since April 2022.</p>
      <p>In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 18 cents to $69.38 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $1.86 on Wednesday to $69.56. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, shed 26 cents to $73.98 per barrel in London. It gained $1.77 the previous session to $74.03.</p>
      <p>The dollar edged up to 144.35 yen from Wednesday's 144.32 yen. The euro fell to $1.0896 from $1.0922.</p>

      <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "While the market is pulling back, action remains constructive. Taking a breather now means the indexes can gather strength for further advances. Due to this, IBD continues to recommend 60% to 80% exposure. But this is a good opportunity to look over your portfolio and perhaps lock in some profits in your big winners."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column as the stock market remains in an uptrend but is pulling back.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: JPMorgan, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones banking leader JPMorgan is about 3% below a 143.37 flat-base buy point after Friday's 0.5% drop. Shares are right at their 50-day line. JPM stock rose 0.3% early Monday.</p>
      <p>Salesforce managed to steady itself after a post-earnings slump. It is now testing support at the 21-day exponential moving average. The megacap tech previously moved past a pair of alternative entries at 194.01 and at 200.10, according to IBD Leaderboard analysis.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry, and are now trying to bounce from support at the 10-week line. CRM stock moved down 0.4% Monday morning.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Chipotle, McKesson, MongoDB, Roku</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Chipotle is rebounding from its 10-week line and building a flat base with a 2,139.88 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. Chipotle was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day. CMG stock rose 0.2% Monday morning.</p>
      <p>IBD SwingTrader stock McKesson is in buy range past a 401.53 cup-with-handle entry. The 5% buy zone goes up to 421.61. Shares were up 0.3% Monday.</p>
      <p>MongoDB is trading tightly after its recent earnings-fueled gap up, offering a new entry. The three-weeks-tight formation shows a buy point at 398.89, while aggressive investors could use a trendline entry around 386. MDB stock fell 1.6% Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Streaming giant Roku is building a cup-with-handle base with a 75.45 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition, even as the stock extended a losing streak to seven sessions Friday. Roku shares are trying to halt their slide around their 50-day line, a key support level to watch. The stock fell 1% early Monday.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla skidded 3% Friday after a third analyst downgrade in as many days. Shares remains sharply extended above a double-bottom base's 207.79 buy point. They closed Friday 18% off their 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock threatened to add to Friday's losses, paring losses to just 0.1% Monday. Last week, shares snapped a five-week win streak, declining 1.5% on the week.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock hit an all-time high Friday before reversing 0.2% lower. Last week, shares traded as high as 187.56. The stock continues to hold well above a 157.38 buy point. Early Monday, AAPL stock was up 0.4%.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares slid 1.4% Friday, continuing a recent pullback. Last week, the stock hit a record high at 351.47. Despite the recent losses, MSFT stock remains in the 20% to 25% profit-taking zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors can take at least some profits. And on Monday morning, Microsoft shares were off 0.2%.</p>

    	<p>By Christoph Steitz</p>
    	<p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Siemens Energy shares fell for a second consecutive session on Monday, hit by a raft of target price cuts and rating downgrades in the wake of deeper-than-expected problems at its wind turbine division that emerged last week.</p>	
    	<p>It share price was down 3.3% at 1252 GMT, at the bottom of Germany's blue-chip DAX index, taking the group's loss in market valuation to 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion) since it scrapped its profit outlook late on Thursday.</p>	
    	<p>"We are now waiting for the full results of the analysis before drawing any further conclusions," a spokesperson for the company said in response to a query from Reuters.</p>
      <p>Citi cut the company to "neutral" from "buy" while Jefferies downgraded to "hold" from "buy", following the group's withdrawal of its 2023 profit guidance and the more than 1 billion euros it says it will cost to fix the issues.</p>
      <p>"After the warning, while the stock is now over one-third cheaper, investor confidence in the turnaround has been severely impacted, not just because of difficult-to-quantify risks around fixing past deliveries, but also because of the lack of visibility at (Siemens Gamesa)," Citi analysts wrote.</p>
      <p>They said depending on whether reliability issues could be contained or not, a price per share of anywhere between 11 and 34 euros was possible, adding it was key what Siemens Energy would say during third-quarter results on Aug. 7.</p>
      <p>Its shares on Monday traded around 14 euros apiece, the lowest level in seven and a half months.</p>
      <p>Siemens Energy was forced to publish a brief ad hoc statement late on Thursday based on limited information, withdrawing its profit outlook after it became apparent that the issues would incur costs of more than 1 billion euros.</p>
      <p>($1 = 0.9162 euros)</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Germany’s central bank may need a bailout to cover losses on the debt it hoovered up as part of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) massive bond-buying programme, the country’s federal auditor has warned.</p>
    	<p>The Bundesrechnungshof said losses faced by the Bundesbank on more than €650bn (£570bn) of bond purchases were “substantial” and “could necessitate a recapitalisation with budgetary funds”.</p>	
    	<p>The critical report of the ECB’s so-called public sector purchase programme (PSPP) – akin to quantitative easing in the UK and US – throws future bond-buying sprees to prop up the single currency bloc in doubt.</p>	
    	<p>Economists have blamed bond-buying programmes for stoking inflation amid a series of negative supply shocks that have increased the risk of economies overheating.</p>
      <p>Steep rate hikes by the ECB meant that the Bundesbank suffered a €1bn hit to its bond holdings last year alone.</p>
      <p>This is because the central bank is now paying more in interest to commercial banks on deposits at the Bundesbank than the interest it earns on its stockpile of bonds. The ECB started reducing the size of its balance sheet this spring.</p>
      <p>The losses are similar to those seen in the UK, where the Bank of England has estimated that transfers between the Treasury and the Bank will amount to around £30bn annually over the next three years alone.</p>
      <p>Unlike in Germany, losses on the Bank’s stockpile of bonds are automatically covered by the taxpayer under a deal struck by former Chancellor Alistair Darling to indemnify the Bank when bond-buying during the financial crisis.</p>
      <p>Joachim Nagel, president of Germany’s central bank, warned back in March that the “burdens on the Bundesbank’s profit and loss account are likely to increase considerably in the years to come”.</p>
      <p>He noted that the Bundesbank’s €19.2bn war chest of provisions was likely to be wiped out in future years. The Bundesbank also has a separate emergency fund of €2.5bn it can tap into if needed.</p>
      <p>Mr Nagel said that while its buffers would be sufficient to cover losses this year, he warned that in subsequent years, “the burdens will probably exceed our financial buffers”.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the Financial Times, which first reported the auditor’s warning, the German finance ministry said it had a “different assessment” to the federal auditor of the risks to the budget arising from the Bundesbank’s actions. It insisted that it was “highly unlikely” that losses from the Bundesbank’s monetary policy operations would “put a strain on the federal budget”.</p>
      <p>Mr Nagel has also noted that he expects losses to be carried forward on the Bundesbank’s balance sheet, and covered by future profits over “the course of time – as was already done in the 1970s”.</p>
      <p>He added: “The Bundesbank’s balance sheet is sound.”</p>
      <p>It came as a separate survey suggested Germany risks staying mired in recession this year after a closely-watched barometer of business activity slumped in June.</p>
      <p>The closely-watched Ifo business climate index fell to 88.5 in June following May’s reading of 91.5, led by a “substantial” decline in manufacturing. This is the lowest reading since November 2022, coming in the wake of a surge in energy costs, and is well below analysts’ expectations for a fall to 90.7.</p>
      <p>All sectors of the German economy suffered a decline, according to the survey, which noted that in manufacturing “the business climate deteriorated substantially”. It added: “Hardly any industry has been left untouched by this development.”</p>
      <p>Carsten Brzeski at ING said the collapse in activity suggested that “the rebound of the German economy has ended before it ever really began”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Today’s disappointing Ifo index reading suggests that the hoped-for rebound of the German economy is nothing more than hope. Optimism is fading and the economy faces new growth concerns.</p>
      <p>We are not saying that the economy will be stuck in recession for the next couple of years, but with several short and long-term challenges, growth will remain subdued at best.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Amazon (AMZN) is set to hit a major milestone in 2024: Becoming the largest retailer in the US, according to JPMorgan analysts Doug Anmuth and Bryan M. Smilek.</p>
    	<p>If this comes to pass, Amazon will be unseating Walmart (WMT) as the country's largest retailer. It would be a seismic shift, one driven by increased e-commerce penetration, faster delivery times, and the stickiness of Amazon Prime.</p>	
    	<p>JPMorgan estimates show that, in 2023, Amazon's gross merchandise volume, or GMV, will grow 11.6% year-over-over to $477 billion.</p>	
    	<p>This kind of growth shows the sort of resilience that Wall Street has been hoping to see out of e-commerce businesses, which had a tough 2022. Though e-commerce businesses like Amazon saw major booms during the pandemic, last year saw a pullback.</p>
      <p>It was the first year since 2009 that US e-commerce grew less than 10%, the analysts noted, adding just 8.5% year-over-year, "likely driven by macro pressures, the resurgence of [brick-and-mortar] retailers, and the shift toward omnichannel retail following the pandemic," Anmuth and Smilek wrote on June 20.</p>
      <p>This year, Amazon's GMV is growing due to "solid growth in under-penetrated categories" like grocery and apparel, "faster delivery speeds, with 2023 tracking toward Amazon’s fastest delivery speeds ever," and the "Prime flywheel," the idea that the company's much-discussed subscription service builds momentum at every step in the experience, the analysts wrote.</p>
      <p>Amazon's e-commerce business will also benefit from increased business-to-business capabilities, new fintech offerings like Buy With Prime, and estimated growth in the number of third-party sellers operating in the company's marketplace, they added.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan estimates that there will be about 300 million Prime members globally by the end of this year. In 2021, then-CEO Jeff Bezos said the company had "more than 200 million Prime members worldwide."</p>
      <p>Amazon also has a massive grip on the e-commerce marketplace and, at the end of 2023, JPMorgan analysts expect the company's e-commerce market share to be 42.2%, an increase of 106 basis points year-over-year.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan's bullishness on Amazon also ties back to the belief that the company will leverage generative AI in its e-commerce operations, suggesting that a "ChatGPT-style product search would create an interactive conversational experience" which the analysts believe would "enable Amazon other retailers to provide a more personalized customer experience" and that AI could also "could enable Amazon and other retailers to leverage a breadth of customer purchase history and data and enhance personalized recommendations."</p>
      <h3>Big tech government scrutiny</h3>
      <p>There's a catch, however: in recent months, so-called "big tech" companies, Amazon included, are seeing increased scrutiny from the federal government. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said he is investigating what he called Amazon's "abysmal safety record" and, though it's far from the first time Sanders has gone after Amazon, it's certainly one of the most formal, and is unlikely to be the last.</p>
      <p>Additionally, last week the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Amazon, alleging that the company has been tricking customers into signing up for Amazon Prime and making it harder to cancel those subscriptions.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit is the byproduct of an FTC investigation that began back in 2021. For Amazon, it's a gut-punch of a lawsuit, alleging that the company violated several consumer protection laws and that the court should issue an injunction to stop Amazon's Prime subscription practices.</p>
      <p>This new Amazon lawsuit comes on the heels of FTC actions against many of tech's biggest names, including Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Apple (APPL).</p>

        <li>Shares could jump 37% from current levels to $254 by the end of 2024.</li>
        <li>"The uptrend [in Apple] shows no counter-trend signals yet," Fairlead Strategies said.</li>
      </ul>
	    <p>Apple stock decisively confirmed its breakout to new record highs on Friday, and that could pave the way for more upside into 2024, according to a Friday note from Fairlead Strategies.</p>
	    <p>The firm highlighted that with Apple stock trading at $187 Friday afternoon, the stock is poised to close above its prior resistance level of $183 for the second week in a row, confirming a decisive breakout.</p>	
	    <p>This "bullish long-term development" generates a new price objective of $254 per share for Apple, representing potential upside of 37% from current levels. A rise to that level would give the iPhone maker a market valuation of about $4 trillion based on today's current shares outstanding of 15.79 billion.</p>	
	    <p>"The breakout yields a measured move objective of about $254 using the Covid/2020 corrective low as a point of reference," Fairlead Strategies' founder Katie Stockton told Insider on Friday. "The 'measured move' assumes that the uptrend that preceded the 2021-2022 trading range has resumed."</p>
      <p>Stockton identified the end of 2024 as the timeframe for the technical price objective to be reached, and noted that the stock's uptrend looks poised to continue in the short term.</p>
      <p>"The uptrend shows no counter-trend signals yet. When a pullback develops, initial support is at the rising 20-day moving average... although a pullback does not appear imminent," she said. The 20-day moving average for Apple stock is currently around $181 per share.</p>
      <p>Apple stock has surged 44% so far in 2023 and has driven the bulk of the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of about 14%. The company recently announced its first product in the AR/VR market, the Apple Vision headset, which will sell for $3,499 when it is released early next year.</p>
      <p>Apple's current valuation is about $2.96 trillion, and it's set to cross the $3 trillion threshold if the stock price hits $190.73, which is just over $3 away from current levels.</p>

    	<p>Tesla stock was downgraded by Morgan Stanley Thursday. This comes after Barclays did the same Wednesday morning, giving TSLA an equal weight rating.</p>
    	<p>For the second time in as many days, Tesla (TSLA) stock received a downgrade Thursday, as analysts expect waning consumer demand and increased competition in China to cut into Tesla's value. The stock edged up Thursday after swooning around 5.5% Wednesday.</p>	
    	<p>Morgan Stanley downgraded Tesla to equal weight, from overweight, Thursday and hiked its share price target to 250, up from 200 and about 3% below where shares closed on Wednesday. This comes after a Barclays downgrade on Wednesday.</p>	
    	<p>The Barclay's note wrote cited Tesla as an artificial intelligence (A.I.) beneficiary as well as an auto company. Morgan Stanley's view is that high expectations on A.I. have brought Tesla stock to a fair valuation.</p>
      <p>"We're not trying to call 'the end' to the Tesla rally," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas made clear on Thursday. "And from our discussions (we) continue to find a significant degree of investor skepticism/lack of exposure around the name."</p>
      <p>Jonas added that despite the downgrade, Morgan Stanley views Tesla as a "must own" in an EV portfolio and as an industrial "standard-bearer" for electric transport and renewable energy economy.</p>
      <p>"Despite the recent rally, we expect material negative revisions for Tesla consensus earnings forecasts," Jonas told investors.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley forecasts "intensifying competition" from China's EV players and slowing auto demand from consumers both present growing risks for Tesla stock. Jonas sees Tesla stock in a bull case hitting 450 and in a bear case 90, over the next 12 months.</p>
      <h3>Tesla (TSLA)</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock dropped nearly before edging up around 2% to 264.46 Thursday during market trade. Tesla stock slumped 5.4% to 259.46 Wednesday. On Tuesday, shares jumped 5.3% to 274.31.</p>
      <p>Wednesday morning, Barclays analyst Dan Levy also downgraded Tesla stock to equal weight, down from overweight. Levy hiked the firm's TSLA price target to 260, up from the previous 220.</p>
      <p>The Barclays analyst wrote the stock's recent rally has been "too sharp relative to challenging near-term fundamentals." Levy told investors questions about margins and demand for Tesla vehicles remain concerns.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>TSLA has advanced around 30% in June. Last week, the stock jumped more than 6% despite two straight consecutive sessions with losses.</p>
      <p>Before shares slipped last Wednesday, Tesla enjoyed a run of 13 straight gains. Shares are up around 140% since Jan. 3. However, Tesla is down around 36% from the all-time high 414 it hit in November 2021.</p>
      <p>Tesla is well extended past a 207.79 buy point from what's either a cup or a double-bottom base.</p>
      <p>Shares are more than 30% above their 200-day/40-week moving average. That's the most extended they've been since the stock marked its peak in November 2021.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock ranks third in IBD's automaker industry group. It has a 99 Composite Rating out of 99. Tesla has a 90 Relative Strength Rating and its EPS Rating is 93 out of 99.</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed higher on Thursday as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continued to beat a hawkish drum and suggested the central bank has not reached the end of its tightening cycle, but provided reassurance that the Fed would proceed with caution.</p>	
	    <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq's robust gain got a boost from momentum stocks led by Amazon.com Apple Inc, and Microsoft Corp, while the S&P 500's advance was more modest.</p>	
	    <p>Industrials and financials held the blue-chip Dow essentially flat.</p>
      <p>"Investors are playing tug of war, as if they're pulling petals from a daisy saying 'bull market, not a bull market,'" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. "We don’t have much to trade on, second-quarter earnings don’t start in a couple weeks yet."</p>
      <p>Powell, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee for his semi-annual monetary policy testimony reiterated his view that more interest rate hikes are likely in the months ahead, a sentiment echoed by Fed Governor Michelle Bowman earlier in the session.</p>
      <p>"The market believes the Fed will raise rates one more time, not two more times as implied by the post FOMC meeting summary," Stovall added. "In addition, yesterday and today’s, Powell reiterated that they will be data dependent and Wall Street expects inflation to cool faster, and unemployment will start to creep higher which is what the Fed has intended with its rate increases."</p>
      <p>Investors were taken by surprise when the Bank of England implemented a larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate hike to tackle Britain's stubborn inflation, further evidence that hot price growth remains a global economic headwind.</p>
      <p>At last glance, financial markets have priced in a 77% probability of another 25 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of the Fed's July meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>On the economic front, jobless claims held steady at a 20-month high and the Conference Board's Leading Economic index posted its 14th consecutive monthly decline, suggesting that the Fed's efforts to dampen the economy are beginning to have their intended effect.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.81 points, or 0.01%, to 33,946.71, the S&P 500 gained 16.2 points, or 0.37%, to 4,381.89 and the Nasdaq Composite added 128.41 points, or 0.95%, to 13,630.61.</p>
      <p>Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, five ended the session higher, with consumer discretionary enjoying the largest percentage advance.</p>
      <p>Real estate and energy posted the biggest declines.</p>
      <p>Spirit AeroSystems tumbled 9.4% after the aircraft parts supplier announced it would suspend production at its plant in Wichita, Kansas, after workers announced a strike from June 24.</p>
      <p>Boeing shares dropped 3.1%.</p>
      <p>U.S.-listed shares of Accenture fell 1.9% after the IT consulting firm forecast weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue.</p>
      <p>Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants issued a disappointing annual profit outlook due to ballooning commodities prices. Its shares slid 2.6%.</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 118 new lows.</p>
      <p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.60 billion shares, compared with the 11.37 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.</p>

    	<p>BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares sank sharply Friday after several central banks around the world cranked interest rates higher in their fight against inflation.</p>
    	<p>Hong Kong and Tokyo shed nearly 2% and most other regional markets declined. U.S. futures and oil prices also were lower.</p>	
    	<p>Japan reported its inflation rate was higher than expected, adding to expectations the central bank might adjust its policies to reflect upward price pressures, which have pushed the dollar's value against the yen sharply higher.</p>	
    	<p>The Bank of Japan has kept its benchmark interest rate at minus 0.1% for a decade as policymakers keep credit cheap to encourage more investment and spending.</p>
      <p>The core inflation rate, excluding volatile energy and food prices, was 3.2% in May, above the official 2% target, the government reported.</p>
      <p>“We think there are signs of inflationary pressure building up on the supply side, but it is certainly not strong enough for the BOJ to bring about immediate tightening,” ING Economics said in a commentary.</p>
      <p>The dollar was trading at 143.11 yen up from 143.10 yen, near its highest level since November. A weaker Japanese yen raises costs for Japanese businesses and consumers given the country's heavy reliance on imports.</p>
      <p>Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was down 1.8% at 32,654.37 by midday and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 1.9% to 18,845.04.</p>
      <p>In Seoul, the Kospi fell 0.8% to 2,572.33, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gave up 1.2% to 7,110.40. Markets in mainland China were closed for a holiday. Shares also fell in Mumbai and Bangkok.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 4,381.89, even though the majority of stocks fell. A rebound for technology stocks helped to overshadow losses elsewhere in the market and keep the benchmark index afloat.</p>
      <p>Gains for high-growth stocks also drove the Nasdaq composite to a market-leading gain of 1%, to 13,630.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell less than 0.1% to 33,946.71.</p>
      <p>The Bank of England hiked its main interest rate by a bigger margin than expected to a 15-year high. Central banks in Norway, Switzerland and Turkey also raised borrowing rates.</p>
      <p>Stock indexes in Europe fell following the most recent rate increases. Britain’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.8%. The latest interest rate increase from the Bank of England marked its 13th hike in a row in its effort to combat stubbornly high inflation.</p>
      <p>In the United States, meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his belief that inflation is still too high and that further increases to rates may be necessary. Powell testified before a Senate committee Thursday, a day after appearing before a House of Representatives committee.</p>
      <p>The Fed held interest rates steady at its last meeting after raising rates aggressively throughout 2022 and into 2023 to tame painfully high inflation. Inflation has cooled somewhat since last summer, but the Fed has signaled it may raise rates two more times this year as it tries to push inflation down to its stated goal of 2%.</p>
      <p>Central banks worldwide have been raising interest rates to make borrowing more costly and slow economic growth to stifle inflation. But the strategy risks going too far in stalling growth and dragging economies into a recession.</p>
      <p>In Asia, central banks have begun to keep interest rates steady, or in the case of Vietnam, cut them, as their economies have slowed.</p>
      <p>High interest rates have already slowed manufacturing and other parts of the U.S. economy. They've also helped cause three high-profile failures in the U.S. banking system. The banking industry remains under pressure, even after the federal government acted quickly to provide support.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits remained elevated last week, a possible sign that the Fed’s rate hikes are beginning to cool a surprisingly resilient labor market.</p>
      <p>In the housing industry, sales of previously occupied homes strengthened last month to top economists’ expectations for a slide.</p>
      <p>In other trading Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 96 cents to $68.55 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up $3.02 to $69.51 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Brent crude, the international standard, lost 96 cents to $73.39 per barrel.</p>
      <p>The euro was trading at $1.0933, down from $1.0960.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Treasuries dropped in Asia as they reopened following a US long weekend, extending a global slide that began in the UK where investors grew concerned stubborn inflation will lead to more aggressive monetary tightening.</p>
    	<p>US 10-year yields rose three basis points, after similar-maturity UK yields jumped eight basis points to their highest since September.</p>	
    	<p>Traders are betting the average central bank rate in developed markets will rise to 3.82% in a year, the highest forecast since early March. That means they have effectively priced out bets the financial-market stress that erupted with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will persuade policymakers to stop tightening.</p>
      <p>Gilts led declines in government debt Monday before UK inflation data due Wednesday and a Bank of England policy decision the following day. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to testify to Congress Wednesday, and his comments may put further weight on global bonds after the latest central bank decisions in Australia, Canada and the US were all more hawkish than anticipated.</p>
      <p>“There is no question the momentum has shifted, with US yields climbing even after the Fed paused and University of Michigan inflation expectations dropped,” said Prashant Newnaha, a rates strategist at TD Securities Inc. in Singapore. “The prospect that the BOE and ECB will need to do more to get on top of inflation puts pressure on bonds globally.”</p>
      <h3>Buying on Dips</h3>
    	<p>Even as markets price in higher global central bank rates, some investors are looking to buy bonds on a bet most of the policy tightening is already over.</p>
      <p>“I have been adding,” said Amy Xie Patrick, head of income strategies at Pendal Group Ltd. in Sydney. “Bonds put in their best innings in the pause after the hiking cycle. It doesn’t matter much whether we’re zero or three hikes away from the end, the bulk of the hiking cycle is behind us, and the lagged effect of previous hikes will bite down harder with the passing of time.”</p>
      <p>Australia’s bonds pared losses after minutes of this month’s central-bank meeting showed the surprise rate hike was a “finely balanced decision.” The nation’s 10-year yield was two basis points higher at 3.99%, after rising to a year-to-date high of 4.05% before the minutes were published.</p>
      <p>Global government bonds have lost about 2% over the past three months, paring this year’s gain to about 1%, according to a Bloomberg index. Markets had expected central banks would respond to signs price pressures are easing by softening their stance, whereas policymakers instead remained aggressive on concerns inflation remain is in danger of remaining above their targets for too long.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Stocks declined Tuesday as the second-quarter rally met resistance from economic headwinds and signs that positioning is overbought.</p>
    	<p>European stocks slipped for a second day as worries about the Chinese economy curbed risk appetite. Specialty chemicals company Lanxess AG fell 11% on a profit warning. US contracts declined after Wall Street was shut for a holiday Monday.</p>	
    	<p>Investors caught between fear of missing out on the second-quarter rally and concerns it has run too far, too fast are contending with overblown valuations and economic headwinds.</p>	
    	<p>Bullish positioning in US equity futures grew last week, taking it to the most extended levels for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 in data going back to 2010, according to Citigroup strategists.</p>
      <p>“Given our fundamental view on growth, we find it hard to get on board with the current excitement and narrative” according to Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson.</p>
      <p>The path of US monetary policy is another wildcard. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give his semi-annual report to Congress on Wednesday. Policymakers at the Fed kept interest rates unchanged at their latest meeting but warned of more tightening ahead.</p>
      <p>The Fed decision last week came with forecasts for higher borrowing costs of 5.6% in 2023, implying two additional quarter-point rate hikes or one half-point increase before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in markets, US Treasury yields rose after the break from trading Monday. Oil fell as China’s plans to support its economy were seen as insufficient to reignite demand.</p>
      <p>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. whipsawed before trading about 1.5% lower Tuesday following the surprise replacement of its chief executive and chairman.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin’s market capitalization is once again larger than that of all other cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from TradingView.</p>
    	<p>The site’s BTC dominance metric rose above 50% on Monday for the first time since May 2021, when Bitcoin’s price plummeted after China announced a total ban on crypto mining, and Tesla partly distanced itself from the asset over environmental concerns.</p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin dominance last neared the 50% mark in June 2022 as the entire crypto market cratered on news of persistently high inflation in the United States, leading to aggressive monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve.</p>	
    	<p>While Bitcoin dropped dramatically at the time, coins like Ethereum (ETH) dropped harder, with the ETH/BTC pair falling to a ratio of just 0.05.</p>
      <p>A similar decline took place this month as ETH/BTC fell from 0.07 on June 6 to 0.064 at writing time.</p>
      <p>Other top altcoins—including Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC)—also suffered substantially relative to Bitcoin following a US regulator’s lawsuit against Coinbase alleging that all three coins are unregistered securities. Meanwhile, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has again clarified that he views Bitcoin as a commodity.</p>
      <p>In a lawsuit against Binance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) called the exchange’s native token BNB a security. The token—the fourth largest crypto by market cap—has plummeted 20% since the start of the month.</p>
      <p>The Bitcoin dominance metric has often been criticized for under-representing Bitcoin’s true market share by including stablecoins within its calculations, which are effectively dollars trading on the blockchain. However, even the stablecoin market has receded this year after Paxos was forced by the SEC to start winding down BUSD in February, erasing billions of dollars in tokens from circulation.</p>
      <p>Last Tuesday, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman Michael Saylor predicted that Bitcoin dominance will rise above 80% as regulators continue clamping down on other digital assets.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is up 6% since last week after BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF, for which investors are optimistic may receive unique approval from the SEC.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>International investors in Hong Kong are now able to buy shares denominated in the Chinese renminbi, as part of a new scheme launched by the city’s stock exchange on Monday.</p>
    	<p>Two dozen major Hong Kong and Chinese companies, including Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan and AIA Group, can now be traded in both the Hong Kong dollar (the city’s local currency) and the yuan. Shares denominated in one currency can be freely interchanged with shares denominated in the other.</p>	
    	<p>In total, the firms taking part in the “HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model” are worth about $1.5 trillion in value, or over a third of the entire Hong Kong stock market.</p>	
    	<p>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), which runs the city’s stock market, hopes an influx of yuan-denominated trading will bolster the city’s sluggish trading volumes. (While the scheme is currently only available to local and international investors, HKEX hopes to expand the scheme to mainland China later this year.)</p>
      <p>In a Monday interview with CNBC, Nicolas Aguzin, CEO of HKEx, suggested that the ability to “transact in an instant basis in renminbi” would be a “huge difference” for mainland retail investors.</p>
      <p>(Hong Kong, unlike China, has an open financial market with a freely-convertible local currency.)</p>
      <p>Yet Aguzin shared another benefit to HKEx’s new program: That it would “continue helping on the internationalization of the renminbi.”</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell just over 0.6% on Monday. The index has fallen 1.2% so far this year, after a brief rally following China’s reopening fizzled out as the country’s recovery lost steam.</p>
      <h3>The global yuan</h3>
      <p>China has tried to encourage more global use of the renminbi as an alternative to the U.S. dollar for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has boosted the yuan’s international status. U.S. sanctions on Russia–including freezing the country’s reserves of U.S. dollars–have forced Moscow to turn to other currencies to conduct international trade.</p>
      <p>The yuan surpassed the U.S. dollar as Russia’s most traded foreign currency earlier this year, according to Bloomberg, as more Russian companies bought and sold goods in the Chinese market.</p>
      <p>Even other countries, like Bangladesh and Pakistan, are turning to the yuan to do business with Russia. Hong Kong hopes that some of these countries might now invest their holdings of Chinese currency in the city's new yuan-denominated shares.</p>
      <p>The share of trade conducted in China’s currency rose to 4.5% in February, compared to less than 2% a year earlier. That’s close to the share of trade conducted in the euro.</p>
      <p>Recent problems in the U.S.—such as the tense debate over raising the U.S.’s borrowing limit, which risked the country’s first-ever default—may also be sullying the safe reputation of the U.S. dollar.</p>
      <p>"The U.S. banking industry's turmoil, government debt problems, and huge deficits being monetised have damaged international confidence in the US dollar,” wrote Paul Chan, Hong Kong’s financial secretary, in a blog post last week tied to the launch of the “HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model.”</p>
      <p>(Hong Kong’s local currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Chan has firmly dismissed calls to unpeg the two currencies in the past.)</p>
      <p>Central banks are also considering the yuan to diversify their reserves. Eighty-five percent of central bank managers either invested in or were interested in investing in the Chinese currency last year, according to a survey from UBS.</p>

    	<p>After falling for seven straight months, the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index finally showed upticks in February and March. But according to economics research firm Capital Economics, the decline in the housing market is far from over.</p>
      <p>In their latest report, Capital Economics researchers point out that the increase in home prices in February and March was because of higher demand as a result of declining mortgage rates at the start of this year. But that will prove to be short-lived.</p>
    	<p>“Rates have since returned close to the double-decade highs set in October, which has caused demand to fall to its lowest levels in almost 30 years,” the report stated.</p>
      <p>The economists suggest that because of high mortgage rates and a weakening economy, home prices will start declining again later this year.</p>
      <p>“We expect apartment capital values will plunge a further 20% in 2023 and 2024, resulting in a peak-to-trough fall of around 25%.”</p>
    	<p>It’s a scary picture. But not everyone shares the same outlook.</p>	
      <h3>‘A Big Beneficiary On The Way Out’</h3>
	    <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller recently said that housing “has obviously gone down dramatically given the 500 basis-point increase in interest rates.”</p>
      <p>But this is not doom and gloom, as the investing legend noted that there’s now a “structural shortage in single-family homes.”</p>
      <p>“So if things got bad enough, I could actually see housing — which is about the last thing you would think of intuitively — could be a big beneficiary on the way out,” Druckenmiller said.</p>
      <p>The reality is, no matter what happens, people will always need a place to live. Meanwhile, elevated mortgage rates mean owning a home is less feasible. And when people can’t afford to buy a home, renting becomes the only option. This creates a stable rental income stream for landlords.</p>
      <p>But you don’t actually need to buy a house to start collecting rental income.</p>
      <h3>Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful</h3>
      <p>Publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) own income-producing properties and pay dividends to shareholders. While the housing market faces uncertainty, Wall Street still sees a big upside in these residential REITs.</p>
      <p><strong>Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA):</strong> Mid-America Apartment Communities is a REIT primarily focusing on apartment communities in the high-growth Sun Belt region of the U.S. At the end of the first quarter, it had ownership interest in 101,986 apartment units, including communities currently under development. With a quarterly dividend rate of $1.40 per share, the REIT offers an annual yield of 3.6%. Goldman Sachs analyst Chandni Luthra has a Buy rating on Mid-America and a price target of $180. Because shares trade at $153.25 today, the price target implies a potential upside of 17%.</p>
      <p><strong>AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB):</strong> AvalonBay Communities is an apartment REIT that focuses on metropolitan areas in regions it believes are characterized by growing employment in high-wage sectors and lower housing affordability. These regions include New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest and Northern and Southern California. The stock has surged 17% year to date and Truist Securities analyst Michael Lewis sees more upside on the horizon. The analyst has a Buy rating on AvalonBay and a price target of $211 — around 11% above where the stock sits today. AvalonBay offers an annual dividend yield of 3.5%.</p>
      <p><strong>Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT):</strong> Camden Property Trust owns, manages, develops and acquires multifamily apartment communities. As of April 30, its portfolio consisted of 172 properties totaling 58,702 apartment homes. The REIT pays quarterly dividends of $1 per share, translating to an annual yield of 3.6%. Barclays analyst Anthony Powell has an Overweight rating on Camden and a price target of $137, implying a potential upside of 22%.</p>
      <p>Income investors are drawn to REITs because they are some of the higher-yielding names in the stock market. But remember, publicly traded REITs — including those that focus on apartment buildings — are still subject to the stock market’s ups and downs. If you don’t like the volatility associated with publicly traded REITs, there are options to invest in rental properties with as little as $100 through the private market.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Wall Street’s repeated recession warnings are beginning to lose their bite. After more than a year of consistent doomsday forecasts, the U.S. economy has remained resilient in the face of stubborn inflation, with the unemployment rate sticking near pre-pandemic lows and GDP growth continuing. The stock market has also rebounded after a bleak 2022, with the S&P surging nearly 16% year to date</p>
    	<p>Still, Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute, argues the evidence remains overwhelming that a “recession is at our doorstep.”</p>
      <p>“Much of the manufacturing sector of the economy is already in recessionary territory,” Cronk told reporters at a midyear outlook presentation this week, pointing to the ISM manufacturing index, which showed that the sector contracted for the seventh consecutive month in May.</p>	
      <p>He noted that leading economic indicators have also consistently declined for over a year and are “at levels consistent with past recessionary cycles.” To his point, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, which looks at data like building permits, average weekly hours worked, and manufacturers’ new orders to get a sense of the health of the economy, dropped for 13 consecutive months through April. Justyna Zabinska-LaMonica, senior manager of business cycle indicators at the Conference Board, said the data signals “a worsening economic outlook,” noting that “weaknesses among underlying components were widespread.”</p>
    	<p>Cronk did admit that the labor market has held up this year, and the services sector of the economy has remained “somewhat strong” owing to savings consumers built up during the pandemic, but he said he still fears the worst is yet to come for the economy. And Sameer Samana, Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s senior equity strategist, argued that investors aren’t properly pricing in this still gloomy economic outlook amid enthusiasm over the latest developments in artificial intelligence and fading inflation.</p>	
    	<p>“That’s the real dichotomy right now,” he explained at the midyear outlook presentation. “The market seems to be pricing in a very rosy scenario…and we just don’t think that’s going to end all that well.”</p>
      <h3>Priced for perfection</h3>
      <p>Inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target; Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that more interest rate hikes are on the way this year; and corporate profits have been falling since the second quarter of 2022. But despite the warning signs, investors are still willing to pay a pretty penny for stocks, lapping up shares at valuations well above historical norms throughout the year. Samana believes that might be a mistake owing to the ongoing “earnings recession.”</p>
      <p>The strategist noted that corporate revenues have been falling for a few quarters because “parts of the economy are already in recession,” and on top of that, the stronger than expected labor market has left many firms with “sticky” costs.</p>
      <p>“So what we’re noticing is margins are deteriorating—basically the top line is coming down faster than those sticky labor costs are going down,” he said. As a recession hits the economy later this year, slowing corporate revenue growth, along with higher labor costs, will hurt earnings; Samana believes the S&P 500 will therefore fall roughly 7% from its current level to 4,100.</p>
      <p>Still, there’s a reason so many investors have become increasingly bullish of late. With year-over-year inflation falling from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022 to just 4% in May, consumers are becoming more optimistic.</p>
      <p>The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment index rose to 63.9 in June from 59.2 last month, topping economists’ consensus expectations and pushing the index to its highest level since February.  And long-term inflation expectations also dropped slightly, from 3.1% to 3.0%, in a positive sign for economists who feared inflation expectations would become “entrenched” and keep prices elevated.</p>
      <p>Some analysts also believe A.I. is an $800 billion opportunity for tech firms alone this decade. Wedbush’s Dan Ives has repeatedly argued that the A.I. “gold rush” has just begun, comparing it to the start of the dotcom bubble that started inflating in 1995. And Tom Lee, cofounder of equity research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, who is known as the biggest bull on Wall Street, said earlier this week that he believes the economy is slipping into an “expansion” rather than a recession as inflation fades and the Federal Reserve ends its interest rate hiking cycle.</p>
      <p>For Samana, though, the risk might not be worth the reward. The strategist noted that the S&P 500 is currently trading at 20 times its peak earnings from last year, despite a recent earnings contraction.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to be in a highly volatile, higher inflation, elevated rate environment where the Fed may or may not be done [with interest rate hikes], and there’s a healthy dose of uncertainty to go alongside it. You probably don’t want to pay earnings multiples that are all that high in that environment,” he said. “I don’t think that we’re going to take off to the upside.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>After Big Tech's parabolic run, the debate now is whether to hold the shares or fold them. Strategists at Citi argue that they look more like sells than buys.</p>
    	<p>The question comes up because Nvidia NVDA +0.09%  (ticker: NVDA), Microsoft MSFT –1.66%  (MSFT), Meta Platforms META –0.29%  (META) and Alphabet GOOGL –1.25%  (GOOGL) have seen their stocks soar between 40% and about 200% this year. That has catapulted the Nasdaq 100 NDX –0.67%  Index to a gain of almost 40%.</p>	
	    <p>For Nvidia, fueling the surge have been expectations that advances in artificial intelligence will expand demand for the company’s semiconductors. Microsoft, an investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is expected to benefit not only from incorporating the technology into its Bing search engine, but also from layering AI into its cloud offering, helping to expand the market for it. For the internet, AI enhances Google and Meta’s advertising offerings, making them more compelling to brands.</p>	
	    <p>All that optimism has lifted valuations—the stocks’ prices relative to the per-share earnings they are expected to deliver over the near term. Investors are paying up because they expect profits to grow for many years.</p>
      <p>Valuations are a key part of the argument for selling now. Barron’s recently argued that tech multiples aren’t so expensive when adjusting them for the earnings growth Wall Street expects. But a look at history and a comparison of tech valuations to those in other sectors tells a different story.</p>
      <p>Citi compared the Nasdaq 100’s forward price/earnings ratio, at just over 27 times, according to FactSet, with the roughly 18 times for the S&P 1500, a metric the bank selected because it encapsulates many stocks across sectors. The Nasdaq 100 rarely trades at a premium much higher than this, according to Citi, and when it does, the average move the following year is a loss of 20%.</p>
      <p>Other data imply that investors are indeed overpaying for tech’s earnings growth potential. Many tech groups within the S&P 1500 are expected to see EPS growth outpace the broader index’s growth by about three to six percentage points. But some of those stocks’ valuations are far higher than for the index.</p>
      <p>Premiums vary, but one group of companies has traded at an average multiple five points higher than the S&P 1500 over the past five years, while valuations for a second group have been some 10 points higher. Those are big gaps: Premiums have averaged only one to three points in the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>This isn’t to say tech is necessarily in a bubble, or that these stocks are absolutely certain to see the double-digits drops they have faced in the past. Earnings growth could potentially take the stock prices higher over the years if investors remain willing to pay up now for future profits.</p>
      <p>And there is a case that they will. AI seems to be real, as shown by how much Nvidia’s sales guidance surpassed analysts’ estimates in its latest quarter. Brian Macauley, portfolio manager at Broad Run Investments, said he is looking for many years of earnings growth at Alphabet, a stock the firm owns.</p>
      <p>The real point is that there is some possibility that tech stumbles, or that it won’t be able to sustain its recent performance. Other opportunities in the market might look better, such as economically sensitive stocks outside of tech, which are positioned to thrive as the Fed eventually stops raising rates, allowing demand for goods and services to take off.</p>
      <p>“Sell tech” isn’t a wild idea by any stretch.</p>

    	<p>By Samuel Shen and Georgina Lee</p>
	    <p>SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's gradual internationalisation of its currency will shift to its next leg on Monday when about two dozen Chinese companies start trading in their home currency in Hong Kong's stock market.</p>	
	    <p>Hong Kong stocks such as Alibaba and Tencent are among the 24 stocks which will be priced and traded in both yuan and the Hong Kong dollar under the Dual Counter Model on the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKEX) from Monday.</p>	
	    <p>The scheme is targeting overseas investors with yuan holdings initially, but will later include mainland investors via the Hong Kong-China Stock Connect link-up later. Offshore yuan deposits in Hong Kong alone are estimated at some 833 billion yuan ($117 billion).</p>
      <p>Fund managers say the step reflects Beijing's desire to expand the use of yuan outside China and provide another avenue for yuan-denominated investment, thus reducing the risk of capital outflows chasing higher yielding currencies such as the U.S. dollar.</p>
      <p>"China is pushing yuan internationalisation to avert geopolitical risks and reduce reliance on the dollar, and for that purpose, you need wider use of the Chinese currency," said Ding Wenjie, strategist of Global Capital Investment at China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC).</p>
      <p>Ding said the scheme is a major milestone and expects the model to be expanded in future, beyond stocks to bonds and even alternative assets, boosting overseas asset pools denominated in yuan.</p>
      <p>The initiative comes amid a steady stream of bilateral yuan-denominated deals China has struck with trading partners, from Chinese oil purchases in the Middle East, to commodities trade with partners from Brazil to Russia. Beijing has retained close ties with Moscow despite the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar remains the dominant global currency, accounting for 42% of global payments. The yuan's share is just 2.29%, but is up from 1.95% two years ago.</p>
      <p>A significant breakthrough in China's efforts to promote use of the yuan came this month, when Pakistan paid for its first government-to-government import of discounted Russian crude oil in yuan.</p>
      <p>"When a currency is internationalised, it's not only used in trade, physical goods, or services. It also has to be parked in investment vehicles," said Dong Chen, Head of Asia Macroeconomic Research at Pictet Wealth Management.</p>
      <p>For foreign investors with yuan holdings, "buying shares in Hong Kong without really going into mainland China will be a much, much easier way to park your holdings of this currency," he said.</p>
      <h3>YUAN INCENTIVES</h3>
      <p>Under the dual counter arrangement, investors can choose to trade a stock either using Hong Kong dollars via the HKD counter, or yuan via the RMB counter, with market makers providing liquidity and minimizing price discrepancies.</p>
      <p>Most of the first batch of stocks eligible for yuan trading - which include AIA Group, Sun Hung Kai Properties and Hang Seng Bank Ltd - are not listed in China.</p>
      <p>Fund managers expect a lukewarm interest in the yuan counters initially, given near-term risks including a weakening yuan and wobbly stocks as China's economy struggles. But they expect demand to pick up over time.</p>
      <p>"Mainland investors, including mutual fund companies like us, have genuine incentives to trade Hong Kong stocks in yuan," said Ding of ChinaAMC.</p>
      <p>"Our fund returns and dividends are priced in yuan, so using the RMB counter can remove forex exchange costs, and shield us from currency volatility."</p>
      <p>There are many other reasons to trade in yuan, said David Friedland, Asia Pacific managing director at Interactive Brokers, which offers yuan-trading services.</p>
      <p>"There's lot of political uncertainty these days so you may want to hold yuan rather than U.S. dollars, or the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar."</p>

    	<p>NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets took a breather on Friday after a run to 14-month highs, while the U.S. dollar headed for its biggest weekly slide since January following a heavy week of central bank meetings around the world.</p>	
    	<p>The MSCI All-World index edged down 0.06% but remained near its highest level since mid-April 2022. Wall Street's main equity indexes ended lower but tallied solid weekly gains.</p>	
	    <p>Ending an intense week of central bank actions, the Bank of Japan maintained its ultra-easy monetary policy on Friday despite stronger-than-expected inflation. Earlier in the week the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged, while suggesting more hikes could come later in the year, and the European Central Bank hiked by a quarter-point.</p>
      <p>"We have had a pretty constructive week,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.</p>
      <p>“The ECB and the UK likely are still in the process of being in the throes of tightening, where the U.S. is certainly knocking on the door of being through with the rate hiking cycle and I think that has been driving some divergences.”</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 108.94 points, or 0.32%, to 34,299.12, the S&P 500 lost 16.24 points, or 0.37%, to 4,409.6 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 93.25 points, or 0.68%, to 13,689.57.</p>
      <p>The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7% for a 10th straight week of gains.</p>
      <p>In currency markets, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.18%, with the euro down 0.09% to $1.09.</p>
      <p>Still, the dollar was set to log its biggest weekly percentage drop since mid-January.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the yen fell to its lowest point against the euro in 15 years after the BOJ's decision. The Japanese currency also weakened 1.07% versus the greenback at 141.84 per dollar, dropping to a six-month trough.</p>
      <p>"The yen is suffering from a big negative yield gap versus other G10 currencies," said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at UBS in New York.</p>
      <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising after two straight days of declines as comments from Fed officials indicated the central bank was not yet done with its interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Fed Governor Christopher Waller said at an economics conference that core inflation "is not coming down like I thought it would," which probably would require more tightening.</p>
      <p>Benchmark 10-year notes were up 4 basis points to 3.77% from 3.73% late on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Oil prices rose and posted a weekly gain, as higher Chinese demand and OPEC+ supply cuts lifted prices.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude settled up 1.6% at $71.78 per barrel and Brent settled at $76.61, up 1.2% on the day.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Chinese equities led gains in Asian shares Thursday after the Federal Reserve paused monetary tightening and the People’s Bank of China cut a key lending rate amid speculation that more stimulus is on the way.</p>
    	<p>Hong Kong’s benchmark index advanced as much as 1.8%, with notable strength in tech stocks. Japanese equities fluctuated after a four-day rally. Australian stocks recovered after initially paring gains on strong jobs data that bolstered the case for further interest rate hikes from the central bank.</p>	
    	<p>The dollar rose while the offshore yuan strengthened after weakening earlier Thursday. Selling in the yen pushed the currency to the lowest level since November. The yen weakness prompted a warning from Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno that excessive movements weren’t desirable.</p>	
    	<p>Treasury yields climbed with the 10-year adding four basis points and the two year rising six basis points. Australia’s sovereign yield curve inverted for the first time since the global financial crisis as policy-sensitive three-year rates surged on the nation’s employment figures.</p>
      <p>European futures fell ahead of the ECB’s expected hike while contracts for US benchmarks were flat. The S&P 500 had gained just 0.1% on Wednesday after Fed chief Jerome Powell said nearly all Fed officials expected it would be appropriate to raise interest rates “somewhat further” in 2023. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.7%, bringing its gain since the start of the year to 37%.</p>
      <p>With a pause and hawkish outlook from the Fed widely anticipated, much of the focus in the Asian trading session was on China. The PBOC cutting of its medium-term lending facility rate has paved the way for banks to lower lending rates next week.</p>
      <p>The PBOC’s move also forms part of broader stimulus efforts to support real estate and domestic demand. Data showing retail sales moderated more than expected in May added to worries about further slowing in China. Industrial production was also lower but met consensus forecasts.</p>
      <p>“They need a larger package, not just about the monetary policy or mortgage rate cut but also to restore the confidence of the private sector,” Raymond Yeung, Greater China Economist at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd., said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.</p>
      <p>Economic troubles in New Zealand were also rippling through markets Thursday, with the nation’s sovereign bond yields falling after gross domestic product data showed the country fell into a recession in the first quarter following an aggressive run of policy tightening.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in markets, oil rose after a drop driven by a surprise jump in US crude stockpiles and the Fed’s hawkish outlook.</p>
      <h3>Key events this week:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde holds press conference following the rate decision, Thursday</li>
        <li>US initial jobless claims, retail sales, empire manufacturing, business inventories, industrial production, Thursday</li>
        <li>Bank of Japan rate decision, Friday</li>
        <li>US University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday</li>

    	<p>HONG KONG (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group is cutting more than 30 banking jobs in Asia, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, as a challenging markets environment weighs on Wall Street banks' dealmaking and trading revenues.</p>	
    	<p>The reduction in regional jobs, most of which are in the global banking & markets division, started on Wednesday, said the sources.</p>	
    	<p>China-focused bankers were hit hardest, with nine equities capital markets bankers who are based in Beijing and Hong Kong being laid off, including a managing director, according to another two sources.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The fresh cuts in Asia are part of Goldman's new round of layoffs globally that will see fewer than 250 jobs go in the coming weeks, according to a fifth person with knowledge of the situation.</p>
      <p>Wall Street banks have been reducing headcounts since late last year as a slump in dealmaking weighed on their revenues.</p>
      <p>Rival Morgan Stanley planned to eliminate about 3,000 jobs in the second quarter, in its second round of layoffs in six months, Reuters reported last month.</p>
      <p>Citigroup is letting go 20 to 25 investment bankers in Asia, mostly junior and based in China and Hong Kong, according to a separate source familiar with the bank's plans.</p>
      <p>Citi's chief financial officer said Wednesday it would book severance costs associated with around 1,600 job cuts. Since the start of the year, the bank has incurred costs related to a 5,000 headcount reduction taking place across the firm, largely in banking, markets and functions.</p>
      <p>In Asia however the bank has hired several hundred people since the start of 2022 in its wealth management division based in Singapore and Hong Kong, the person said.</p>
      <p>A Citi spokesperson declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported about the Asia cuts on Thursday.</p>
      <p>All sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Mike Wilson isn’t afraid to stand out from the crowd in an industry that doesn’t often reward that type of behavior. In late 2021, the Wall Street veteran, who is now Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer and chief U.S. equity strategist, argued that a bear market was on the way amid the toxic combination of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and slowing economic growth—which he labeled “fire” and “ice.”</p>
    	<p>At the time, the consensus forecast on Wall Street was for the S&P 500 to rise roughly 1% to 4,825 by the end of 2022, but Wilson’s price target was the lowest of his peers at 4,400, with a bear case of below 4,000. The pessimistic prediction turned out to be correct, as the S&P 500 slipped roughly 20% last year to 3,839, earning Wilson top stock strategist honors in an October 2022 survey by Institutional Investor.</p>	
    	<p>But 2023 has been a different story.</p>	
    	<p>In January, the Morgan Stanley CIO argued that the S&P 500 could drop as low as 3,000 in the first half of the year as corporate earnings growth slowed, before mounting a second half recovery to 3,900. But the index has done pretty much the opposite, rising more than 12% year to date to over 4,300 on the back of slowly fading inflation and enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as a potential driver of future corporate growth.</p>
      <p>Still, even as other investment banks have begun to increase their price targets for the blue-chip index—Goldman Sachs, for example, now sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 4,500, up from 4,000 at the start of the year—Wilson isn’t backing down from his bear market thesis.</p>
      <p>“With the S&P 500 rally now crossing the 20% threshold, more are declaring the bear market officially over. We respectfully disagree due to our 2023 earnings forecast,” he wrote in a Monday note. “The bear is still alive.”</p>
      <p>Wilson’s base case is for the S&P 500 to drop roughly 3% over the next 12 months to 4,200, but in a bear case scenario, he believes the index could fall to 3,700, or around 14% from current levels. He argues that stocks are in the midst of an “earnings recession” that hasn’t been priced in, and Wall Street’s profit expectations are too robust.</p>
      <p>More than 70% of S&P 500 sectors have forward earnings expectations from Wall Street that are “at least 20% above pre-COVID levels,” Wilson wrote Monday, noting that even Morgan Stanley’s earnings forecast for the overall index, which is seen as bearish on the Street, is “10% above the long-term earnings trend line.”</p>
      <p>The key to Wilson’s bearish theory is the idea that falling inflation will lower corporate profits, just as rising inflation helped to increase them in 2021. As Fortune previously reported, businesses were able to pass on rising costs during the pandemic and increase profit margins. But now, with inflation falling and economic growth slowing, we’re entering a natural period of “margin compression.”</p>
      <p>“That’s driven by the same things that made the profits go up, coming down,” explained John Leer, chief economist at business intelligence firm Morning Consult. “You’ve got weaker demand, realized and expected; you’ve got slower inflation, realized and expected; and less ability for businesses to pass along elevated costs to consumers.”</p>
      <p>Wilson also argued on Monday that higher interest rates are leading the economy into a “boom/bust regime” like what was seen after World War II. He explained that during both WWII and the pandemic, consumers built up excess savings during a period when the supply of goods and services was constrained, causing inflation and the stock market to surge when the economy reopened.</p>
      <p>Then a period of higher interest rates followed, which ultimately sparked a bear market and a recession in 1948. But before the economy entered that recession, there was a sizable bear market rally that lured in many investors. Wilson fears modern investors are falling into this same trap again.</p>
      <p>“After the boom in 1946 following the end of the war, the S&P 500 corrected by 28%, followed by a 24% choppy bear market rally that lasted almost 18 months before succumbing to new lows a year later. Thus far, this appears similar to the current bear market, which corrected 27.5% last year and has now rallied 24% from the intraday lows,” he wrote, arguing more pain is likely ahead for stock market investors.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The stock market started the week in the green ahead of the Fed meeting this week. Tesla rallied for 12th day in row.</p>
    	<p>The major stock market indexes improved at midday Monday, with the S&P 500 maintaining a key level. Two key economic reports could affect the Fed's next policy move, which in turn could move markets this week.</p>	
    	<p>The May consumer price index report is due Tuesday morning. According to Econoday, May's CPI is expected to rise 0.2% on the month, with the annual inflation rate easing to 4.1% from 4.9%.</p>	
      <p>The core CPI, excluding food and energy, is forecast to rise 0.4%, lowering the core inflation rate to 5.3% from 5.5%.</p>
      <p>The May producer price index (PPI) is out Wednesday morning and is forecast to slow to 2.9% from 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
      <p>These two reports could sway the Fed's policy decision. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield added 4 basis points to 3.78%. The CME FedWatch tool now shows analyst consensus of over 70% odds for no rate hike at this week's meeting, and the remainder expect a quarter-point hike.</p>
      <h3>Index Moves</h3>
    	<p>The Nasdaq strengthened its gain to 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1%. The S&P 500 pulled ahead 0.3% and was just above the 4,300 level. The index met resistance there last August, which makes it an important level to watch.</p>
      <p>The Russell 2000 was in line with the S&P 500 Index, adding 0.3%.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) added 0.8% as some major techs showed strength. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ETF (QQEW) crept up 0.6%.</p>
      <p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) outperformed with a 1% increase.</p>
      <p>NYSE volume was relatively flat and Nasdaq volume rose from Friday's levels at the same time.</p>
      <p>Crude oil fell 3.2% to $67.92 per barrel. Gold futures edged 0.4% lower.</p>
      <p>The price of Bitcoin shed 2.2% to $25,885 in sympathy with the smaller cryptocurrency coins that sold off on Saturday amid the SEC crackdown. Coinbase (COIN) tumbled 5.1%.</p>
      <p>European stocks closed higher, with the German DAX adding 0.9% and Paris CAC rising 0.5%. The London FTSE was the weakest, with only a 0.1% gain.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Movers: Tesla Up Again</h3>
      <p>Leaderboard stock Tesla (TSLA) added another 1% in heavier-than-average daily volume, and is on track for its 12th consecutive gain. That would be its longest winning streak since June 2010.</p>
      <p>Akero Therapeutics (AKRO) popped 6.6% and broke out of a saucer base. The buy zone from the 54.88 buy point goes to 57.62. The move came after Morgan Stanley raised its price target to 70 from 65 and maintained its overweight rating.</p>
      <p>Biogen (BIIB) rose 1.9% and is rising from support in a pullback to the 50-day moving average. Late Friday, the company said a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) committee supported its Alzheimer's drug.</p>
      <p>Chinook Therapeutics (KDNY) rocketed 57% in heavy volume on news it agreed to be acquired by Novartis (NVS) for $3.2 billion in cash. Shares gapped out of a cup-with-handle base. NVS dipped 1.3% on the news.</p>
      <p>Oracle (ORCL) rallied 6.6% ahead of its quarterly results after today's market close. A Wolfe Research analyst raised his rating to outperform from peer perform, with a price target of 130. Shares have reached the 20% profit target from a breakout at 91.22 in late March. With earnings due, investors have the option to lock in profits.</p>
      <p>The Zacks consensus estimate is for adjusted profit of $1.58 a share, up 3% from a year ago. Revenue is seen rising 16% to $3.74 billion.</p>
      <p>Adobe (ADBE) added another 3.1% on top of Friday's 3.4% rally. Shares are above a 451.15 buy point. The relative strength line hit a 52-week high. Adobe reports its May-ended quarterly results Thursday after the market close.</p>
      <h3>Cruise Line Stocks Take Off</h3>
      <p>Cloud-based software stock Integration Appliance (INTA), commonly known as Intapp, soared 8.6% in heavy volume and broke out of a base. The buy zone from the 47.04 buy point goes to 49.39.</p>
      <p>Its relative strength line hit a new 52-week high on the weekly chart as shown by the blue dot, according to MarketSmith pattern recognition. Intapp was the IPO Stock of the Week. It has gained 90% this year so far.</p>
      <p>Carnival (CCL) jumped 13% after JPMorgan Chase upgraded the cruise line stock to overweight from neutral and raised its price target to 16 from 11. Shares are above the 5% buy zone from the 12.62 buy point. Carnival is the S&P 500's biggest gainer today.</p>
      <p>IBD 50 stock Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) spiked 7.7% after JPMorgan Chase and BofA Securities raised their price targets on the stock.</p>
      <p>The stock rose past a cup-base buy point of 18.12 and is in a buy zone to 19.03. Volume is heavy.</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq Slides On Acquisition</h3>
      <p>Nasdaq (NDAQ) fell 13.2% on news it will buy bank and brokerage software company Adenza for $10.5 billion in cash and stock from private-equity firm Thoma Bravo. The acquisition is expected to close in the next six to nine months. NDAQ is the S&P 500's biggest loser today.</p>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 1.9% after KeyBanc raised its price target to 150 from 110 and maintained its overweight rating on the semiconductor company.</p>
      <p>Bill (BILL) shed 0.5% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight and kept its price target at 105.</p>

        <li>David Rosenberg says the bull market in stocks won't last, and a recession seems assured.</li>
        <li>The veteran economist noted that jobless claims just hit their highest level since October 2021.</li>
        <li>Rosenberg pointed to a slew of indicators suggesting stocks are overvalued and destined to tumble.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>The stock market's powerful rally is unfounded, and the US economy is virtually guaranteed to sink into recession, David Rosenberg has warned.</p>
    	<p>The S&P 500 officially entered a bull market on Thursday, as it notched a 20% gain from its October lows. Meanwhile, unemployment data released the same day showed initial jobless claims rose to 261,000 last week, the highest level since October 2021.</p>	
    	<p>"This market continues to be nothing more than a short-term momentum play," the veteran economist and Rosenberg Research president said in a morning note.</p>	
	    <p>Rosenberg underscored the disconnect between the stock-market milestone and softening labor market. He questioned whether current equity valuations are justified given the darkening economic backdrop.</p>
      <p>"You can believe the press headlines or you can believe the leading indicators — which suggest that we do indeed have a 99.15% chance of an official NBER-defined recession," he said. "And if that is the case, then it is the first time in recorded history that a fundamental bear market ended before the downturn even arrived."</p>
      <p>Rosenberg suggested that aggressive federal spending last year may have pushed back the recession. He described the fiscal support as "the Energizer Bunny gift that just kept on giving."</p>
      <p>Moreover, the former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch underlined the immense optimism priced into stocks. He noted the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings multiple is 25% above its long-term average, and the index is heavily concentrated, as it was during the dot-com bubble.</p>
      <p>He also pointed to low volatility expectations as evidence of deep complacency among investors, and cautioned that sentiment is "quickly hitting uber-bullish levels as FOMO stages a resurrection."</p>
      <p>Rosenberg has been sounding the alarm for several months. In late April, he predicted a recession by September, a 20% plunge in the S&P 500, and a credit crunch as banking fears strangled lending. He also told Insider in February that house prices could tumble by 15%-20%.</p>
      <p>Numerous market commentators have warned that asset prices will fall and the economy will contract. They've pointed to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from nearly zero to upwards of 5% since last spring, which has encouraged saving and made borrowing far more costly.</p>
      <p>Higher rates help to combat inflation, but they're typically bad news for consumer spending, debt-reliant industries such as commercial real estate, and riskier assets such as stocks.</p>

    	<p>MasterCard (MA) closed the most recent trading day at $369.22, moving +0.44% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.12%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.13%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.09%.</p>

    	<p>MasterCard will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, MasterCard is projected to report earnings of $2.98 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 16.41%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.18 billion, up 12.48% from the year-ago period.</p>	
    	<p>For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.25 per share and revenue of $25.15 billion, which would represent changes of +15.02% and +13.11%, respectively, from the prior year.</p>
      <p>Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.</p>
      <p>Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% lower. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MasterCard has a Forward P/E ratio of 30 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.25, which means MasterCard is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
      <p>We can also see that MA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.72. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. MA's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.1 as of yesterday's close.</p>
      <p>The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 161, which puts it in the bottom 37% of all 250+ industries.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Fed's Wednesday policy news will be the market's focal point for the week, along with earnings from Adobe, Oracle and Lennar.</p>
    	<p>A four-day rally gave the Dow industrials a better-than-3% gain so far for June. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up almost that much. While early gains on the stock market this year relied primarily on a narrow roster of tech names, the past week showed increasing breadth. The Federal Open Market Committee's rate policy decision on Wednesday will be the coming week's centerpiece. But earnings from Lennar (LEN), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) will also update segments with some fast-moving stocks.</p>	
    	<h3>Stocks To Watch: 5 Dow Giants Near Buy Points</h3>
      <p>Boeing (BA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), McDonald's (MCD) and Walmart (WMT) are five Dow Jones industrials stocks near buy points as the stock market rally shows signs of broadening out. All five hail from different sectors, hinting at widening market leadership. Boeing and Walmart are already actionable as they retake support within consolidations. JPMorgan is near a breakout in a six-week flat base, as the banking giant stands out among financials. Cisco is not the leader in its industry, but is trying to make a move and may be shaping a handle on its 10-week cup pattern. McDonald's has done well in a strong sector, eyeing a possible early entry in a new flat base.</p>	
      <h3>Fed Meeting Could Mark A Change</h3>
    	<p>The Federal Reserve is expected to skip a rate hike at its two-day policy meeting that wraps up on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. But Wall Street's reaction may be shaped by perceptions of what happens next. As of Friday morning, markets were still pricing in 66% odds of a quarter-point rate hike on July 26. Those odds could shift on Wednesday when policymakers lay their cards on the table.</p>
      <p>New quarterly economic projections released with the 2 p.m. policy announcement, including the expected year-end level for the Fed's key interest rate, will reveal the breadth of support for further tightening. Investors also will hang on every word of chair Jerome Powell's 2:30 p.m. news conference, which will sketch out the Fed's latest thinking on the impact of the bank crisis, the tight labor market and, quite possibly, the recent stock market rally.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Perspective: Stocks Rally Out Of Solid Q1 Season</h3>
      <p>A second straight up week propelled the Dow industrials toward the 34,000 mark for the first time since early May. The S&P 500 sits on a four-week gain, and now back above 4,300. And the Nasdaq composite's seven -week rally put it at its highest mark in 14 months. S&P Capital IQ reported, as of Tuesday, 51% of S&P 500 stocks were in positive territory for the year. S&P 500 Q1 2023 EPS came in better than expected, falling 1.2% year-over-year, versus the March 31 forecast for a 6.5% decline. Estimates now point to a 7.5% drop in Q2, a 0.5% dip in Q3, and an 8.3% increase in Q4. For all of 2023, S&P Capital IQ sees the S&P 500 turning in a 0.4% decline, followed by an 11.7% advance in 2024.</p>
      <h3>Earnings Season: A Look At AI, Cloud Momentum</h3>
      <p>Oracle (ORCL) shares ride a four-month advance, up almost 35% year-to-date heading into the software heavyweight's fiscal Q4 earnings report late Monday. Four analysts on Friday raised their price targets to between 106 and 130. Deutsche Bank says Oracle's momentum appears durable in the cloud and software-as-a-service businesses. License revenue, "the greatest swing factor," will be closely watched. Citi also notes strong cloud momentum across "corporate and generative artificial intelligence." Oracle earnings turned higher in Q3, after three quarters of no growth. Analysts see a modest 2.5% advance in Q4, according to FactSet, before accelerating in the coming fiscal year.</p>
      <h3>Homebuilders: Lennar Rallies Into Q2 Report</h3>
      <p><strong>Lennar (LEN)</strong>   reports Q2 results late Wednesday, with homebuilder stocks charging higher amid a tight U.S. housing market. Wall Street expects Lennar's earnings per share to sink 49% to $2.31, with revenue sliding 14% to $7.19 billion. Analysts see full-year EPS dropping 36% to $10.01 and sales falling 13% to $29.35 billion. Lennar's earnings have decelerated over the past four quarters. Revenue growth slowed from 30% in Q2 of last year.</p>
      <p>The Building-Residential/Commercial industry group ranks No. 5 out of 197 tracked by IBD with homebuilder stocks collectively advancing 29% year to date. Lennar has gained 24%. Fellow homebuilder KB Home (KBH) is expected to report its fiscal Q2 earnings on June 21. PulteGroup (PHM) and Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) will announce financials in July, which could give a lift to homebuilder stocks. All three stocks are trading at fresh highs.</p>
      <h3>Econ Calendar: Inflation, Regional Fed Surveys, Consumer Confidence</h3>
      <p>The batch of economic data on tap in the coming week, including a big inflation report on Tuesday, could shift Fed rate-hike expectations, but probably for July's meeting, not this week's. The consumer price index for May, out Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., is seen rising 0.3% on the month, with the annual inflation rate easing to 4.1% from 4.9%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, is forecast to rise 0.4%, lowering the core inflation rate to 5.3% from 5.5%. The producer price index, out Wednesday at 8:30, is expected to show wholesale inflation slowing to 1.1% from 2.3%. Core PPI inflation is forecast to ease to 2.9% from 3.2%. Retail sales for May, out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., are expected to be flat vs. April levels, with a modest 0.1% rise excluding autos. Industrial production, out Thursday at 9:15 a.m., should show overall May output rising 0.1%, but with a solid 0.4% rise in manufacturing output.</p>
      <p><strong>Jabil (JBL)</strong> plans to release its fiscal third-quarter results early Thursday. Wall Street predicts the contract electronics manufacturer will earn $1.88 a share, up 12% year over year, on sales of $8.19 billion, down 2%. Jabil stock is in record-high territory after breaking out of a cup base.</p>
      <p><strong>Kroger (KR)</strong> reports Q1 results early Thursday after three quarters of decelerating sales growth. FactSet analysts expect earnings to slide 1.4% to $1.43 per share on a 1.3% drop in sales to $45.19 billion. Kroger is attempting to acquire privately held grocer Albertsons in a $24.6 billion deal.</p>
      <p><strong>Adobe (ADBE)</strong> will report its Q2 results late Thursday. Analysts expect the design software maker to earn $3.79 a share, up 13% year over year, on sales of $4.77 billion, up 9%. Adobe stock is in a cup base with a 451.15 buy point.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- The bearish tide against Chinese equities is growing but for some money managers, the stocks are value for money.</p>
    	<p>JPMorgan Asset Management is adding more Chinese shares to its portfolio on bets that the market’s inexpensive valuation and the government’s support for the economy will bolster returns. Invesco Asset Management Ltd. is overweight the stocks, and favors top tech names such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.</p>	
    	<p>The optimism shows some market veterans are wagering on a revival even as Wall Street banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut their forecasts for key Chinese equity indexes. Hopes are mounting that policy makers will deliver more stimulus to shore up growth, after authorities asked the nation’s biggest banks to lower deposit rates.</p>	
    	<p>Looking at “where the valuations are today, it is probably good to go a bit overweight,” Ayaz Ebrahim, JPMorgan’s emerging market and Asia Pacific equities portfolio manager, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “From a more neutral position we have been adding again.”</p>
      <p>Geopolitical risks and an underwhelming economic recovery have turned Chinese equity gauges into global underperformers, with the MSCI China and the Hang Seng China Enterprises indexes both falling into bear markets in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>While pessimism remains dominant, some are sensing a bottom. Authorities were said to have asked the nation’s biggest banks to lower their deposit rates for at least the second time in less than a year, marking an escalated effort to boost the world’s second-largest economy. The government is also mulling a new property support package, according to an earlier report.</p>
      <p>Ebrahim stressed that the market is inexpensive, given the government has taken steps to improve business and consumer confidence. On earnings-based valuations, the HSCEI index is trading below its five-year average, and is at a 6% discount to its one-year forward projected book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>While there has been some delay in the economic recovery, the market is “looking at 18%-19% earnings this year and about 15%-16% next year and is cheap,” Ebrahim said. “It is basically trading low, near book, and earnings are still coming through.”</p>
      <p>For Invesco, Chinese firms offer “pretty good value and earnings in some areas,” with companies such as Alibaba and Tencent focused on delivering shareholder returns, said Tony Roberts, who manages the Invesco Pacific Fund (UK).</p>
      <p>‘Too Cheap’</p>
      <p>The Invesco fund has been overweight Chinese equities since January 2022, with the stance reflecting its position in both China and Hong Kong shares, according to Roberts. The vehicle increased its holdings in Alibaba this year as the shares weakened, and the stock accounts for around 2.3% of its total holdings, he said.</p>
      <p>“You have just a general discount because US-China tensions are very high at the moment, so I think that also gives us an opportunity in China,” Roberts said in an interview. China’s big tech companies such as Alibaba and Tencent are “just too cheap.”</p>
      <p>The Invesco fund has returned 8.9% over the past three years to beat 93% of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It had £240.7 million ($299 million) of assets as of end-April, its factsheet showed.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan Asset, according to Ebrahim, went overweight on China after the lows of the third quarter last year and subsequently booked some profits to turn neutral as economic indicators continued to disappoint.</p>
      <p>Ebrahim is hopeful about Chinese consumption even though recent data show the recovery has weakened. Manufacturing activity contracted again in May, while home price growth slowed after a pickup earlier in the year. In the latest sign of economic gloom, China’s exports fell for the first time in three months in May.</p>
      <p>He added that his firm is looking at shares of component manufacturers and those tied to domestic spending. He prefers smaller stocks over larger peers.</p>

    	<p>By Joe Cash</p>
    	<p>BEIJING (Reuters) -China's exports shrank much faster than expected in May while imports extended declines with a grim outlook for global demand, especially from developed markets, raising doubts about the fragile economic recovery.</p>	
    	<p>The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter thanks to robust services consumption and a backlog of orders following years of COVID disruptions, but factory output has slowed as rising interest rates and inflation squeeze demand in the United States and Europe.</p>	
    	<p>Exports slumped 7.5% year-on-year in May, data from China's Customs Bureau showed on Wednesday, much larger than the forecast 0.4% fall and the biggest decline since January. Imports contracted 4.5%, slower than an expected 8.0% decline and April's 7.9% fall.</p>
      <p>"The weak exports confirm that China needs to rely on domestic demand as the global economy slows," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. "There is more pressure for the government to boost domestic consumption in the rest of the year, as global demand will likely weaken further in the second half."</p>
      <p>Highlighting the extent of the weakness, the data shows trade was worse even than when the port of Shanghai, China's busiest, was shut down due to strict COVID curbs a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The figures also add to a growing list of indicators that suggest China's post-COVID economic recovery is quickly losing steam, bolstering the case for more policy stimulus.</p>
      <h3>DEMAND SQUEEZE</h3>
      <p>Asian stocks fell into the red after the data as did the yuan and the Australian dollar, a commodity currency that is highly sensitive to swings in Chinese demand.</p>
      <p>China's post-pandemic stock rally has faded as small-time investors turn bearish on equities and double down instead on safer assets amid a stuttering economic recovery.</p>
      <p>The economy has been hit by a double whammy of faltering demand at home and abroad with the ripple effects felt across the region.</p>
      <p>South Korean data showed shipments to China slid 20.8% in May, marking a full year of monthly declines, with Korean semiconductor exports dropping 36.2%, suggesting weak demand for components for final manufacture.</p>
      <p>Chinese imports of semiconductors fell 15.3%, as the market for the consumer electronics exports that include such parts softened.</p>
      <p>Demand for raw materials broadly weakened with coal imports pulling back from the 15-month high hit in March, amid soft appetite from the power and steel sectors. Copper imports slid 4.6% in May from a year ago.</p>
      <p>China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) released last week showed factory activity shrank faster than expected in May.</p>
      <p>The PMI's subindexes also showed factory output swung to contraction from expansion while new orders, including new exports, fell for a second month.</p>
      <p>While economic growth beat expectations in the first quarter, analysts are now downgrading their forecasts for the rest of the year, as factory output slows.</p>
      <p>The government has set a modest GDP growth target of around 5% for this year, after badly missing the 2022 goal.</p>
      <p>"Looking forward, we think exports will fall further before bottoming out later this year," said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. "Although interest rates outside of China are near a peak, the lagged impact from the sharp rate hikes is set to weaken activity in developed economies later this year, triggering mild recessions in most cases."</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Apple's stock fell after it unveiled its new Vision Pro mixed reality headset. Yahoo Finance markets reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the charts.</p>
    	<p>- We're also keeping an eye on markets and Apple shares with ongoing events. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Jared, what else are you watching?</p>	
    	<p>JARED BLIKRE: Yes, well, let me just stick with Apple for a second because some pretty interesting developments. I was watching the presentation-- by the way, this was a long one today. If you look at the YFI Interactive, I have the intraday price action mapped out, and there was a bit of a decline coming into the opening remarks here.</p>	
    	<p>And then we really saw a big selloff, that big down red candle. That came off on the announcement of the headset. Is that ominous? I think it's a little bit too early to tell you, but I think it's notable too that, as you said, Akiko, Apple had climbed to a record high just before that announcement. And if we take a look at a two-year let me see if I can bring this up.</p>
      <p>Here's a two-year chart. You can see Apple has been on just a tear, really earning its weight within the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ 100 helping the NASDAQ to outperform the way it has. And Apple's not even really an AI stock. It does-- there's a ton of AI embedded in Apple products, but not to the degree that Microsoft and Alphabet have really pivoted there.</p>	
    	<p>So enough about Apple. Let me just get to our heat map through the day because as I was talking about, Friday was a really-- with that non-farm payroll was really a pivotal day in terms of the price action. We saw this huge spike up in the Dow as opposed to the NASDAQ. The Dow basically doubled or tripled the NASDAQ's performance, and that's something we haven't seen quite a bit.</p>	
    	<p>Now here, you can see today is kind of the flip of that. We have the Dow down the most. That's down about half a percent. NASDAQ down about a quarter of a percent. We'll have to see how this plays out, but it looked for a second on Friday like-- almost like November of 2020 with the new infrastructure play coming out.</p>
      <p>So not seeing any hints of that right now, so maybe it was just a one-day price action. But I think traders are going to be looking ahead, especially towards next week's CPI and the big Fed announcement, are we going to see any hiccups around those reports? Because remember, it's about jobs and it's about inflation, and anything else is just kind of not getting as much attention nowadays.</p>	
    	<p>Finally, here's the sector action on the S&P 500. Going to check out some heat maps here. Health care in the lead, followed by materials, communication services, it looks like utilities as well. But really not seeing a lot of outperformers here. Industrials, which was one of the big cyclical moves that we saw Friday, that is getting reversed. Industrials, XLI, down about 7/10 of a percent.</p>	
    	<p>Also saw some weakness today earlier on Bitcoin. Let me see if I can get some charts out on that. But even if those charts-- there we go. Bitcoin down on the news that Binance getting sued by the SEC in Washington DC Civil Court. Binance is a big one, guys. Globally, they are the biggest, and so you've got to think if Binance tumbles, you're going to see a lot more spillover.</p>
      <p>But look at this reaction here. This is not an absolute disaster. I'm looking at Bitcoin here. $25,000 is doable. If that's the end of this, fine. But I read the complaint, and there's probably a lot more that's going to come out of it.</p>	
    	<p>- Yeah, not an absolute disaster. I wonder if that-- that feels like that's kind of the bar we're looking at right now. But, Jared Blikre, from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, thanks so much for that.</p>

    	<p>BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Tesla Inc delivered 77,695 China-made electric vehicles (EVs) in May, a 2.4% jump from April, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Monday.</p>	
    	<p>On a yearly basis, sales rose 142% in May from 32,165 vehicles in the same month of 2022 when Shanghai, where its factory is located, was still subject to COVID-19 containment measures that impacted production.</p>	
    	<p>Chinese rival BYD Co Ltd, with its Dynasty and Ocean series of EVs and petrol-electric hybrid vehicles, logged sales of 239,092 vehicle in May, up 14% from April, CPCA data showed.</p>
      <p>CPCA is scheduled to release more detailed car sales figures for May later this month.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla has been under intense focus in China in recent weeks, amid an unannounced, high-stakes visit from boss Elon Musk.</p>
      <p>Musk wrapped up a two-day trip on Thursday that included talks with Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Wednesday in Beijing, a source told Reuters.</p>	
    	<p>The latest trip, Musk's first in three years after Beijing reopened its borders, came as Tesla faces intensifying competition from Chinese-made EV makers and uncertainty about expanding the Shanghai plant, its largest production hub.</p>
      <p>He also met with foreign, commerce and industry ministers, and dined with Zeng Yuqun, chairman of battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL).</p>	
    	<p>Musk visited Tesla's Shanghai factory late on Wednesday and met with Chen Jining, the ruling party's Shanghai secretary, on Thursday. Chen welcomed Tesla to increase investment and expand business in the city, according to a statement from the municipal government.</p>
      <p>In an action described as a product recall, Tesla is distributing over-the-air software updates for more than 1.1 million vehicles for a braking issue from May 29, China's market regulator said mid-May.</p>	
    	<p>Since May, Tesla has raised prices in countries including China, after earlier price cuts triggered a price war, with many international and local brands following suit.</p>
      <p>(This story has been corrected to clarify the BYD sales growth comparison is a monthly rise, not annual, in paragraph 3)</p>

    	<p>It was a decidedly low-key denouement to a monthslong drama that unnerved financial markets at home and abroad and caused anxious retirees and social service organizations to make contingency plans in case the country was unable to pay all its bills.</p>	
    	<p>Instead of holding a public ceremony with lawmakers from both parties — showcasing the bipartisanship that Biden had cited in an Oval Office address on Friday evening — the president signed the legislation in private in a reflection of the tight deadline facing the nation's leaders.</p>	
    	<p>The Treasury Department had warned that the country would start running short of cash on Monday, which would have sent shockwaves through the U.S. and global economies.</p>
      <p>The White House released a picture of the president signing the legislation at the Resolute Desk. In a brief statement, Biden thanked Democratic and Republican congressional leaders for their partnership, a cordial message that contrasted with the rancor that initially characterized the debt debate.</p>
      <p>“No matter how tough our politics gets, we need to see each not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans,” Biden said in a video message released after the signing. He said it was important to “stop shouting, lower the temperature, and work together to pursue progress, secure prosperity and keep the promise of America for everybody.”</p>
      <p>The standoff began when Republicans refused to raise the country’s borrowing limit unless Democrats agreed to cut spending. Eventually, the White House began weeks of intense negotiations with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to reach a deal.</p>
      <p>The final agreement, passed by the House on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday, suspends the debt limit until 2025 — after the next presidential election — and restricts government spending. It gives lawmakers budget targets for the next two years in hopes of assuring fiscal stability as the political season heats up.</p>
      <p>Raising the nation’s debt limit, now at $31.4 trillion, will ensure that the government can borrow to pay debts already incurred.</p>
      <p>After Congress passed the legislation, Biden used the occasion to deliver his first speech from the Oval Office as president on Friday.</p>
      <p>“No one got everything they wanted but the American people got what they needed,” he said, highlighting the “compromise and consensus” in the deal. “We averted an economic crisis and an economic collapse.”</p>
      <p>Biden touted the achievements of his first term as he runs for reelection, including support for high-tech manufacturing, infrastructure investments and financial incentives for fighting climate change. He also highlighted ways he blunted Republican efforts to roll back his agenda and achieve deeper cuts.</p>
      <p>“We’re cutting spending and bringing deficits down at the same time,” Biden said. “We're protecting important priorities from Social Security to Medicare to Medicaid to veterans to our transformational investments in infrastructure and clean energy.”</p>
      <p>Biden's remarks were the most detailed comments from the Democratic president on the compromise he and his staff negotiated. He largely remained quiet publicly during the high-stakes talks, a decision that frustrated some members of his party but was intended to give space for both sides to reach a deal and for lawmakers to vote it to his desk.</p>
      <p>Biden praised McCarthy and his negotiators for operating in good faith, and all congressional leaders for ensuring swift passage of the legislation. “They acted responsibly, and put the good of the country ahead of politics,” he said.</p>
      <p>In addition to restrictions on spending, the 99-page bill changes some policies, including imposing new work requirements for older Americans receiving food aid and greenlighting an Appalachian natural gas pipeline that many Democrats oppose. Some environmental rules were modified to help streamline approvals for infrastructure and energy projects — a move long sought by moderates in Congress.</p>
      <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation could actually expand total eligibility for federal food assistance, with the elimination of work requirements for veterans, homeless people and young people leaving foster care.</p>
      <p>The legislation also bolsters funds for defense and veterans, cuts back some new money for the Internal Revenue Service and rejects Biden’s call to roll back Trump-era tax breaks on corporations and the wealthy to help cover the nation’s deficits. But the White House said the IRS' plans to step up enforcement of tax laws for high-income earners and corporations would continue.</p>
      <p>The agreement imposes an automatic overall 1% cut to spending programs if Congress fails to approve its annual spending bills — a measure designed to pressure lawmakers of both parties to reach consensus before the end of the fiscal year in September.</p>
      <p>In both chambers, more Democrats backed the legislation than Republicans, but both parties were critical to its passage. In the Senate the tally was 63-36 including 46 Democrats and independents and 17 Republicans in favor, 31 Republicans along with four Democrats and one independent who caucuses with the Democrats opposed.</p>
      <p>The vote in the House was 314-117.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- The sharpest rally for Chinese stocks in three months is doing little to convince money managers that the market is set for a sustained turnaround.</p>
    	<p>After a punishing selloff that sent a gauge of Chinese equities in Hong Kong into a bear market earlier this week, hopes were lifted Friday thanks to Federal Reserve officials signaling they plan to keep interest rates steady at the upcoming meeting. The optimism boosted local and regional shares, particularly growth companies that closely track rates.</p>	
    	<p>The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 4.5%, the most since early March, with the gauge capping its first weekly gain in a month. An index of Chinese technology shares surged 5.3%. Key Chinese indexes had been hovering near oversold levels, suggesting it was time for some dip-buying.</p>	
    	<p>But even with the quick sentiment rebound, some investors warned caution about the broader woes that have plagued stocks in recent weeks — from a stalling economic recovery to rising Sino-American tensions. Until those issues are addressed, the outlook looks hazy at best.</p>
      <p>“There are so many macro concerns in China, and I would be cautious to chase any rally at the moment,” said Paul Pong, managing director at Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd. Given the uncertainty over the Fed’s rate hike cycle and stubborn US inflation, “the yuan will remain weak and that’s not going to encourage flows into Chinese assets,” he added.</p>
      <p>Pessimism has been running deep among China investors since the reopening rally faltered at the end of January. Bets that stocks will soon rebound have proven elusive, prompting bulls to pare back their allocations. The latest data on manufacturing and services showed the economy is on a wobbly footing, while the yuan’s weakness have accelerated outflows.</p>
      <p>In a bid to support the economy, authorities are working on new stimulus measures for the ailing property sector, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Longer term, geopolitical tensions with the West will likely continue to weigh on investors amid growing evidence that foreign firms are starting to align their business away from China.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley is letting go of at least six managing directors, including some key China bankers, as part of broader job cuts in Asia. Microsoft Corp.’s LinkedIn plans to shut its jobs app in China and cut hundreds of jobs while Ford Motor Co. is also reportedly planning to reduce more than a thousand jobs.</p>
      <p>Alexander Redman, chief strategist at CLSA, who saw about 70 investors in Europe and Singapore in the past month, described their consensus on Chinese equities as “utter despair, disillusionment and disappointment.”</p>
      <p>Strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. slashed the target for the MSCI China Index to 70 from 80 as they reduced earnings estimates and saw a stronger forecast for the greenback versus the yuan. But they retained an overweight recommendation, adding that investors’ concerns have been priced in.</p>
      <p>Some forecast relief rallies over the short term as hopes for Fed’s rate pause trigger gains across emerging markets. Low allocation by investors can provide a good backdrop for gains, according to Redmond Wong, strategist at Saxo Capital Markets HK Ltd.</p>
      <p>Valuation is also supportive. The Hang Seng China gauge is now trading at 7.6 times forward earnings, below the five-year average of 8.4. On the mainland, the CSI 300 benchmark advanced 1.4% on Friday as foreigners added 8.5 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) of onshore shares via trading links with Hong Kong. That was the largest daily net inflow since February.</p>
      <p>Focus is now on new data releases in the coming weeks on inflation and credit to gauge the health of the economy.</p>
      <p>“I do think there is some room for the Hong Kong market to rebound,” though they will still lag the peers in the US and EU, said Dickie Wong, director of research at Kingston Securities Ltd. “There are a lot of concerns over China’s economic recovery and the youth unemployment rate is very high. The 5% GDP target looks increasingly unattainable.”</p>

    	<p>Graphics chip maker has gained more than $650 billion in market value since October</p>
    	<p>An investor craze for artificial intelligence has powered Nvidia’s dizzying rise and pushed the stock to lofty valuations. Wall Street analysts are predicting it has more room to run.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia NVDA 5.12%increase; green up pointing triangle shares have nearly tripled in 2023, making them the best performers by far in the S&P 500. The graphics chip maker has gained more than $650 billion in market value since hitting a two-year low in October and briefly crossed the $1 trillion mark earlier this week.</p>	
    	<p>Enthusiasm for Nvidia among stock pickers has only grown as investors have piled in. Of the 49 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 41 have a buy rating on the stock. That is up from 30 in October.</p>
      <p>Their average 12-month price target on the stock falls just below $432, which implies gains of about 9% from Thursday’s close of $397.70. Price targets typically shift as analysts update their business forecasts.</p>
      <p>Nvidia’s surge picked up steam after the chip maker unveiled a blockbuster revenue target on May 24 for the quarter ending in July. The company expects to book $11 billion in sales, while the consensus forecast had called for roughly $7 billion.</p>
      <p>The company “just did something that a lot of people, reflexively, don’t know how to explain,” said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. He rates the stock “buy” and has a $600 price target, the highest on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>That has helped spark a rally throughout the chip industry. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, home to 30 stocks, has advanced 38% in 2023.</p>
      <p>Nvidia’s rise contrasts with much of the broader market. Eight of the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 are down this year. Yet the benchmark is up 9.9%, largely powered by the gains in a handful of big technology stocks. That raises the question of whether the rally will fizzle out or kick off a new bull market.</p>
      <p>The AI craze has been building since Microsoft announced a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI in January. Other large technology companies are also spending large sums to develop their own artificial intelligence programs. Nvidia, which sells graphics processing units, or GPUs, needed to power such programs, is currently the only viable supplier, analysts said.</p>
      <p>The result has been an arms race that has propelled Nvidia’s business more quickly than even bulls had expected. Nvidia has been able to double prices because of overwhelming demand, Mosesmann said.</p>
      <p>Skeptics on the stock are questioning its current valuation, even as they agree Nvidia is in a strong competitive position. The stock now trades at 49 times forward earnings, up from 27 times last fall. The S&P 500, in comparison, is trading at 18.2 times earnings.</p>
      <p>“We absolutely think Nvidia’s the best-positioned semiconductor company,” said Ruben Roy, managing director at investment bank Stifel. “What do you pay for that? That’s where we have a bit of an issue.” Roy has a hold rating on the stock and a price target of $370.</p>
      <p>Nvidia still scores highly compared with other semiconductor stocks. About 85% of analysts surveyed by FactSet recommend shares of Broadcom, while 64% of analysts recommend shares of Advanced Micro Devices. About one-fifth have a favorable opinion of Intel, which is in the midst of a turnaround effort.</p>
      <p>Yet Nvidia has only provided an outlook for the second quarter, leaving some uncertainty that the blowout quarter truly represents the new normal.</p>
      <p>“The question is to what extent is the guidance a pull-in effect or a reset higher?” said Angelo Zino, senior analyst at CFRA, with a $415 price target on the stock.</p>
      <p>Wall Street forecasts assume Nvidia’s business will keep growing. Analysts have penciled in $12 billion in quarterly revenue on average, by the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in January. That sum is projected to reach $14 billion by the fall of 2024.</p>
      <p>Some analysts said a high backlog of demand for chips makes revenue growth in the coming quarters easier to forecast, despite the lack of guidance beyond July.</p>
      <p>“If you order a GPU today, you’re not getting it for a year,” said C.J. Muse, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, who has a $500 price target on the stock. “It’s a really shrewd strategy to own the moat.”</p>

	    <p>According to data from S3 Partners Research, just five AI-related stocks have sparked more than $13 billion in mark-to-market losses for short sellers this year.</p>	
	    <p>The losses are big when you consider that the short interest as a percentage of share float is in the low single digits for these stocks, meaning that much of the losses were triggered not by so many people being caught on the wrong side of the trade, but instead by such massive rallies in the stock prices.</p>

        <li>Evercore's Mark Mahaney says Meta, Uber, and Amazon present key buying opportunities.</li>
        <li>"Meta's the cheapest high-quality tech stock out there, period," Mahaney said of his top pick.</li>
      </ul>
	    <p>It's been a great year for the technology sector, with the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 25% since the start of 2023.</p>
	    <p>As the sector pushes higher, Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said there are three names in particular that investors should be paying attention to.</p>	
    	<p>First on his list is Facebook parent Meta, which Mahaney says will have a "nice recovery in revenue growth" throughout 2023 due to three key offerings.</p>	
    	<p>"Meta's the cheapest high-quality tech stock out there, period. 14 times GAAP earnings and it's got three product cycles that it's going through. First is this Reel's monetization [program that] they successfully borrowed from or stole from TikTok. Second is that Click-to-Message product that's out in the market that's doing well," he told CNBC on Wednesday. "Third is I think they've just been able to recapture a lot of the advertising signal that they lost when Apple went through its privacy changes."</p>
      <p>Amazon stock, meanwhile, has underperformed for the past three years, Mahaney says, adding that he expects the share price to shoot up this year.</p>
      <p>"It's the triple trough thesis. We think the stock right here [has had] trough multiples, trough margins, and trough revenue growth. If we're right on that, you could have a material rewriting of the stock."</p>
      <p>Finally, Mahaney sees Uber as rounding out his top picks. He has a price target of $75 per share for the ride hailing company, around 98% upside from its current levels. He says Uber has three "value catalysts" that could propel its stock higher.</p>
      <p>"First catalyst is they're going to reach finally GAAP earnings status. We're going to start actually generating positive GAAP earnings," Mahaney said. "Secondly, we think they'll start buying back stock. And third is that we think they'll finally reach the metrics needed to be included in the S&P 500."</p>

	    <p>JPMorgan is leading the way in Wall Street's shift towards AI, according to data reported by Bloomberg.</p>
	    <p>The bank advertised 3,651 jobs globally from February through April with roles related to AI, per Bloomberg.</p>	
	    <p>The data comes from the consultancy Evident, with AI-related hires defined as data engineers and quants, as well as ethics and governance roles.</p>	
	    <p>JPMorgan's job adverts are nearly double that of its closest competitor, Citigroup, which advertised around 2,100 AI-related roles across the same time period, Bloomberg reported.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is working on plans to expand and revitalize its retail chain, aiming to push deeper into China and other parts of Asia while overhauling established locations in the US and Europe.</p>
	    <p>Through 2027, the iPhone maker is discussing opening 15 new stores across the Asia-Pacific region, five locations in Europe and the Middle East, and four additional outlets in the US and Canada, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations. The company is also aiming for six revamped or relocated stores in Asia, nine in Europe and 13 in North America, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. In total, the company is proposing 53 new, relocated or remodeled stores over the next four years.</p>	
	    <p>Apple looks to bring fresh luster to its 22-year-old retail operation, which is one of the world’s most venerated chains but also has contended with pandemic woes, customer service problems and labor unrest in recent years. The idea is to build Apple’s brand in growth markets, such as India, while also giving consumers in the US and Europe a better experience.</p>	
	    <p>The most notable new stores under discussion or in development include three sites in India, the company’s first outpost in Malaysia and an upgrade to Apple’s historic location in the Opera shopping area of Paris, according to the people. It’s also soon opening a store at the Battersea Power Station in London by its new local headquarters and is planning an additional location in Miami. And there’s a flagship store slated for the Jing’an Temple Plaza in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>Some of the future locations and their timing remain either internal projections or proposals, meaning they could either be delayed or canceled altogether. Still, many of the stores are already in development, with Apple having agreed to leases with landowners. A spokesman for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Apple currently has more than 520 stores in 26 countries, with roughly half of them located in the US. The chain is famously lucrative on a square-footage basis, but the stores are often more about building Apple’s brand than selling goods. The company gets most of its revenue from other channels, including its e-commerce site. Still, the brick-and-mortar locations serve as a key place for customers to buy products on release days, get technical support and take classes.</p>
      <p>The company’s retail operations are overseen by Deirdre O’Brien, one of Apple’s longest-serving executives, who took over the duties when Burberry Group Plc veteran Angela Ahrendts left the role in 2019. Construction and upkeep of the stores themselves is managed by Kristina Raspe, Apple’s executive in charge of global real estate and facilities. That group reports to the company’s chief financial officer rather than O’Brien.</p>
      <p>Apple operates four types of retail outlets, according to internal specifications: a standard store within indoor malls, “Apple Store+” locations that can be in outdoor malls or on city streets, “flagships” in key areas with unique designs, and “flagship+” stores, which are the largest and most expensive to operate. Regular stores typically generate more than $40 million annually, while Apple Store+ locations bring in over $45 million, according to internal data. The flagships generate more than $75 million, while the flagship+ sites make over $100 million annually.</p>
      <p>The main focus of the expansion is the Asia-Pacific region, with 21 new or revamped sites planned through 2027. The market generated about $130 billion of Apple’s revenue last year — roughly a third of its total — and countries like India have emerged as a critical growth engine. Apple opened its first two stores in India in April.</p>
      <p>Later this year, the company is opening a new mall store in Wenzhou, China, upgrading its Nanjing East flagship in Shanghai and adding a pair of new outlets in South Korea. That expansion in South Korea, the home turf of chief rival Samsung Electronics Co., will bring the total number of outposts in the country to seven. Apple opened its Gangnam store in Seoul in March and its Myeongdong location a year ago.</p>
      <p>For next year, the company is planning its first store in Malaysia, located in Kuala Lumpur; the new Jing An Temple Plaza location; a remodel of its Pudong site in Shanghai; and potentially its first outpost in Foshan, China. It’s also planning a new store at the Grand Front Plaza mall in Osaka and a remodel of its Shinsaibashi location in the region.</p>
      <p>Even with US-China relations China souring, Apple remains highly dependent on the Asian nation — both as a manufacturing partner and a market for its goods. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook celebrated that relationship during a trip to China earlier this year, calling it “symbiotic,” and the retail growth underscores Apple’s commitment to the country.</p>
      <p>For 2025, Apple is discussing opening its third store in India — in the Borivali suburb of Mumbai — and may relocate its site in Perth, Australia. Four new China stores are proposed for that year as well, in addition to a remodel of Apple’s Ginza shop in Japan, which was the company’s first in the country when it opened in 2003. The store was relocated to a temporary space last year after its original building was demolished.</p>
      <p>Apple is proposing opening its fourth India location in 2026. It would be the second one in New Delhi, situated at the DLF Promenade mall. That store could become the second-largest for Apple in India, after the Bandra Kurla Complex site that debuted in Mumbai in April. The company is also laying the groundwork for a new store in Yokohama, Japan, and a relocated outlet in Shibuya Marui, Japan. In 2027, Apple aims to add a fifth Indian outpost, a location in the seaside Worli area in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>In Europe, Apple looks to open the London store in the Battersea location as soon as this month. The company is also planning a new store in Madrid at the La Vaguada shopping center, as well as a relocation for its Milton Keynes store in the UK. Europe generated more than $95 billion for Apple last year, or about a fourth of sales. The UK is Apple’s third-biggest retail market, home to about 40 stores.</p>
      <p>The locations that Apple is rebuilding or moving are mostly aging or outdated stores. In some cases, they’re smaller than most modern locations or they lack features like a product pickup area or seating for classes. Apple’s aesthetic also has changed over the years. The company has transitioned away from metal walls and accents to wooden shelves.</p>
      <p>More broadly, O’Brien is seeking to improve the experience in Apple stores. Complaints from both customers and employees have stacked up in recent years, and the chain has lost some of the cachet it enjoyed when Apple’s gleaming logo first began popping up in shopping centers two decades ago. The company also been dealing with a unionization push both in the US and abroad.</p>
      <p>For next year, Apple is discussing relocating four UK stores, as well as a location in Le Chesnay, France, and will open its fourth site in Sweden. A year later, it’s planning to relocate one more UK site, potentially remodel the Opera location in France and open a new location in Abu Dhabi’s Al Ain. That will mark its fifth store in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>Apple is also proposing a new store in Dortmund, Germany. That country is Apple’s eighth-largest retail region, featuring over a dozen sites. For 2027, it’s discussing a relocation in Munich.</p>
      <p>Apple’s retail plans in North America also are focused more on overhauling existing operations than spreading to new cities. First up is a revamp of the Tice’s Corner store in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, slated for next month. That location was Apple’s last with an original black front, dating from the chain’s debut in 2001. The company is planning three other US relocations and one Canada store move during the remainder of 2023.</p>
      <p>For next year, Apple is considering a few new US sites, including a mall store in the Southern California city of Torrance and a large new location at the $4 billion Worldcenter development in Miami. It is also discussing eventually opening a major new store in Detroit and a relocated store in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
      <p>Apple is planning a store at the Birkdale Village mall in North Carolina as well, replacing a Charlotte location that abruptly shuttered in March following a rash of shootings in the area. An additional five other relocations are being eyed for the US in 2024.</p>
      <p>In 2025, Apple is proposing opening its second outlet in Kansas, a large store in Wichita, and is planning three other US relocations. It’s also considering moving its Sainte-Catherine Street store in Montreal.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Share repurchase programs are very popular with investors -- especially one of the world's best.</p>
    	<p>When a company is highly profitable, it sometimes accumulates a pile of cash so large that it can't effectively reinvest it in the business. Therefore, it chooses to return money to shareholders instead.</p>	
    	<p>It can do so by paying a cash dividend or initiating a share repurchase (buyback) program. A buyback involves the company taking a sum of money (usually approved by its board of directors) and buying its own shares in the open market, just like any other investor. This shrinks the number of shares in circulation, organically increasing its price per share.</p>	
    	<h3>Here's how it works</h3>
      <p>If a company has 1 billion shares in circulation and trades at a price of $100 per share, it is worth $100 billion. If it spends $10 billion repurchasing its own stock, it could buy 100 million shares, reducing its share count to 900 million.</p>
      <p>But that doesn't change the underlying value of its business. Therefore, to maintain a $100 billion market capitalization, its stock price must organically rise to $111.11 to compensate for the smaller number of shares in circulation.</p>
      <p>Every remaining investor is now better off because of the higher stock price.</p>
      <h3>The largest technology companies in the world have done buybacks in 2023</h3>
      <p>Apple (AAPL 1.60%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.28%), Meta Platforms (META 2.98%), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.69%) (GOOG 0.81%) are all highly profitable companies, and they've each spent billions of dollars buying back their own shares this year.</p>
      <p>Here's how much they allocated to buybacks in the recent quarter alone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apple spent $19.6 billion on buybacks in its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended April 1), equivalent to about 0.7% of its outstanding shares. Apple's board of directors also authorized a brand-new $90 billion buyback program.</li>
        <li>Microsoft spent $4.9 billion on buybacks in its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended March 31), which was equivalent to about 0.2% of its outstanding shares. The company refreshes its buyback program every three years; it last authorized $60 billion in fiscal 2022, so this current program will end in fiscal 2025.</li>
        <li>Meta Platforms spent $9.2 billion on buybacks in the first quarter of 2023 (ended March 31), equivalent to about 1.7% of its outstanding shares. It has $41.3 billion remaining under its existing program.</li>
        <li>Alphabet spent $14.5 billion on buybacks in the first quarter of 2023 (ended March 31), equivalent to about 1.1% of its outstanding shares. The company also authorized a brand-new program worth $70 billion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Buybacks alone aren't a reason for investors to rush into a particular stock, but they are an added bonus. Famed investor Warren Buffett is a big fan of them; his Berkshire Hathaway investment company holds nearly 50 stocks and financial securities worth $333 billion, yet just one stock -- Apple -- makes up a whopping 47.5% of the entire portfolio.</p>
      <p>Buybacks are one of his favorite reasons to own Apple. In Berkshire's 2020 shareholder letter, Buffett commented that despite selling $11 billion worth of Apple stock that year, the firm's stake in the company had grown to 5.4% over time -- higher than it was (5.2%) when it originally accumulated the position from 2016 to 2018.</p>
      <p>How? Because every time Apple repurchases its stock, the remaining investors are left with a larger share of a shrinking pie (the pie being the number of shares in circulation).</p>
      <h3>Here's why you should buy Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet</h3>
      <p>Apple is the world's largest company today, with a value of $2.7 trillion. It has a strong product portfolio featuring the iPhone, iPad, AirPods wireless headphones, and the Mac line of computers and notebooks. But its services segment, which earns subscription-based revenue from platforms like Apple Music and Apple News, continues to be its main growth driver. When the broader economy bounces back from this difficult period, its hardware sales should find renewed strength.</p>
      <p>Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet are also rapidly progressing in a brand-new area: artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
      <p>Microsoft has invested in ChatGPT creator OpenAI this year and is integrating the chatbot into its product portfolio. It now powers Microsoft's Bing search engine, which could revolutionize how consumers access information on the internet. And customers of Microsoft's Azure cloud services platform can access the latest GPT-4 large language model, meaning the company could soon be a primary distributor of the most advanced AI tools to millions of businesses worldwide.</p>
      <p>Alphabet is building its own large language models for its Google search engine to fend off the growing threat from Microsoft Bing. Additionally, it's delivering proprietary AI solutions to its customers via the cloud.</p>
      <p>Finally, Meta is rapidly developing AI algorithms to more accurately feed content to users on its Instagram and Facebook social media platforms. Thanks to those efforts, the company saw a 24% year-over-year increase in the time users spent on Instagram in Q1 and much higher monetization efficiency.</p>
      <p>Overall, buybacks are just one reason to own a stake in these four companies -- and investors should certainly consider doing so.</p>

	    <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy have reached a tentative deal to raise the federal government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, ending a months-long stalemate, two sources familiar with the negotiations said on Saturday.</p>
	    <p>But the deal still faces a difficult path to pass through Congress before the United States runs out of money to pay its debts in early June.</p>	
	    <p>COMMENTS:</p>	
	    <p>THIERRY WIZMAN, GLOBAL FX AND INTEREST RATES STRATEGIST, MACQUARIE GROUP, NEW YORK</p>
      <p>"There is certainly going to be a relief in the fixed income markets. Where there were the most distortions from the uncertainty was in the credit markets and in the Treasury bill market... I think on Tuesday, when the market reopens in the U.S., we should see those two distortions fixed.</p>
      <p>"But what this doesn't solve, is that along the whole Treasury curve yields have gone up recently. And I think they went up in anticipation that there will be a lot of issuance of Treasury bonds and notes and bills in the next few weeks because the U.S. Treasury has to replenish its cash. And so, I think Treasury bond yields will stay high for a while that supply is absorbed.</p>
      <p>"And I think stocks can do okay, here. This was certainly one overhang over the stock market.</p>
      <p>"As far as the dollar goes, I'm inclined to think that it could strengthen the dollar a little bit because it will weaken the argument for de-dollarization. But not by much just a little bit more, because the dollar has already strengthened in the last few weeks quite a bit."</p>
      <p>AMO SAHOTA, DIRECTOR, KLARITYFX, SAN FRANCISCO</p>
      <p>"This will be pretty good for the market. I think it will keep the expectations still pretty red hot with how the Nasdaq has been performing. It will be good for equities.</p>
      <p>"I think it may also give more reason for the Fed to feel confident about trying to lift up rates again. I think the market may actually seize the opportunity to price in a little bit more tightening in June, if they think that all else being equal, the economy is still running pretty hot - we can see that. The lift up in tech sector in particular. Spending has been pretty robust as well.</p>
      <p>"I think this just holds the dollar up pretty well as well. I think, generally, everybody should be pretty happy with this, although we want to see what the what the color of the deal looks like. Initially, it looks like this is coming more from cuts right, which is really what the Republicans were pushing for.</p>
      <p>"And it’ll be important to see how long the deal is for, whether ... we're going to face these same issues again. Or whether those matters are going also going to be resolved with a long-term deal. I very, very much doubt it's a long term deal."</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Nvidia's insane stock rally Thursday put $184 billion into investors' pockets in one day. More notably: It pushed Nvidia stature in the S&P 500 past Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway — again.</p>
    	<p>hares of Nvidia (NVDA) surged more than 26% in a day following blowout earnings. That made the chip designer worth $939.3 billion overnight — a remarkably sized gain for a giant S&P 500 stock of this size. And Nvidia's value blasted past Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) as the fifth most-valuable stock in the S&P 500. Buffett's investment company is worth $702 billion.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia is just one example of how big-cap technology stocks are absolutely carrying the S&P 500 this year. Just this one stock accounts for 23% of the $2.6 trillion gained by S&P 500 investors this year. Berkshire Hathaway's gain this year only accounts for 0.8%.</p>	
    	<p>"Big Tech is back, and not a moment too soon for U.S. equity investors," said Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research.</p>
      <h3>You'd Be Losing Money If Not For Big S&P 500 Tech</h3>
      <p>You can thank megacap techs for the S&P 500's impressive gains this year. It's not just hyperbole.</p>
      <p>If you excluded the top eight S&P 500 stocks this year, the S&P 500 would be down 0.3% instead of being up nearly 8%, says Howard Silverblatt, index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. And the S&P 500 would be down 0.4% if you omitted the information technology and communication services sectors.</p>
      <p>Being in the wrong place in the S&P 500 this year is costly. More stocks in the S&P 500 (271) are down this year than are up. And some are total wipeouts. So far, 43 S&P 500 stocks are down 20% this year, while only three more than that are up 20% or more, Silverblatt found.</p>
      <p>Shares of Nvidia are up nearly 160% in 2023 so far.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Is Pushing Others Aside, Including Warren Buffett</h3>
      <p>Nvidia is more than pulling its weight in this year's tech-driven rally.</p>
      <p>It's the third-largest contributor to the S&P 500's gain this year. That's impressive if you consider it's still only the fifth most valuable company in the index. But thanks to its key position in the AI revolution, Nvidia is rising fast. This is the second time Nvidia pulled ahead of Berkshire Hathaway in terms of market value. It did it before in November 2021 until sinking back below in early 2022.</p>
      <p>But Nvidia is back. It's now only 23% behind Amazon.com's (AMZN) $1.2 trillion valuation. And it only needs to gain 64% to catch up with Alphabet (GOOGL). It might seem odd to call a 64% rally small, but Nvidia's business has a mountain of gusto behind it. Analysts think demand for chips to power AI systems will push Nvidia's earnings up 132% just this fiscal year.</p>
      <p>That's a stock Buffett probably wishes he owned right now.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stock futures edge lower as traders eye debt deal reports; Fed inflation gauge in focus as rate hike bets quicken; Costco lower after Q3 earnings miss on muted big ticket spending; U.S. Banks cut Fed borrowing, balance sheet shrinks and Debt ceiling deal nears as Biden, McCarthy focus on spending freeze.</p>
    	<p>Five things you need to know before the market opens on Friday May 26:</p>	
      <h3>1. -- Stock Futures Edge Lower As Traders Eye Debt Deal Reports</h3>
    	<p>Wall Street futures slipped lower Friday, while the dollar gave back gains against its global peers and Treasury bond yields nudged higher, as investors looked to a key inflation reading prior to the opening bell while tracking reports of a potential agreement on raising the debt ceiling.</p>	
    	<p>Bond yields have been marching higher for much of the week, with 2-year Treasury note yields touching at a two-and-a-half year peak of 4.522% in overnight trading, as investors price in a final Federal Reserve rate hike while looking to a conclusion on debt ceiling talks in Washington.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest that President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are close to agreeing a deal that would raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling for two years, while freezing most government spending at 2023 levels.</p>
      <p>A rush of funding from the Treasury to rebuild its depleted reserves -- estimated at around $500 billion -- which would likely follow a debt ceiling deal is expected to add further upward pressure to Treasury yields and potentially 'crowd out' demand for riskier assets as the new paper is taken down by domestic and international investors.</p>
      <p>Stronger-than-expected job market data, a firmer reading of first quarter GDP growth and positive signals from the housing market all point to solid near-term growth prospects, as well, even as the broader Treasury complex continues to price in the chances of a near-term recession, with 10-year note yields trading at 3.796%, some 76 basis points south of 2-year paper.</p>
      <p>The could put today's PCE Price Index data in sharp focus, as investors gauge the level of inflation pressures that linger in the domestic economy and assess their impact on the Fed's next policy decision.</p>
      <p>The CME Group's FedWatch is currently pricing in a 43.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in June, up from just 17.4% a week ago, with bets on a move higher in July pegged at around 66.4% should the Fed decide to pause.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies, was marked 0.15% lower in overnight trading at 104.098 ahead of the PCE inflation data at 8:30 am eastern time.</p>
      <p>Heading into the start of the trading day on Wall Street, futures tied to the S&P 500 were indicating a 7 point opening bell decline while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were priced for a 57 point move to the downside. The tech-focused Nasdaq was looking at a 1 point bump.</p>
      <p>European stocks edged higher, with the region-wide Stoxx 600 rising 0.3% in early Frankfurt trading while Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.09% as the pound rose to 1.2353 against the U.S. dollar.</p>
      <p>Overnight in Asia, the region-wide MSCI ex-Japan index was marked 0.66% higher into the close of trading while chip stocks helped Japan's Nikkei 225 to a 0.37% gain to close at a fresh 1990 high 30,8916.31 points following a softer-than-expected May inflation reading.</p>
      <h3>2. -- Fed Inflation Gauge In Focus As Rate Hike Bets Quicken</h3>
      <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE Price Index, is expected to ease only modestly in April, underscoring the central bank's concern that consumer price pressures will remain elevated even as the economic growth slows into the summer months.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish both headline and core readings of the PCE index, with the form likely to slow to an annualized rate of 3.9% from the 4.2% recorded in March.</p>
      <p>The closely-tracked core reading, which strips out volatile components such as food and energy, is expected to hold at 4.6%, with prices rising 0.3% on the month, according to the Street consensus forecast.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department's headline consumer price index, published earlier this month, showed inflation easing to 4.9%, the lowest in 2 years, but rising 0.4% on the month thanks in part to a 3% surge in national gasoline prices.</p>
      <h3>3. -- Costco Lower After Q3 Earnings Miss on Muted Big Ticket Spending</h3>
      <p>Costco Wholesale  (COST) - Get Free Report shares edged lower in pre-market trading as spending on big-ticket items slowed in the face of elevated inflation and an uncertain job market.</p>
      <p>Costco said diluted earnings for the three months ending on May 7 fell 7.6% from last year to $2.93 per share, with revenues rising 1.9% to $52.6 billion and membership fees up 6.1% to $1.04 billion. Overall sales of $53.65 billion were shy of analysts' forecasts of a $54.57 billion tally.</p>
      <p>Average daily transaction were down 3.5% in the U.S., and 4.2% worldwide over the quarter, Costco said, thanks in part to weakness in sales in bigger-ticker, non-discretionary food items.</p>
      <p>"This is the second quarter that we've seen that discussion of lower sales of big-ticket discretionary items," CFO Richard Galanti told investors on a conference call late Thursday. "So, all things being equal, we'll be comparing against easier compares six months from now."</p>
      <p>Costco shares were marked 0.3% lower in pre-market trading to indicate an opening bell price of $485.00 each.</p>
      <h3>4. -- U.S. Banks Cut Fed Borrowing, Balance Sheet Shrinks</h3>
      <p>U.S. banks slashed their borrowing from the Federal Reserve's various lending programs this week, suggesting stresses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and the sale of First Republic are beginning to unwind for regional lenders</p>
      <p>Banks borrowed just $4.2 billion from the Fed's main discount window over the seven-day period ending on May 17, according to Fed data, down from the $9 billion handed-out over the prior period and the lowest since early March.</p>
      <p>The Fed's "other credit" account, which has been used to allocate borrowing from First Republic Bank, which was sold to JPMorgan Chase  (JPM) - Get Free Report last month, and well as the cost of winding down other failed lenders, fell $15.9 billion to $192.6 billion.</p>
      <p>Borrowing from the Fed's new Bank Term Funding Program, which allows banks to exchange high-quality assets for one-year loans, was up $3.9 billion to $87 billion. The Fed's overall balance sheet, meanwhile, shrunk by around $21 billion to $8.486 trillion.</p>
      <h3>5. -- Debt Ceiling Deal Nears As Biden, McCarthy Focus On Spending Freeze</h3>
      <p>President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are on the verge of agreeing to a two-year deal that would raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling just days before the Treasury will be unable to spend cash to cover debt payments and government expenses.</p>
      <p>Multiple media reports suggest Biden and McCarthy are close to agreeing terms that would effectively freeze most currenting government spending at 2023 levels, although spending on military and veterans programs would be modestly increased.</p>
      <p>If agreed, the deal would have to find its way through a Republican-controlled Congress, which has broken for the Memorial Day weekend and won't return to Washington until late next week. The Senate, meanwhile, is not in session at all, and the Treasury has said it will run out of money on the so-called June 1 'x-date'.</p>
      <p>"We knew this would not be easy," McCarthy told reporters in Washington. "I don't think everybody's going to be happy at the end of the day. That's not how the system works."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Fitch Ratings placed the U.S.'s triple-A rating on 'negative watch', indicating the potential for a downgrade if Congress is unable to authorize the Treasury to continue spending -- and servicing debt payments -- after the so-called x-date.</p>

	    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks rose in morning trading on Wall Street Friday, led by more gains in technology stocks as another chipmaker reported strong demand related to artificial intelligence.</p>
	    <p>The S&P 500 rose 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 240 points, or 0.7%, at 33,003 as of 10:08 a.m. Eastern and the Nasdaq rose 1%.</p>	
	    <p>Technology stocks were the doing much of the heavy lifting for the benchmark S&P 500. Marvell Technology surged 25% after the chipmaker said it expects AI revenue in fiscal 2024 to at least double from the prior year. That follows Thursday’s report from fellow chipmaker Nvidia, which gave a big forecast for upcoming sales related to AI.</p>	
	    <p>Wall Street remains focused on Washington and ongoing negotiations for a deal to lift the U.S. government’s debt ceiling and avert a potentially calamitous default.</p>
      <p>Officials said President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy were narrowing in on a two-year budget deal that could open the door to lifting the nation’s debt ceiling. The Democratic president and Republican speaker hope to strike a budget compromise this weekend.</p>
      <p>The threat of the U.S. defaulting on its debt comes amid lingering concerns about a recession on the horizon amid inflation's grip on businesses and consumers. A key measure of inflation that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve ticked higher than economists expected in April. The report also showed that consumer spending remains strong.</p>
      <p>The persistent pressure from inflation complicates the Fed's fight against high prices. The central bank has been aggressively raising interest rates since 2022, but recently signaled it will likely forgo a rate hike when it meets in mid-June. The latest government report on inflation is raising concerns about the Fed's next move.</p>
      <p>Wall Street is now leaning slightly toward the potential for another quarter-point rate hike in June, according to CME's Fedwatch tool.</p>
      <p>Bond yields had been slipping just prior to the latest inflation data, but rose following the report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.82% from 3.78% just before the report was released.</p>
      <p>Movement for the two-year Treasury yield, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, was more extreme. It jumped to 4.58% from 4.49% prior to the report.</p>
      <p>Markets in Europe and Asia gained ground.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>China is the world's No. 2 economy and home to dozens of companies that trade in the U.S. Right now, Trip.com (TCOM),  Tesla (TSLA) rival BYD (BYDDF), Li Auto (LI) Vipshop (VIPS) and NetEase (NTES) are China stocks worth watching or potentially buying.</p>
    	<p>It's been a tough couple of years for Chinese stocks. The Covid pandemic, and Beijing's zero-Covid policy, have slammed the economy. Meanwhile, regulatory crackdowns vs. technology and data-centric firms such as Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and NetEase (NTES) have been a major headwind. The tech crackdown seems to have eased. But Covid restrictions have largely been rolled back, raising hopes for stronger growth as 2023 goes on.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. tensions are a concern. In recent months, the White House has barred shipments of key chip technology to China, adding to tariffs and other curbs on Chinese goods.</p>	
    	<p>But after a long stretch where it was difficult to find five top China stocks to buy or watch, a growing number of Chinese companies are setting up. Alibaba, Tencent, ZTO Express (ZTO) and Baidu (BIDU) are among others close to buy points.</p>
      <h3>BYD Stock</h3>
      <p>BYD is China's largest EV maker, and has recently become the country's biggest automaker period. It's also the largest maker of electric vehicles, including its high-mileage plug-in hybrids. It still lags Tesla in battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, but has narrowed the gap considerably.</p>
      <p>BYD reported Q1 net profit surged 411% vs. a year earlier, while revenue jumped nearly 80%. But actual earnings and sales were down substantially vs. Q4 2022. Some of that reflects a seasonally slow first quarter, with China New Year. Some of it reflects higher R&D spending. But it also reflects the impact of a fierce China EV price war.</p>	
    	<p>BYD didn't rush into the price war, though discounts and price cuts have picking up in recent weeks.</p>	
    	<p>BYD's April sales of 210,295 vehicles, were up slightly from March's 207,080, but still down substantially vs. December.</p>
      <p>Of the 209,467 personal vehicles, BYD sold 104,364 BEVs and 105,103 plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs).</p>
      <p>The automaker also likely is pinning its hopes on strong demand for new models, including the compact Seagull that will start at around $10,700.</p>	
    	<p>BYD now has EVs ranging from  just under $11,000 to $160,000.</p>	
    	<p>The EV giant is massively expanding its vehicle and battery production capacity. It's building a factory in Thailand. It's also going to build a plant in Vietnam, with speculation that plants in Brazil, Europe and Indonesia could follow.</p>
      <p>BYD stock cleared a 31.17 cup-with-handle base buy point and is moving higher in the 5% chase zone.</p>
      <p>BYD stock is listed in Hong Kong and trades over the counter in the U.S.</p>	
    	<p>Bottom line: BYDDF stock is a buy.</p>	
      <h3>Trip.com Stock</h3>
    	<p>Trip.com is a Chinese online travel firm, with operations in various countries.</p>
      <p>It's one of the biggest beneficiaries of China's reopening, with millions of people eager to travel within China and beyond.</p>
      <p>Trip.com's Q4 earnings rose 38% vs. a year earlier, defying views for a loss. Revenue fell 1%, also topping views. The company was bullish on travel, with analysts expected hot growth in 2023-2024.</p>	
    	<p>Q1 results are due May 24.</p>	
    	<p>Trip.com stock more than doubled from the October low of 19.25 to the Jan. 27 peak of 40.17.</p>
      <p>A base has formed with a 40.27 buy point. But shares have fallen below 50-day lines. The stock did recently find support near their 200-day and is trying to rebound.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: TCOM stock isn't a buy.</p>	
      <h3>Vipshop Stock</h3>
    	<p>Vipshop is a Chinese e-commerce site, specializing in discount, limited sales. Earnings have rebounded for the past three quarters but revenue has continued to fall.</p>	
    	<p>One issue for VIPS stock is that shares of its larger rivals, namely Alibaba, JD.com and PDD Holdings, are not acting well.</p>
      <p>VIPS stock briefly rallied above a 16.08 handle buy point in a three-month base, hitting a 52-week high. But shares tumbled back after Alibaba earnings, moving below the 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Vipshop earnings are due May 23.</p>	
    	<p>Bottom line: VIPS stock is not a buy.</p>	
      <h3>Li Auto Stock</h3>
    	<p>Li Auto makes premium hybrid SUVs, though it's moving down the price scale as it expands its lineup, with a non-SUV on the horizon.</p>
      <p>Li Auto is expanding rapidly and is already profitable. Consistent profits have been tricky, but with the end of Covid restrictions and production ramping up, Li Auto is set to see booming earnings in 2023 and 2024.</p>
      <p>On May 10, Li Auto reported first-quarter earnings surged 186% vs. a year earlier, far above views. Revenue spiked 96.5% to $2.74 billion. Already reported deliveries were 52,584, up 66%.</p>	
    	<p>For the second quarter, Li sees deliveries of 76,000-81,000. It's already reported a record 25,681 deliveries for April, up 23% vs. March.</p>	
    	<p>China's EV price war is a concern. While the price war is most intense at the 200,000-300,000 RMB segment, the premium segment is getting increasingly crowded. And Li Auto's move toward the mainstream market, while greatly expanding its target audience, also exposes itself to fierce competition.</p>
      <p>Li Auto unveiled its EV-only plans on April 18 at the Shanghai Auto show.</p>
      <p>From the Oct. 24 low of 12.52, LI stock more than doubled to 27.48 on Feb. 2. Shares then consolidated.</p>	
    	<p>Li briefly broke out of a double-bottom base in April, but that quickly failed. But on May 10, shares blasted past a new 26.37 early entry and 27.58 official buy point.</p>	
    	<p>Shares are now extended from the base. After surging in its breakout week, LI stock traded tightly the following week, showing some elements of a short-stroke pattern.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: LI stock is not a buy.</p>
      <h3>NetEase Stock</h3>
      <p>NetEase is a China mobile gaming giant.</p>	
    	<p>Q4 EPS fell 32% vs. a year earlier, while revenue dipped 4%.</p>	
    	<p>Q1 results are due on May 25.</p>
      <p>After running from 53.09 in late October to 93.19 in late January,</p>
      <p>After a consolidation, NTES stock briefly broke out on April 17, but that quickly failed. Shares have now forged a flat base next to that prior consolidation, with a new 95.09 buy point.</p>	
    	<p>Shares are above the 50-day line. Arguably there's an early entry from clearing a trendline and the May 15 high of 90.06, but the upcoming earnings report substantially raises the risks.</p>	
    	<p>Bottom line: NTES stock is not a buy.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Major US stock-market strategists are starting a bull-bear debate, with pessimist Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley warning that the latest rally is a head fake, while Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian raises her 2023 target for the S&P 500 Index.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Major US stock-market strategists are starting a bull-bear debate, with pessimist Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley warning that the latest rally is a head fake, while Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian raises her 2023 target for the S&P 500 Index.</p>
	    <p>Wilson was one of the few Wall Street strategists to see the 2022 meltdown coming, earning him the top spot in last year’s Institutional Investor magazine survey, and has remained one of the most bearish voices in the market even as the S&P rallied 9% to start 2023. At this point, he sees too many troubling triggers to believe the gains will stick.</p>	
	    <p>“Is this finally the breakout to confirm a new bull market?” Wilson wrote in a note to clients Monday. “The short answer is no.” In particular, he sees risks in lofty valuations, a narrow breadth of stocks driving the gains and the outperformance of defensive stocks.</p>	
	    <p>But where Wilson is looking at a half-empty glass, Subramanian says she sees a “half-full” one. She raised her 2023 year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 4,300 from 4,000. The equities benchmark topped 4,200 on Friday before drifting lower.</p>
      <p>“The era of easy money is behind us, but that might be a good thing,” she wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. “Corporate America has shifted focus to structural benefits — efficiency/automation/AI — and have bought themselves time to adapt via long-dated fixed-rate debt. Old economy cyclicals, capital-starved since 2008, have become disciplined and self-sufficient, evidenced by lower betas and more stable earnings.”</p>
      <p>History appears to be on Subramanian’s side, as a strong first 100 days in the S&P 500 typically means significant upside for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>One short-term risk for the market is the ongoing debate in Washington over raising the US debt ceiling. Wilson said a resolution in the negotiations may briefly drive stocks higher, but “we would view that as a false breakout/bull trap.”</p>
      <p>Others, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas are also warning about more market volatility as the talks drag on. President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are set to meet Monday.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Dow Jones futures rose slightly early Friday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.</p>
	    <p>Applied Materials (AMAT) headlined earnings reports Thursday night.</p>	
	    <p>The stock market rally continued to advance Thursday amid debt-ceiling deal hopes. Big techs dominated. The Nasdaq composite led, with the Nasdaq 100 powering to a 52-week high. The S&P 500 hit its best levels of the year. Thursday's gains were top heavy, but the Dow Jones and market breadth were mildly positive.</p>	
	    <p>Netflix (NFLX) and  Synopsys (SNPS) each leapt 9% Thursday and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) rocketed nearly 15%, all surging out of bases and past buy zones. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) made a powerful move and Dynatrace (DT) broke out.</p>
      <p>Nvidia (NVDA) spiked 5%, starting to go vertical ahead of earnings next week. ServiceNow (NOW) kept rising to just beyond a buy zone and is up 12% so far this week.</p>
      <p>There are buying opportunities, but resist FOMO.</p>
      <p>Don't chase stocks if they getting extended. A pullback in the broader market or in techs wouldn't be a surprise.</p>
      <p>More Federal Reserve speakers are on tap Friday, including Fed chief Jerome Powell.</p>
      <h3>Applied Materials Earnings</h3>
      <p>AMAT stock fell slightly in premarket trading after Applied Materials earnings topped fiscal Q2 views. The chip gear maker gave Q3 guidance with midpoints that topped consensus. Applied Materials stock rose 3.4% in Thursday's session to 129.92, moving above a 125.72 cup-base buy point. On Monday, AMAT stock cleared an early entry as it broke above the 50-day line. But the looming earnings made those entries risky.</p>
      <p>Fellow semiconductor equipment giants KLA Corp. (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) lost a fraction while ASML (ASML) edged higher. ASML stock broke out Thursday while LRCX stock is now extended. KLAC stock, which flashed an early entry on Monday, ran up toward an official buy point but is extended from its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Separately, Foot Locker (FL) plunged after the athletic shoe and apparel retailer missed Q1 views and slashed full-year guidance. Nike (NKE) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) fell modestly.</p>
      <p>ASML stock and Nvidia are on IBD Leaderboard. LRCX stock and Cadence Design are on SwingTrader. KLAC stock, Cadence Design and Synopsys are IBD Long-Term Leaders. NOW stock is on the IBD 50. ServiceNow and CDNS stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in the article highlighted Thursday's tech-led market rally and analyzed Cadence Design, ASML and NFLX stock.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures rose more than 1%. So did copper futures.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>Large tech stocks dominated Thursday's stock market rally, but the major indexes all advanced.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index popped 0.9%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.6%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.3% to $71.86 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield popped 7 basis points to 3.65%, a two-month high. The U.S. dollar continued its big run over the past couple of weeks, hitting a two-month high.</p>
      <p>Stronger economic data, along with easing banking and U.S. debt-ceiling fears, is reviving the possibility of further Fed rate hikes. Fed policymakers continued to signal they're not ready to declare a halt. The odds of a June 14 rate hike have climbed to 36% on Thursday from 28% on Wednesday and 11% a week earlier. The odds kept rising early Friday.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) jumped 2.4%. ServiceNow stock is a big IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) leapt 3.5%. AMAT stock and Nvidia are big SMH holdings, along with ASML, LRCX and KLAC.</p>
      <p>Cadence Design Systems and SNPS stock are in IGV and SMH.</p>
      <p>Reflecting stocks with more speculative stories, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) climbed 1.4% and ARK Genomics (ARKG) advanced 0.7%. Ark Invest disclosed it bought 1.26 million PLTR shares on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) dipped 0.2%. U.S. Global Jets (JETS) ascended 0.3%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) climbed 1.7%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) advanced 0.7%, and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) dipped 0.2%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 0.7%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 0.6%.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally advanced Thursday but remains reliant on big-cap tech. The Nasdaq composite ran to nine-month highs. The Nasdaq 100, which includes the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq components, shot up past its August peak to hit a 52-week high.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 ran up to clear its February and May peaks, hitting its best levels since last August.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones retreated for much of the session, but rallied late to top its 21-day line.</p>
      <p>Winning stocks outpaced losers Thursday, though not by much, especially on the Nasdaq. New highs outpaced new lows, in the best showing in weeks.</p>
      <p>The equal-weight ETFs were encouraging. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) jumped 1.6%, following Wednesday's 1.2% move from near the 50-day line. That reflects strength in big-cap chip and software names beyond the megacaps.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) climbed 0.8%, closing above its 50-day and 200-day lines for the first time since May 1. But RSP is a long way from its 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 by some measures may be due for a pullback, though that doesn't have to happen overnight. Many tech stocks, including Nvidia, look extended and could use a breather. Others — such as ServiceNow, Synopsys and Palantir — appear extended from a buying perspective.</p>
      <p>A stronger dollar and higher Treasury yields should be a negative, especially for highly valued growth stocks, but that hasn't hit techs recently.</p>
      <p>Can the Nasdaq 100 pull the rest of the market higher, with gains broadening out? That's what happened on Thursday.  Or will the broad market drag down big-cap techs?</p>
      <p>Adding to the uncertainty, the market faces rotation in macro concerns. For months, Wall Street was obsessed with inflation and Fed rate hikes. Then it switched to banking fears and recession risk, with maybe some debt-ceiling concerns recently. Now there's a bit of a shift back to Fed worries, as well as a stronger dollar.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>If you're in Nvidia, Palantir, ServiceNow and other big winners, you may be getting exuberant. Have a strategy for taking profits, either on the way up or down.</p>
      <p>If you're watching big winners fly by, you'll feel the pull of FOMO. Keep your emotions in check and stick to your rules.</p>
      <p>Whatever you do, don't chase extended stocks, especially now.</p>
      <p>Have your watchlists ready, paying special attention to a select group of names that are close to breakouts. Set alerts. Doing this work ahead of time means you'll be ready to act when stocks do flash buy signals.</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - Shares in Nvdia Corp, Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology on Thursday provided the biggest boosts to the chip sector, which outperformed the broader market as investors looked for ways to invest in artificial intelligence and in Japan.</p>
	    <p>Shares in chip design software company Synopsys shares ended up 8.7% after it forecast better-than-expected third-quarter profit estimates, saying increased use of AI and automation boosted its business.</p>	
	    <p>Nvidia shares were up 5.0%, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 3.2%.</p>	
     	<p>Micron's shares climbed 4.1% after announcing it would invest up to 500 billion yen ($3.70 billion) in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology in Japan in the next few years with Japanese government support.</p>
      <p>Japan's President Fumio Kishida asked executives from companies, such as Micron, Intel Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), to invest in Japan ahead of a three-day Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, where member countries will discuss what they see as China's economically coercive policies and its accumulation of sensitive technology.</p>
      <p>Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh put Thursday's rally down to continued investor interest in the emergence of artificial intelligence as the hottest new technology, more so than the news from Japan.</p>
      <p>"While it's encouraging that companies and countries are working together to expand capacity, for investors when companies are building new plants, it's generally not rewarding in the short term because that's where all the free cash flow goes," said Forrest.</p>
      <p>The money manager, who also cited Synopsys results as a positive sign for the chip sector, however, noted that investors see chips as the part of the AI story they can buy into today as "there's no one company you can buy that's the lynchpin" for AI.</p>
      <p>AMD shares were up 4.0% while Intel added 2.8%. Nvidia, which is up 116% so far in 2023, is due to report quarterly results on May 24.</p>
      <p>Nvidia shares hit highest level since December 2021 while Micron shares touched highest point since June 2022.</p>
      <p>Trailing behind the chip sector, the S&P 500 technology index was up 2.1% and the S&P 500 growth index rose at a slower 1.0% pace.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- More than three years after China’s grand financial opening, it’s becoming clear to Wall Street giants that their dreams of windfall profits from the $60 trillion market are more elusive than ever.</p>
    	<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are among banks scaling back ambitious expansion plans and profit goals as a deteriorating geopolitical climate and the increasingly authoritarian direction of President Xi Jinping rock the private sector and throttle dealmaking. More drastic jobs cuts are being eyed at the biggest banks, according to senior executives who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.</p>	
    	<p>Goldman Sachs, which was ahead of targets in 2021 after revenue surged, has revised projections on its five-year plan after the country’s business environment drastically changed. Morgan Stanley is opting not to build an onshore brokerage for now, making a smaller bet of about $150 million on derivatives and futures businesses. The firm is planning another round of job cuts affecting 7% of its Asia-Pacific investment bankers as soon as this week, people familiar said, joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and rivals in reducing China-dedicated headcount earlier this year.</p>	
    	<p>The moves mark an about face for many of the Wall Street giants, which as recently as 18 months ago were sticking to plans to take on China’s massive banks on their home turf and were more concerned about finding enough local talent to drive the expansion. For many firms, there’s now a realization that they need a fundamental rethink on the world’s No. 2 economy because the business climate has weakened significantly and the best opportunities for making outsized profits in the country are over, according to the senior executives.</p>
      <p>``This changing calculus makes the cost of doing business in China higher and the rewards much lower,’’ said finance professor Mark Williams at Boston University. ``These global banks are vulnerable to political actions that could inflict material financial harm to their franchises and to shareholders.’’</p>
      <p>While many banks are eliminating jobs globally, the cuts in China are the biggest in years and in many cases are relatively deeper than the rest of the world, the people said. China’s economy is struggling to get back on its feet after years of Covid restrictions and crackdowns on everything from financial technology to private education and real estate. In all, at least 100 China-focused jobs were lost since September. Goldman alone let go of more than a 10th of its workforce on the mainland after doubling headcount to over 600 to build up its business, the people said.Representatives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</p>
      <p>More Pessimism</p>
      <p>China has enacted the most sweeping changes in decades for its financial services, allowing foreign firms full ownership of insurers, banks, brokers and asset managers as President Xi seeks to cushion the economy from the steepest slowdown since the early 1990s amid a trade dispute with the US. Yet the country’s state-owned players are well-entrenched across all these segments after learning from their joint venture partners for years, making it hard for global firms to compete.</p>
      <p>“The Chinese banks totally dominate the market,” said Dick Bove, a long-time bank analyst and chief financial strategist at Odeon Capital Group in New York, adding the domestic firms now have “little need for American expertise.”</p>
      <p>The stakes are high for the international banks in a market long viewed as the final frontier for big fees on everything from mergers to stocks sales and trading. JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley had combined China exposure of $48 billion in 2022, though that’s down 16% from the previous year. The banks have spent more than $4 billion in recent years upping or acquiring controlling stakes in their securities and asset management joint ventures, banking on future growth, according to Bloomberg calculations.</p>
      <p>The backdrop of a more fractured geopolitical landscape means Wall Street firms have to strike an increasingly delicate balance. Publicly, everyone’s saying the same thing: China is still a massive opportunity and they have no plans to pull out, especially since so much money has already been spent. Privately, Wall Street executives are saying it’s difficult to maintain good standing with both sides as tensions repeatedly flare. That could get tougher as the US election cycle approaches — China policy is poised to be a major topic on both sides of the political aisle, all but guaranteeing more drama.</p>
      <p>As a result, bank executives are increasing scrutiny of credit and market risks, peppering senior managers in Asia with questions on their liquidity and the potential for clients to be ensnared by US sanctions, the people said. The further away bankers sit from China, the more pessimistic they are, they added.</p>
      <p>"Wall Street banks should have factored in geopolitical risks a long time ago," said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong Business School. “Over the next five years, the best case scenario for them is that China reverses direction and goes back to real open-door policy and market reforms, revitalizing the business environment. This is an extremely unlikely scenario but not impossible.”</p>
      <p>The uncertain outlook has prompted Morgan Stanley to pursue China business out of Hong Kong for years and the financial hub will continue to be the main beachhead even as it builds out some onshore bank and asset management units and applies for research and market-making licenses, the people said. China accounted for less than half of the bank’s investment-banking revenue from Asia-Pacific last year, compared with about 60% in previous years, a person familiar said.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street firms face headwinds on several fronts. The biggest revenue driver over the past decades — taking Chinese firms public in New York — has all but dried up. Xi has tightened listing rules to keep companies at home while the US has cracked down on Chinese firms over accounting. That’s put initial public offerings on hold and prompted some bellwether stocks such as PetroChina Co. and the two largest airlines to seek delistings in New York.</p>
      <p>Overseas Chinese equity deals slumped to just $19 billion in 2022, a far cry from more than $120 billion in 2020 and 2021, when banks including UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Goldman topped the rankings. While deals are starting to pick up again, bankers said many listings can’t be executed because investors are reluctant to pay up while Chinese firms are unwilling to sell low, according to senior staff handling the offerings.</p>
      <p>Global banks have also made few inroads into the highly competitive domestic market. Goldman ranked 13th for arranging stock sales in China last year, trailing 12 local banks. The offshore bond market, once a key driver of fees for underwriters like HSBC Holdings Plc and Goldman, has cratered after defaults by many China property firms.</p>
      <p>Chinese investment abroad, another source of advisory fees, has also slowed. Chinese companies announced just $44 billion in deals last year, the lowest since 2008 and a fraction of the $233 billion peak in 2016, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, foreign companies are facing increased scrutiny with authorities — concerned over the flow of sensitive information — raiding consultancies that conduct due diligence for global investors. Beijing has also urged its state-owned enterprises to gradually sever relationships with the Big Four accounting firms over data security concerns. Most recently, investors have been spooked as a number of financial data companies, including Wind Information Co., stopped providing detailed information on Chinese companies to overseas clients.</p>
      <p>Not Priority</p>
      <p>Given the tensions, China is no longer a top-three investment priority for a majority of US firms, according to an American Chamber of Commerce business climate survey published this year. Investors including Warburg Pincus have trimmed China dealmaking teams while private equity stalwarts such as Carlyle Group Inc. and PAG are finding it hard to raise new funds in the region. Two Canadian pension funds recently paused direct investments in China due to the geopolitical risks.On the asset management side, firms like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity International are pressing ahead to expand their fledgling onshore operations, though rival Vanguard Group Inc. plans to shutter its remaining business in China, and Van Eck Associates Corp. has pulled back.</p>
      <p>The deteriorating environment comes even as officials in Beijing have talked up the need for foreign investment as the economy struggles to regain traction after the lengthy Covid disruptions. Premier Li Qiang — the No. 2 behind Xi — vowed in March to establish a “broad space” for international companies to develop, while a top securities regulator reaffirmed the country’s commitment to opening its capital markets in a meeting with leaders of 10 international firms including Goldman Sachs and Bridgewater Associates.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan meanwhile is gearing up to host three conferences in Shanghai this month, including the China New Economy Forum and the Global China Summit, with Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon scheduled to attend, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>At a March gala dinner in Shanghai, JPMorgan’s Asia CEO Filippo Gori told more than 1,000 staff that “the business may slow down this year, but please ignore the noise and stories, and stay focused on what we are looking to achieve in China over the long term."</p>
      <p>For Williams at Boston University, the best case for Wall Street is for China and the US to tone down the rhetoric and allow for a more friendly environment.</p>
      <p>``This is not a likely scenario,’’ he said. ``Both sides are sitting tight with banks caught in an untenable vice grip.’’</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Nvidia (NVDA) is a giant in data centers and gaming, with AI chips a growth opportunity. Is Nvidia stock a buy after nearly doubling so far this year?</p>
    	<p><strong>Semiconductor, AI News</strong></p>	
    	<p>On May 1, Evercore analysts called Nvidia a "top pick" in a note to clients. Rosenblatt Securities analysts also named NVDA among seven chip stocks that could benefit from higher tech spending around artificial intelligence (AI).</p>	
    	<p>In March, chipmaker Nvidia announced various initiatives to broaden its reach in AI, including partnerships and new products.</p>
      <p>In February, Nvidia delivered a beat-and-raise report driven by its data center segment, which includes AI chips.</p>
      <p>In the tech industry's fierce battle for AI dominance, the advanced chips needed for "generative AI" such as the ChatGPT chatbot are key.</p>
      <p>For those looking for top large-cap stocks to buy now, here's a deep dive into NVDA stock.</p>
      <p><strong>Nvidia Stock Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>On May 1, Nvidia stock topped a 281.20 buy point from a three-weeks-tight pattern. The buy range goes to 295.26. Shares have moved sideways since the latest breakout, trading just above the entry on May 12.</p>
      <p>Investors could use the follow-on entry to start a small position or to grow an existing stake. However, the current market trend suggests a cautious approach to investing.</p>
      <p>IBD named Nvidia its Stock of the Day on May 1 as the chipmaker broke out.</p>
      <p>The chip stock earns a spot on the prestigious IBD Leaderboard. In April, NVDA stock hit the 20% profit-taking goal from a previous breakout.</p>
      <p>Year to date, Nvidia shares are up 92.4% after crashing in 2022.</p>
      <p>NVDA earns an IBD Composite Rating of 97. In other words, Nvidia stock has outperformed 97% of all other stocks in IBD's database in terms of combined technical and fundamental metrics.</p>
      <p>Investors generally should focus on stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or even 95 and above. Nvidia stock often earns a spot on the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders lists.</p>
      <p>The relative strength line made a new high May 1 as the semiconductor stock broke out.</p>
      <p>The RS line is almost back near November 2021 highs, the IBD MarketSmith charts show. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500. It is the blue line in the chart shown.</p>
      <p>The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that NVDA carries a Relative Strength Rating of 97. That means it has outperformed 97% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year.</p>
      <p>The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) holds both Nvidia stock and AMD stock.</p>
      <p><strong>Nvidia Earnings</strong></p>
      <p>Nvidia's EPS Rating is 63 out of 99 and its SMR Rating is a B, on a scale of A to a worst E. The EPS rating compares a company's earnings growth to other stocks. Its SMR Rating gauges sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.</p>
      <p>On Feb. 22, Nvidia beat Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal fourth quarter and guided higher for the current period.</p>
      <p>The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned 88 cents a share on sales of $6.05 billion. Year over year, Nvidia earnings dropped 33% while sales sank 21%.</p>
      <p>Data center revenue rose 11% to $3.62 billion, fueled by demand for AI chips. However, gaming chip sales remained weak, falling 46% to $1.83 billion.</p>
      <p>For the full year, Nvidia earnings fell 25% per share on basically flat revenue.</p>
      <p>The chip firm next reports earnings on May 24, for its fiscal first quarter. Analysts expect another weak quarter, but they then see Nvidia earnings rebounding 37% for the entire year, on an 11.6% sales gain.</p>
      <p>Out of 46 analysts covering NVDA stock, 34 rate it a buy. Twelve have a hold and no one has a sell, according to FactSet.</p>
      <p><strong>NVDA Backstory, Rivals</strong></p>
      <p>The fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video games more realistic. It's expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data centers and drug development.</p>
      <p>Nvidia's GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by other companies.</p>
      <p>In addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.</p>
      <p>Nvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.</p>
      <p>Fabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).</p>
      <p>Currently, the fabless group ranks No. 45 out of 197 industry groups.</p>
      <p>For the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the market and their own industry group.</p>
      <p><strong>Is Nvidia Stock A Buy?</strong></p>
      <p>On a fundamental level, Nvidia earnings and sales are expected to rebound this year.</p>
      <p>The chipmaker is expanding in growth areas such as data centers, including artificial intelligence, or AI; automated electric cars, and cloud gaming. The adoption of the metaverse and cryptocurrencies could further stoke demand for Nvidia chips.</p>
      <p>However, macroeconomic uncertainties and risk of global recession linger.</p>
      <p>NVDA stock has staged a strong comeback in 2023. Shares are within buy range following their latest breakout on May 1. The chip giant has raced higher this year amid investor enthusiasm about its AI leadership.</p>
      <p>Bottom line: Nvidia stock is a buy. As a leading chipmaker with exposure to top end-markets, Nvidia is always one to watch.</p>

    	<p>US stocks traded mostly lower on Thursday after fresh economic data reignited fears of a potential recession.</p>
    	<p>Weekly jobless claims surged by 22,000 to 264,000, hitting the highest level since October 2021 and topping economists' estimates for 245,000. It continues a recent trend of the unemployment claims ticking higher as more companies reduce their headcounts or slow down hiring.</p>

    	<p>Banking fears were renewed after PacWest said its deposit base shrank by nearly 10% last week, following a report that said it was considering a sale. The troubled bank stock plunged by more than 20% and helped drag down the Regional Banking sector ETF by 2%.</p>

    	<h3>By Sarupya Ganguly</h3>
    	<p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields will rise significantly over the coming month, according to analysts polled by Reuters who were split over whether the risk of a U.S. default was higher or the same as prior stand-offs over the debt ceiling.</p>
    	<p>President Joe Biden and top lawmakers in Congress have about three weeks to strike a deal over raising the $31.4 trillion U.S. debt limit, which has sharply increased volatility in bond markets.</p>	
    	<p>Half of the 28 respondents in the May 5-11 Reuters poll said the risk of a default was higher this time compared to prior episodes of debt ceiling brinkmanship. The rest said the risk was the same.</p>	
    	<p>Previous stand-offs have typically resulted in last-minute arrangements, but in 2011 the top-notch U.S. credit rating was downgraded for the first time. Analysts, however, warned that the current situation may be riskier owing to widening political divides.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, elevated worries about a default are set to push Treasury yields higher. U.S. 2-year and 10-year yields are forecast to rise over the coming month by around 20 and 10 basis points, respectively, the poll showed.</p>
      <p>Asked in what range the 10-year yield, currently at 3.38%, would trade over the coming month, the median response from strategists who were polled was 3.30%-3.60%. Individual responses ranged from as low as 3.0% to as high as 4.0%.</p>
      <p>"The balance of risks has moved decisively in a negative direction this week, with the Treasury Secretary providing a June 1 deadline for the debt ceiling, while stresses in the regional banking sector continue to weigh on markets," noted Phoebe White, U.S. rates strategist at J.P. Morgan.</p>
      <p>"While a short-term solution to buy time until the fall could be an option, it's hard to know whether even this type of stop-gap measure could get enough votes."</p>
      <p>Uncertainty over whether the debt ceiling will be raised on time, along with lingering worries around small to mid-sized U.S. banks, has added pressure to an already-turbulent Treasury market this year.</p>
      <p>Yields on short-dated Treasury bills, the most sensitive to debt ceiling jitters, and the cost of insuring against a U.S. sovereign default have both surged in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The most widely-followed indicator of bond market volatility, the MOVE index, is currently roughly 45% higher than its long-term average.</p>
      <p>Looking further ahead, the U.S. 2-year note yield was expected to fall sharply to 3.30% from the current 3.86% by April 2024, still just slightly higher than the 10-year note yield.</p>
      <p>Financial markets are pricing in at least 50 basis points of interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve by the end of 2023, suggesting a resilient economy and a strong labor market will give in to recession this year.</p>
      <p>But the Fed, which last week signaled a pause to one of its most aggressive tightening campaigns in history, pushed back on speculation that will soon consider cutting rates as inflation still runs more than twice the 2% target.</p>
      <p>"The key question ... for the second half of this year is whether the bond market is correct in its assumption the Fed will be forced to reverse policy and cut several times by early 2024," said Steven Ricchiuto at Mizuho Securities.</p>
      <p>"In contrast, our analysis suggests the Fed's 'higher for longer' strategy is more realistic."</p>

    	<p>Dow Jones futures rose modestly in a tightly mixed overall market early Monday. Key inflation data and Disney earnings are on tap for this week. Embattled regional bank PacWest (PACW) soared after cutting its dividend. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) cut its losses after Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is not seeking full control of the energy group.</p>
    	<p>Regional banks looked to add to Friday's gains, as the SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) climbed 2.2% early Monday. Late Friday, PacWest announced it was cutting its dividend in order to protect its balance sheet. Shares surged more than 35% Monday. Western Alliance (WAL) rallied 11% in morning trade.</p>	
    	<p>On the economic front this week, the consumer price index for April is out at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Inflation data will be keenly watched throughout May, after the Federal Reserve last week hinted at a possible pause, in June, to the rate-hike regimen that is slowing inflation but aggravating financial sector instability. Regulators said they "will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy."</p>	
    	<p>Key earnings reporters this week include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Trade Desk (TTD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).</p>
      <p>Lam Research (LRCX), IBD Leaderboard stock HubSpot (HUBS), Nvidia (NVDA) and Paccar (PCAR) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Nike (NKE) and Visa (V) — are among the best stocks to watch in the struggling stock market uptrend.</p>
      <p>Nvidia was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day topic. Nike received an IBD Stock Analysis last week, while Paccar also got an IBD Stock Analysis treatment recently.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) has a commanding lead in the streaming video market but its growth has slowed. NFLX stock cratered in 2022 after the company reported two straight quarters of subscriber declines. However, after a corporate course correction, some people might be wondering: Is Netflix stock a buy right now?</p>
    	<p>Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix started in 1997 as a subscription DVD-by-mail service in the U.S. That innovative service ultimately drove movie rental giant Blockbuster out of business. But Netflix announced April 18 that it is ending the legacy DVD service this fall.</p>	
    	<p>In 2007, Netflix began offering a streaming video service with licensed movies and TV series. It later entered the content production business and released its first major original series, "House of Cards," in February 2013.</p>	
    	<p>Netflix offers its subscription video-on-demand service in over 190 countries.</p>
      <h3>Subscriber Growth Drives Netflix Story</h3>
      <p>Netflix stock has benefited from the cord-cutting trend as people quit traditional pay-TV services.</p>
      <p>Over the last several years, Netflix has been laser-focused on growing its global subscriber base. It wants to build a competitive moat with scale. It has been investing heavily in local-language original content production worldwide. Netflix stock performance is linked to its net subscriber additions.</p>
      <p>In the first quarter, Netflix added 1.75 million new subscribers worldwide, vs. forecasts for 2.2 million. It ended the first quarter with 232.5 million total subscribers worldwide.</p>
      <p>Netflix stock dropped 3.2% on the first trading day after it posted first-quarter results late April 18.</p>
      <h3>Netflix Stock Fundamental Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the March quarter, Netflix earned $2.88 a share on sales of $8.16 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Netflix to earn $2.86 a share on sales of $8.18 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Netflix earnings fell 18% while sales climbed 4%.</p>
      <p>For the second quarter, Netflix predicted earnings of $2.84 a share on sales of $8.24 billion. But Wall Street had been projecting earnings of $3.07 a share on sales of $8.47 billion for the June quarter. In the year-earlier period, Netflix earned $3.20 a share on sales of $7.97 billion.</p>
      <p>After a humbling performance in 2022, Netflix says it is focused on profitability. It also hopes to increase its revenue with a lower-priced, advertising-supported service tier. Plus, it is looking to monetize rampant account sharing on the service and turn freeloaders into paying customers.</p>
      <p>The next catalyst for Netflix stock could be the company's second-quarter earnings report, due in late July.</p>
      <h3>Netflix Content Draws Subscribers</h3>
      <p>Since it started its original content push, Netflix has launched quite a few hit shows. They include "Stranger Things," "Squid Game," "Ozark," "Outer Banks" and "Bridgerton."</p>
      <p>It also has premiered popular original movies such as "Bird Box," "Extraction," "Murder Mystery," "The Old Guard" and "The Gray Man."</p>
      <p>Recent buzzworthy shows on Netflix include TV series "Wednesday," "The Night Agent" and "The Diplomat." Popular new original movies include "Don't Look Up," "Red Notice" and "Glass Onion."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Netflix is facing competition from traditional media companies. HBO Max from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) launched in May 2020. Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal followed in July 2020 with Peacock. Paramount Global (PARA) launched Paramount+ in March 2021.</p>
      <p>Other services include Amazon (AMZN) Prime Video, Apple's (AAPL) Apple TV+, Walt Disney's (DIS) Disney+, Hulu and more.</p>
      <h3>Netflix Enters Video Game Market</h3>
      <p>To create a stickier service, Netflix added mobile video games as part of its subscription offering in November 2021. Subscribers can play the games on Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets.</p>
      <p>Since September 2021, Netflix has purchased four game studios. It bought Night School Studio, Next Games, Boss Fight Entertainment and Spry Fox. It also has opened two new game studios.</p>
      <p>Netflix currently offers more than 50 games to subscribers. They include action, arcade, puzzle, racing, sports and casino games.</p>
      <h3>Netflix Stock Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>On Oct. 19, Netflix stock broke out of a nine-week consolidation period at a buy point of 252.09, according to IBD MarketSmith charts. NFLX stock ended the regular session on May 5 at 322.76.</p>
      <p>Netflix hit its record high of 700.99 in November 2021.</p>
      <p>Netflix stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 93 out of 99. The rating shows how a stock's price performance stacks up against all other stocks over the last 52 weeks.</p>
      <p>It has an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.</p>
      <h3>Is Netflix Stock A Buy Right Now?</h3>
      <p>Netflix stock is not a buy right now, but it soon could be. It has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 349.90, MarketSmith charts show.</p>
      <p>In a positive sign, NFLX stock has found support at its 50-day moving average line.</p>
      <p>Netflix stock ranks second out of 21 stocks in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The group ranks No. 37 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Growth stock investors should focus on leading stocks in top 40 industry groups.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Markets may have just survived the last of the most aggressive rate hikes in four decades. Few on Wall Street are celebrating.</p>
    	<p>If Wednesday’s quarter-point hike marked the peak of the cycle in the US, as market-implied odds suggest, the prospects for risk assets look glum. That’s in sharp contrast to the prior seven tightening cycles, where the final hike has almost always driven rallies in stocks and riskier credit. The one exception came at the end of the dot-com era in 2000 when recession pressures were beginning to build in the economy.</p>	
    	<p>What’s different now is that swaps traders expect the Federal Reserve’s next move will not be an extended pause, but instead a rate cut, perhaps as soon as July. Such a U-turn to easy policy suggests a recession that will force the central bank’s hand. Add beaten-down US regional bank stocks and tepid profit forecasts from Corporate America into the mix, and the outlook is grim.</p>	
    	<p>Even if the US can avoid a downturn, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are having a difficult time envisioning what will drive share prices higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has surged 21% this year and trades at around 25 times earnings. High-risk corporate credit is also up, adding 3.9%.</p>
      <p>“Historically what you’d do is buy the last hike, because normally you see the market rally from there,” said Nadia Lovell, a senior equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. But now “you have inflation that is still high, you have concerns within the banking system and some fragility around there. We think that the outcome is going to be just different this time.”</p>
      <p>Strategists at Wall Street’s largest banks are similarly pessimistic:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Morgan Stanley predicts the S&P 500 will decline to 3,900 by the end of the year as the economy slows</li>
        <li>Goldman Sachs sees no post-pause gains for US stocks in the second half, forecasting the S&P 500 will end the year at 4,000</li>
        <li>Bank of America Corp. strategists urge investors to “sell the last rate hike” and also see the S&P 500 rounding out the year at 4,000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many risk assets have already priced in a turn in Fed policy — but not the economic damage that may come along with such a pivot.</p>
      <p>“Markets are usually pricing the cuts before the recession is happening, but there are often false signals and current priced cuts appear too large,” said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, head of asset allocation research at Goldman Sachs.</p>
      <p>Still, it’s easy to understand why some investors have remained upbeat. US stocks have rallied following the end of six out of the past seven rate-hiking cycles and have delivered an average return of 13% over the next six months as fixed income has reaped gains.</p>
      <p>“Poor performance after the last hike, when the curve is inverted, is often driven by a sharp deceleration in growth and earnings,” said Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley. “We think those risks exist today.”</p>
      <p>In 2000, even after the Fed began cutting rates, risk assets in that cycle took years to recover as companies worked down their leverage and excess investments from the late 1990s.</p>
      <p>Corporate balance sheets are in better shape this time, but the bond market is signaling impending recession. Virtually the entire Treasury curve is inverted, a reliable harbinger of an economic slide.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley strategists recommend investment-grade fixed income. High-grade credit has posted gains after every Fed pause since 1984 and delivered an average return of 9.6%.</p>
      <p>But inflation remains stubbornly high and that will pressure profits.</p>
      <p>“We have almost three rate cuts priced in for the second half and at the same time our forecasts point to higher headline inflation and stickier core inflation in in the second half,” said Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC. “This is a dilemma that is virtually unsolvable — one of these will very likely prove wrong.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, expectations for steep rate cuts are building. Swap contracts linked to Fed meeting dates have been tumbling as markets are pricing in around 70 basis points of cuts by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“We can’t see how the Fed would be cutting rates in the absence of a meaningful slowdown in the US economy,” said Johanna Kyrklund, chief investment officer at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., who is bearishly positioned on US equities. “Something has to give.”</p>

    	<p>With the failure of three regional banks since March, and another one teetering on the brink, will America soon see a cascade of bank failures?</p>
    	<p>Bloomberg reported Wednesday that San Francisco-based PacWest Bancorp is mulling a sale.</p>	
    	<p>Last week, First Republic Bank became the third bank to collapse, the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history after Washington Mutual, which collapsed in 2008 amid the financial crisis.</p>	
    	<p>After the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, a study on the fragility of the U.S. banking system found that 186 more banks are at risk of failure even if only half of their uninsured depositors (uninsured depositors stand to lose a part of their deposits if the bank fails, potentially giving them incentives to run) decide to withdraw their funds.</p>
      <p>Uninsured deposits are customer deposits greater than the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance limit.</p>
      <p><strong>Why are regional banks failing?</strong></p>
      <p>Regional banks are failing because the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes to tamp down inflation have eroded the value of bank assets such as government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</p>
      <p>Most bonds pay a fixed interest rate that becomes attractive when interest rates fall, driving up demand and the price of the bond. On the other hand, if interest rates rise, investors will no longer prefer the lower fixed interest rate paid by a bond, thus driving down its price.</p>
      <p>Many banks increased their holdings of bonds during the pandemic, when deposits were plentiful but loan demand and yields were weak. For many banks, these unrealized losses will stay on paper. But others may face actual losses if they have to sell securities for liquidity or other reasons, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>
      <p>“The recent declines in bank asset values very significantly increased the fragility of the U.S. banking system to uninsured depositor runs,” economists wrote in a recent paper published on the Social Science Research Network</p>
      <p>Of course, this scenario would play out only if the government did nothing.</p>
      <p>“So, our calculations suggest these banks are certainly at a potential risk of a run, absent other government intervention or recapitalization,” the economists wrote.</p>
      <p><strong>How did Silicon Valley Bank collapse?</strong></p>
      <p>In the case of the Santa Clara-based Silicon Valley Bank, which held most of its assets in U.S. government bonds, the market value of its bonds fell when interest rates started going up.</p>
      <p>That’s because most bonds pay a fixed interest rate that becomes more attractive if interest rates fall, driving up demand and the price of the bond. But when interest rates rise, the lower fixed interest rate paid by a bond is no longer attractive to investors.</p>
      <p>The timing coincided with the financial difficulties many of the banks’ customers – largely tech startups – were dealing with, forcing them to withdraw their deposits.</p>
      <p>In addition, Silicon Valley Bank had a disproportional share of uninsured funding, with only 1% of banks having higher uninsured leverage, the paper notes. "Combined, losses and uninsured leverage provide incentives for an SVB uninsured depositor run."</p>
      <p>A run on these banks could pose a risk to even insured depositors − those with $250,000 or less in the bank − as the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund starts incurring losses, the economists wrote.</p>

    	<h3>From the editor’s desk</h3>
      <p>Dear Reader,</p>
    	<p>In the midst of every crisis lies great opportunity. That’s certainly true in the case of cryptocurrency, the most influential financial innovation of our age, whose very origins are often attributed to the global financial crisis that engulfed banks, economies and livelihoods some 15 years ago.</p>
    	<p>Case in point: the series of U.S. bank implosions that have set people on edge amid talk of a full-blown crisis in the industry whose echoes of 2008 are unmistakable.</p>	
    	<p>The opportunity lies in the way in which First Republic Bank has been snapped up by JPMorgan Chase following an auction that lasted into Sunday night. First Republic is not a crypto-focused bank, but neither is it crypto-averse. That fact won’t have been lost on its new owner, whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has been one of crypto’s most vocal critics. Despite Dimon’s dogmatic public pronouncements on cryptocurrencies, his staff has been quietly courting crypto companies that are seeking new friends in the banking industry following the implosions of Signature and Silvergate.</p>	
    	<p>Given JPMorgan’s increased engagement with the crypto industry, it appears unlikely that First Republic, as a new part of the banking giant’s empire, will depart from its own openness to crypto or that of its new owner.</p>
      <p>And although it’s true that the prices of the three biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap fell following the news of First Republic’s collapse, they’re currently trading above or around the levels at which they were changing hands three months ago.</p>
      <p>Crypto’s attractiveness as an alternative to equity investment (especially investment in smaller banks) has ticked up amid the recent bank implosions, which have also had the effect of opening up opportunities for big, established finance sector players to engage with the industry.</p>
      <p>All one needs to do is look beyond U.S. shores and see the momentum building in other jurisdictions. From Hong Kong ramping up its plans to regain a place at the top table in Web3 innovation, with a virtual asset service provider policy set to come into effect next month, to Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority providing clear direction, including a clampdown on the embattled Three Arrows Capital founders hoping to do business there. The contrast with what’s taking place in America, where crypto-related firms are still wondering whether they can continue receiving banking services, is dramatic.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to compare the industry’s mood from the Consensus conference in Austin, Texas last week, where I led some key conversations with founders of major protocols sharing a stage (look out for our new 30-minute show, Forkast IQ, which launches this week) with the vibe of where I’m headed next week.</p>
      <p>I’ll be in Dubai and Abu Dhabi to share ideas and host roundtable discussions with industry leaders and officials. I expect the gathering not to be dominated by challenges, but rather by encouragement and opportunity. I’ll report back.</p>
      <p>Until the next time,</p>
      <p>Angie Lau,</p>
      <p>Founder and Editor-in-Chief</p>
      <p>Forkast</p>
      <p><strong>1. Deal sealed</strong></p>
      <p>Investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase has announced its purchase of a “substantial majority of assets” of collapsed First Republic Bank after California regulators seized the failed lender and placed it under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The acquisition included US$173 billion of loans, approximately US$30 billion of securities and the assumption of US$92 billion of deposits, including US$30 billion of large bank deposits, which will be repaid following the closure of the deal or eliminated in consolidation.</li>
        <li>JPMorgan is assuming all insured and uninsured deposits as part of the agreement.</li>
        <li>“Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. “Our financial strength, capabilities and business model allowed us to develop a bid to execute the transaction in a way to minimize costs to the deposit insurance fund.”</li>
        <li>The takeover follows the second-largest banking failure in U.S. history and the fourth big banking failure this year after the implosions of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.</li>
        <li>Regulators took control of First Republic after it reported around US$100 billion of withdrawals last month, accounting for more than 40% of its total deposits. First Republic’s stock price plunged 45.4% last week following the announcement.</li>
        <li>As part of the deal, JPMorgan expects to recognize an upfront post-tax gain of approximately US$2.6 billion and anticipates US$2 billion of restructuring costs through 2023 and 2024. The deal is expected to generate more than US$500 million of incremental net income annually.</li>
        <li>Bitcoin fell as low as US$27,691 after JPMorgan’s announcement but had recovered to trade at US$29,227 by press time, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
        <li>Issues with the banking system could stoke increased demand for safe-haven assets such as Bitcoin and gold. Bitcoin’s price has risen almost 50% from its US$19,669 level on March 10, when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></p>
      <p>JPMorgan’s rescue of First Republic Bank has prompted mixed reactions across the finance sector. Although it was touted by the White House as depositors having dodged a bullet, others have been less sanguine about the deal.</p>
      <p>Markets, already spooked by uncertainty over further interest rate increases, have slid, with U.S. regional banks taking a big hit as some of their stocks suffered double-digit declines amid lingering questions about their long-term viability.</p>
      <p>Crypto prices reacted similarly negatively, with Bitcoin trading below US$27,700 before recovering to top US$29,000. Bitcoin liquidations also ticked up.</p>
      <p>Critics argue that JPMorgan’s acquisition was sweetened thanks to the U.S. government offering indemnity protection for buying the bank. They’re not wrong. Analysts believe the bank was bought with protections in place and that JPMorgan will profit immediately from the sale.</p>
      <p>The bigger question for the crypto industry is whether First Republic’s new owner will stick with its positive stance on crypto. The bank had offered guidance for investing in cryptocurrencies before its collapse.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan meanwhile, has made overtures to crypto firms looking for a secure base in the U.S. market, suggesting that whatever is left of First Republic will remain open to crypto. Historically the crypto industry has relied on smaller banks for its fiat on- and off-ramps. Having America’s biggest bank as the U.S. industry’s main off-ramp would offer a welcome form of respectability against a backdrop of stricter regulatory scrutiny.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Token tussle</strong></p>
      <p>Rivalry between non-fungible token (NFT) platforms is intensifying after NFT marketplace Tensor briefly overtook peer Magic Eden’s 24-hour sales volume on the Solana blockchain while Sotheby’s launched its own on-chain NFT marketplace.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tensor’s sales surge followed the launch of the Mad Ladz NFT collection on Solana, which generated more than US$16.8 million in secondary sales in its first week.</li>
        <li>To entice traders back to the NFT market, Magic Eden sent all trading fees received within the first 72 hours of Mad Ladz’s launch back to the community, the platform announced on Sunday.</li>
        <li>“What the market needs now is for a deep, renewed focus on Solana, and we intend to show the Solana community that we have still got their backs,” Tiffany Huang, head of marketing and content at Magic Eden, told The Block, adding that the company was excited to refocus on Solana.</li>
        <li>Competition between NFT platforms heated up further this week when auction house Sotheby’s announced the launch of its fully on-chain, peer-to-peer NFT marketplace for the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains.</li>
        <li>OpenSea rival Blur also announced the launch of Blend, a peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol for NFTs. Blend purports to offer new yield generation opportunities and higher liquidity for NFT holders. It launched with zero fees for lenders and borrowers.</li>
        <li>The Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.81% to 3,655.20 points in the 24 hours prior to press time and is down by 1.83% over the past week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></p>
      <p>The NFT marketplace war has mostly been a race to the bottom. Fees have been slashed to zero, royalties scrapped and market-distorting wash trading broadly tolerated, leaving many NFT creators with an even more meager slice of the pie. But the entry of prestige auction house Sotheby’s into the NFT marketplace promises a reversal of these trends.</p>
      <p>Sotheby’s, a hallowed institution in the fine art world better known for selling Picasso paintings and Jeff Koons sculptures, is luring NFT artists with promises of creator royalty fees between 5% and 10% of sale prices. Sotheby’s acknowledged that its decision comes amid a broader discussion on resale royalties in relation to NFTs and the market trend away from it.</p>
      <p>With NFT sales in a new downward spiral since their resurgence in January and February, Sotheby’s presence in this market provides assurances for deep-pocketed buyers. Since its entrance into the NFT space, it has sold US$120 million of NFTs, chalking up a series of records for some of the highest prices fetched for digital artworks.</p>
      <p>Those record-breaking fees came during the NFT boom years of 2021 and 2022, and it remains to be seen whether the 279-year-old auction house can continue to draw moneyed crowds to digital art. However things pan out, for the NFT artists picked by Sotheby’s, the chance to capture more royalties is at least a long-overdue realization of crypto’s early promise to creators.</p>
      <p><strong>3. License to build</strong></p>
      <p>Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitget is applying for a cryptocurrency exchange operating license in Hong Kong as part of the city’s new crypto licensing regime, which is set to take effect in June.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Bitget is applying for a crypto exchange operation license in Hong Kong,” its managing director, Gracy Chen, told Forkast in an interview. “We are in the process already. We have hired a compliance team.”</li>
        <li>Chen said she expected Hong Kong to provide more regulatory clarity around the issuance of crypto exchange licenses next month.</li>
        <li>Bitget — the 7th largest crypto exchange by trading volume, according to CoinGecko — is one of many crypto firms looking to establish a presence in Hong Kong after authorities announced a plan to remake the city into a global digital asset hub.</li>
        <li>As a lack of regulatory clarity clouds the outlook for crypto firms in the U.S., Ripple Labs President Monica Long told Forkast that crypto innovators could leave to seek greener pastures in Asian countries with more regulatory certainty.</li>
        <li>Chen said that Bitget was hiring staff for around 100 positions and that the exchange had doubled its workforce since last June.</li>
        <li>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s deputy chief executive, Arthur Yuen, last week urged banks to offer services to regulated virtual asset-related firms in a bid to attract more crypto companies to the city.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></p>
      <p>Just a year and a half ago, facing regulatory uncertainty in the aftermath of China’s ban on crypto, digital asset companies were fleeing Hong Kong. Bitget’s crypto exchange license application and plans to staff up operations in Hong Kong is a sign that city’s policy turnaround regarding Web3 is already paying off. As local authorities work to lay the foundations for the sector ― including urging banks to offer services to crypto firms ― Hong Kong seems poised to regain its primacy as a global digital assets hub.</p>
      <p>Only a month remains until Hong Kong’s new licensing regime for crypto trading platforms becomes operational, and many crypto firms have shown interest in obtaining such licenses. Experts have warned that there may be a backlog of license applications as demand grows.</p>
      <p>Angelina Kwan, chief executive officer of financial services firm Stratford Finance and a former member of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, recently told Forkast that the regulator would require that potential licensees use external firms that can help sign off on controls as part of the licensing process.</p>
      <p>In this new dawn for crypto in Hong Kong, whose new crypto-friendly policy stance reportedly enjoys Beijing’s support, even Chinese state-owned enterprises are making crypto-related investments in the city. For example, the Hong Kong unit of Chinese insurer China Pacific Insurance last month launched two cryptocurrency funds in partnership with investment firm Waterdrip Capital.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong is emblematic of the big difference that regulatory clarity can make in a nascent industry such as crypto. Within a predictable regulatory framework, crypto companies in the territory can now formulate business strategies and do long-term planning. In contrast, crypto companies in the U.S. find themselves increasingly at loggerheads with regulators, and industry pillars like Coinbase are having to go to court to obtain regulatory guidance. Hong Kong’s new legal framework for digital assets may serve as an example of not only what government oversight of the industry can accomplish but also a model of what regulations should be.</p>

    	<p>By Stephen Nellis, Josh Ye and Jane Lanhee Lee</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - U.S. microchip export controls imposed last year to freeze China's development of supercomputers used to develop nuclear weapons and artificial-intelligence systems like ChatGPT are having only minimal effects on China's tech sector.</p>	
    	<p>The rules restricted shipments of Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc chips that have become the global technology industry's standard for developing chatbots and other AI systems.</p>	
    	<p>But Nvidia has created variants of its chips for the Chinese market that are slowed down to meet U.S. rules. Industry experts told Reuters the newest one - the Nvidia H800, announced in March - will likely take 10% to 30% longer to carry out some AI tasks and could double some costs compared with Nvidia's fastest U.S. chips.</p>
      <p>Even the slowed Nvidia chips represent an improvement for Chinese firms. Tencent Holdings, one of China's largest tech companies, in April estimated that systems using Nvidia's H800 will cut the time it takes to train its largest AI system by more than half, from 11 days to four days.</p>
      <p>"The AI companies that we talk to seem to see the handicap as relatively small and manageable," said Charlie Chai, a Shanghai-based analyst with 86Research.</p>
      <p>The back-and-forth between government and industry exposes the U.S. challenge of slowing China's progress in high tech without hurting U.S. companies.</p>
      <p>Part of the U.S. strategy in setting the rules was to avoid such a shock that the Chinese would ditch U.S. chips altogether and redouble their own chip-development efforts.</p>
      <p>"They had to draw the line somewhere, and wherever they drew it, they were going to run into the challenge of how to not be immediately disruptive, but how to also over time degrade China's capability," said one chip industry executive who requested anonymity to talk about private discussions with regulators.</p>
      <p>The export restrictions have two parts. The first puts a ceiling on a chip's ability to calculate extremely precise numbers, a measure designed to limit supercomputers that can be used in military research. Chip industry sources said that was an effective action.</p>
      <p>But calculating extremely precise numbers is less relevant in AI work like large language models where the amount of data the chip can chew through is more important.</p>
      <p>Nvidia is selling the H800 to China's largest technology firms, including Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc for use in such work, though it has not yet started shipping the chips in high volumes.</p>
      <p>"The government isn’t seeking to harm competition or U.S. industry, and allows U.S. firms to supply products for commercial activities, such as providing cloud services for consumers," Nvidia said in a statement last week.</p>
      <p>China is an important customer for U.S. technology, it added.</p>
      <p>"The October export controls require that we create products with an expanding gap between the two markets," Nvidia said last week. We comply with the regulation while offering as-competitive-as-possible products in each market."</p>
      <p>Bill Dally, Nvidia's chief scientist, said in a separate statement this week that “this gap will grow quickly over time as training requirements continue to double every six to 12 months."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the U.S. Commerce Department that oversees the rules, did not return a request for comment.</p>
      <p>SLOWED BUT NOT STOPPED</p>
      <p>The second U.S. limit is on chip-to-chip transfer speeds, which does affect AI. The models behind technologies such as ChatGPT are too large to fit onto a single chip. Instead, they must be spread over many chips - often thousands at a time - which all need to communicate with one another.</p>
      <p>Nvidia has not disclosed the China-only H800 chip's performance details, but a specification sheet seen by Reuters shows a chip-to-chip speed of 400 gigabytes per second, less than half the peak speed of 900 gigabytes per second for Nvidia's flagship H100 chip available outside China.</p>
      <p>Some in the AI industry believe that is still plenty of speed. Naveen Rao, chief executive of a startup called MosaicML that specializes in helping AI models to run better on limited hardware, estimated a 10-30% system slowdown.</p>
      <p>"There are ways to get around all this algorithmically," he said. "I don't see this being a boundary for a very long time - like 10 years."</p>
      <p>Money helps. A chip in China that takes twice as long to finish an AI training task than a faster U.S. chip can still get the work done. "At that point, you've got to spend $20 million instead of $10 million to train it," said one industry source who requested anonymity because of agreements with partners. "Does that suck? Yes it does. But does that mean this is impossible for Alibaba or Baidu? No, that's not a problem."</p>
      <p>Moreover, AI researchers are trying to slim down the massive systems they have built to cut the cost of training products similar to ChatGPT and other processes. Those will require fewer chips, reducing chip-to-chip communications and lessening the impact of the U.S. speed limits.</p>
      <p>Two years ago the industry was thinking AI models would get bigger and bigger, said Cade Daniel, a software engineer at Anyscale, a San Francisco startup that provides software to help companies perform AI work.</p>
      <p>"If that were still true today, this export restriction would have a lot more impact," Daniel said. "This export restriction is noticeable, but it's not quite as devastating as it could have been."</p>

    	<p>ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS was considering the potential impact of buying struggling rival Credit Suisse as early as December, months before the takeover was hastily arranged by Swiss authorities in March, according to a regulatory filing.</p>	
    	<p>The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also showed UBS concluded in February that buying Credit Suisse was not desirable, but that it should prepare in case its rival encountered "serious financial difficulties".</p>	
    	<p>The disclosure, dated April 26, provides the clearest insight yet into UBS's thinking and shows it had been looking at its struggling competitor months before the rescue deal orchestrated by Swiss authorities was put together.</p>
      <p>In March, UBS agreed to take over Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) and said it would assume up to 5 billion francs in losses, as part of a rescue that is backed by as much as 250 billion francs of state support.</p>
      <p>In February, Switzerland's financial regulator FINMA said it was closely monitoring Credit Suisse given it was experiencing "significant" outflows, but noted the stabilising effect of its liquidity buffers. Only days before the rescue, the regulator and the central bank, while pledging funding if necessary, still judged Credit Suisse remained sound.</p>
      <p>They stepped in after clients, unsettled by market turmoil unleashed by the collapse of two mid-sized U.S. lenders, kept pulling money from the scandal-plagued 167-year-old institution.</p>
      <p>The regulator later defended its actions, saying it had been quick to respond and called for more powers to call banks to account.</p>
      <p>Since then, the Swiss authorities and UBS have been racing to close the takeover as soon as possible in an effort to retain Credit Suisse's clients and employees, Reuters has reported.</p>
      <p>Addressing a financial conference in Zurich on Wednesday, UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said the bank aimed to close the deal by the end of May or early June.</p>
      <p>UBS said in the filing that the merger still required approval from regulators in the European Union, India, Japan, Mexico and South Korea.</p>
      <p>Last month, UBS secured temporary approval from European Union antitrust regulators, while the U.S. Federal Reserve approved the UBS Group's acquisition of Credit Suisse's U.S. subsidiaries.</p>
      <p>The filing also said the merger could be terminated if its "closing conditions have not been satisfied" by December, but that any missing regulatory approvals would not be treated as a breach of those conditions by UBS.</p>

    	<p>LONDON/ SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday in fragile markets with traders on tenterhooks for any clues from the U.S. Federal Reserve statement today that rate hikes might peak and the soft landing that central banks have been angling for is in sight.</p>	
    	<p>Yields on 2-month U.S. Treasury bills jumped on rising concerns that the U.S. Treasury Department could hit its debt limit earlier than anticipated.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude, which dropped 5% overnight, fell further and was last down about 3% at $73.04 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Tuesday saw a hammering of shares of U.S. regional banks. PacWest Bancorp dropped 27.8%, while Western Alliance Bancorp tumbled 15.1% and Comerica Inc fell 12.4%.</p>
      <p>Markets are all but certain the Federal Reserve will announce a 25-basis-point rate hike when it announces its policy decision at 1800 GMT. If that happens, the focus will be on whether or how hard Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushes back on investors' expectations for rate cuts by year's end.</p>
      <p>The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up almost 0.5% after Tuesday's sharp selloff. S&P 500 futures edged up 0.1% but the mood was cautious, with banks in the crosshairs.</p>
      <p>"It's not clear today whether markets are driven by the debt ceiling, the rout in regional banks or anxiety about the FOMC determinations," said Vijay Modhvadia, managing director of Deuterium Capital Management.</p>
      <p>Traders will be combing the Fed's statement for any indication of a rate hike pause, or looking to see if the wording keeps options open for another hike in June, said Modhvadia.</p>
      <p>U.S. central bankers will have had an early look at the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which has not yet been released publicly, he added.</p>
      <p>In Europe, where the crisis of confidence in banks forced Credit Suisse into the arms of larger rival UBS six weeks ago, similar data was already public with lenders sharply turning off the credit taps, a report on Tuesday showed, perhaps making a case for a smaller European Central Bank rate hike this week.</p>
      <p>"The market consensus is for a soft landing and every hint in that direction, if you trust the Fed and the ECB, should be a source of good news for equities and credit," said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.</p>
      <p>Markets face a "macro heavy week" said Ielpo, with investors looking back at a strong first quarter earnings season but anticipating that Friday's U.S. jobs report might reveal a deteriorating macro economic situation.</p>
      <p>Markets in China and Japan were shut for a holiday. Hong Kong's shares fell, dragging MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares, ex-Japan, down about 0.6%.</p>
      <p>Bonds and gold held gains. The dollar, slipping, was caught in the crosswinds of falling yields and rising nerves.</p>
      <p>EYES ON THE FED</p>
      <p>Currency markets were steady and also awaiting direction from the Fed. The euro was last up 0.3% at $1.1030.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was flat after the previous day's 0.5% gain following a surprise rate increase from the Reserve Bank of Australia.</p>
      <p>Gold hovered above $2,016 an ounce, little changed on the day.</p>
      <p>Two-year U.S. treasury yields fell 2 bps to around 3.96% and 10-year yields fell 3 bps to around 3.40%.</p>
      <p>Investors have a wary eye on the looming U.S. debt ceiling, with lawmakers squabbling and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning the government might run out of money as soon as June 1.</p>
      <p>Top U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday called on President Joe Biden to accept their package or make a counter-offer, while a top Democrat said the Senate might try to advance a "clean" debt-ceiling hike next week.</p>
      <p>"Either this game is over within a few weeks or we are going to see a suspension of the debt limit until later this year," said Rabobank strategist Philip Marey. "In both cases, we are not likely to see any solution until financial markets start to panic."</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Another jam-packed week awaits investors as May gets underway with key announcements from the Federal Reserve, Apple (AAPL), and the April jobs report all on the docket.</p>
    	<p>Early Monday morning, investors learned that regulators seized First Republic (FRC) and sold the troubled bank's operations to JPMorgan Chase (JPM).</p>	
    	<p>On Wednesday afternoon, the Fed is set to announce its latest policy decision, which investors expect will see the central bank raise interest rates by another 0.25%, as it continues to fight stubborn inflation well above its 2% goal. On Thursday after the closing bell, Apple will release its latest quarterly earnings. And before the market open on Friday, the US government will release the April jobs report.</p>	
    	<p>Elsewhere on the schedule, key updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, as well as the latest data on job openings, highlight the economic side of things.</p>
      <p>On the earnings front, results from AMD (AMD), Starbucks (SBUX), Ford (F), Pfizer (PFE), and Uber (UBER) will highlight the schedule.</p>
      <p>Also, Yahoo Finance will be live this week at the Milken Institute's Global Conference, where insights and reaction from CEOs and top minds will proliferate throughout the week.</p>
      <p>Markets begin the new month after a resilient close to April's trading. GDP data out Thursday disappointed and results from Amazon (AMZN) late Thursday cast some doubt over the tech sector's rebound. Still, all three major averages pushed higher for the week with the tech-heavy Nasdaq rising 1.3%.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date, the Nasdaq is up nearly 17% while the S&P 500 is up closer to 8.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained just less than 3%.</p>
      <p>The next major test for markets awaits Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Fed will announce its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. ET, with Fed Chair Jay Powell set to hold a press conference a half hour later.</p>
      <p>According to data from the CME Group, markets are placing an 85% chance on the Fed raising rates by 0.25% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A 0.25% hike in interest rates would push the Fed’s benchmark rate to a range of 5%-5.25%. The benchmark rate hasn’t breached 5% since July 2007. With no new economic projections set for release, Powell's comments will be in focus for investors.</p>
      <p>"We believe the Committee will try to convey that while a June rate hike isn’t the incumbent scenario, the next move is more likely up than down," economists at JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients last week.</p>
      <p>"Odds are rising that the May hike will be the final hike of this tightening cycle," wrote Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients Friday. "When the Fed increases interest rates, it exposes any fissures in either the financial markets or the economy. For instance, the tightening in monetary policy has contributed to the recent stress in the banking system."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the economic data front, the April jobs report is expected to show 180,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month with the unemployment rate ticking slightly higher to 3.6%, according to data from Bloomberg. In March, the U.S. economy added 236,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell.</p>
      <p>The report will be closely watched for any signs of a softening labor market, which might influence the Fed's June decision on rate hikes.</p>
      <p>The Fed's aggressive rate hike path has tightened credit markets and raised concern over the health of the regional banking sector in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.</p>
      <p>First Republic shares sank nearly 75% last week as the lender revealed it lost $100 billion in deposits during the March banking turmoil.</p>
      <p>On the earnings side, Apple's quarterly results out Thursday will provide another look into how big tech is holding up amid fears of an economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>Investors will focus on whether Apple is seeing slowdown in spending similar to what was called out by Amazon last week. And, of course, with Apple set to release new VR headsets later this year, investors will inquire — what’s the AI strategy?</p>
      <p>Earnings season has broadly offered investors an upside surprise compared to Wall Street expectation.</p>
      <p>S&P 500 companies are beating analysts estimates at the highest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021, according to FactSet. With just more than half of S&P 500 companies already reporting results, 79% of companies have reported earnings above estimates. That’s above both the five- and ten-year averages.</p>
      <p>But as SoFi’s head of investment Liz Young pointed out to Yahoo Finance Live, those beats come against "unimpressive" expectations that have been revised downward this year.</p>
      <p>"Margins are contracting," Young said. "And a lot of the story coming into this [earnings season] was that margins were so fat, that they could absorb some of these cost pressures. But now we're seeing, over time, a lowering of those margins and narrowing of those margins. So there's not going to be as much breathing room for companies."</p>
      <p>Last week, big tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) catalyzed a market rally as results showed resilience despite a looming slowdown. That sentiment ultimately outweighed the gloomier outlook Amazon offered relative to its fellow tech titans.</p>
      <p>Still, analysts argue this better-than-feared picture poses a significant challenge to those remaining bearish on the sector that punished most harshly amid 2022's aggressive rate hikes.</p>
      <p>"Tech investors went into this week with some white knuckles and heartburn anticipating Big Tech stalwart earnings of Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Intel, and Amazon and now instead head into the weekend drinking a relaxing cappuccino with much better than feared tech earnings," wrote Wedbush's Dan Ives in a note published Saturday.</p>
      <p>"The narrative for the tech sector is becoming clearer and clearer despite many tech haters yelling fire in a crowded theater heading into [first quarter] earnings."</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Regulators seized First Republic (FRC) early on Monday and sold the bulk of the bank's operations to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
    	<p>JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, agreed to assume $173 billion in assets, $30 billion in securities and all of First Republic's $92 billion in deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sweetened the deal by agreeing to share losses on certain residential and commercial loans, giving JPMorgan some protection if the assets go bad.</p>	
    	<p>The fall of the $229 billion First Republic makes it the biggest casualty yet of the banking system turmoil that began in March, larger than either Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank. Seattle's Washington Mutual, which went under with $307 billion in assets in September 2008, is still the largest bank failure in US history.</p>	
    	<p>Even though JPMorgan agreed to protect all of First Republic's depositors, the seizure does add more of a burden to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which is used to absorb losses when banks go down.</p>
      <p>The FDIC estimates the First Republic failure will cost it $13 billion, on top of more than $22 billion from the two other failures in March. Taxpayer money does not support the fund; instead the FDIC recoups its costs with an assessment paid for by banks.</p>
      <p>As part of the First Republic agreement JPMorgan will make a cash payment of $10.6 billion to the FDIC, and the FDIC will also provide the bank with $50 billion in loans. JPMorgan said it will recognize a one-time, post-tax gain of roughly $2.6 billion. It anticipates $2 billion in post-tax restructuring costs over the next 18 months.</p>
      <p>The announcement followed a bidding war among various banks. The FDIC invited several big banks to make bids, including JPMorgan, Bank of America (BAC), and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), according to people familiar with the matter. Citizens Financial Group (CFG) and US Bancorp (USB) were also reportedly invited.</p>
      <p>Some of the same banks came to First Republic's aid in March with $30 billion in uninsured deposits, including $5 billion from JPMorgan. They were reluctant last week to provide a second rescue on their own, fearing First Republic would be seized anyway. JPMorgan will repay the $25 billion to the 10 other banks that provided them.</p>
      <h3>Dimon as rescuer</h3>
      <p>The deal to buy First Republic places CEO Jamie Dimon at the center of a national banking crisis for the second time in 15 years and further solidifies his status as a rescuer of weaker institutions.</p>
      <p>“Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” Dimon said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Dimon acted twice to help stabilize the financial system. JPMorgan purchased New York investment bank Bear Stearns in March of that year, getting a $29 billion backstop from the federal government, and then Seattle’s Washington Mutual in September of 2008.</p>
      <p>In the case of Washington Mutual, JPMorgan purchased its operations after regulators seized the Seattle thrift, just as JPMorgan did Monday with First Republic after it was seized by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.</p>
      <p>First Republic's 84 branches will open as JPMorgan offices this morning.</p>
      <p>The US government decided to make a critical exception in handing First Republic to JPMorgan. There is an existing rule preventing any bank from making an acquisition providing it with more than 10% of all US deposits, and JPMorgan is already above that cap. Regulators waived those deposit concentration restrictions and blessed the deal anyway.</p>
      <h3>Rise and fall</h3>
      <p>First Republic became the subject of a government bidding war after a fight for its survival that began in March when panic about the stability of regional lenders cascaded across the country. It tried to weather the turmoil by borrowing from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank while also taking in $30 billion in uninsured deposits from 11 of the country's largest banks.</p>
      <p>But First Republic's situation turned more serious Monday after it disclosed a loss of more than $100 billion in deposits. The drop was greater than expected and raised new concerns about the company's chances for survival.</p>
      <p>Investors punished the stock, sending it down nearly 50% in one day and then nearly 30% on Wednesday. On Thursday it rose nearly 9%, before plunging again Friday by 43%.</p>
      <p>First Republic was founded in 1985 by Jim Herbert, and over the decades expanded rapidly as it attracted wealthy customers clustered on either coast by offering them large single-family mortgages at ultra-low rates along with personalized service.</p>
      <p>It went from $88 billion in assets at the end of 2017 to more than $200 billion at the end of 2022. It was the nation's 14th-largest lender as of Dec. 31.</p>
      <p>Then it, like many banks of its size, struggled to adapt to an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a way of slowing inflation.</p>
      <p>The hikes lowered the value of the interest-rate sensitive assets on its balance sheet and helped create billions in unrealized losses, a hole that ultimately attracted the attention of investors and depositors following the fall of Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
      <p>The bank also had lots of uninsured depositors, making them a greater flight risk during the chaos that unfolded in March.</p>
      <p>When customers began pulling more than $100 billion, First Republic had to replace its deposit funding with more expensive borrowing from the Fed and the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Those borrowings, which peaked on March 15 at $138 billion, created another problem by placing more pressure on its profitability.</p>
      <p>First Republic developed a turnaround plan. It said Monday while releasing its first-quarter results that it planned to increase its amount of insured deposits, trim its borrowings, decrease its loan balances and reduce its workforce by 20-25%. Borrowings had dropped to $104 billion as of April 21 and the deposit outflows had slowed.</p>
      <p>But its disclosure about the amount of deposits lost in March, and the fact that the company decided not to take any questions from analysts, spooked investors.</p>
      <p>Short sellers also applied more pressure. Those with bets against First Republic have earned $1.37 billion year to date on a mark-to-market basis, according to S3 Partners. It is the most profitable short position among stocks thus far in 2023, according to S3.</p>
      <p>By Friday, First Republic's stock had dropped to $3.50, down 97% for the year. The bank's market value, once $40 billion, was just $640 million.</p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>(Bloomberg) -- US equity futures gained as strong earnings from tech majors Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. after the Wall Street close offered investors some reassurance amid continued concerns over the health of the economy.</p>
            <p>Contracts on the S&P 500 climbed about 0.4% after the index fell the most in a month Tuesday, driven in part by First Republic Bank’s 49% plunge. Nasdaq 100 futures were up more than 1%. Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft both rose in premarket trading after providing an auspicious start to the Big Tech earnings season, with Meta Platforms Inc. due to report after the bell today.</p>	
            <p>In Europe, the regional stock benchmark declined amid disappointing earnings. Software producer Dassault Systemes sank more than 8% after missing revenue estimates. Dutch chip-tool maker ASM International slumped more than 10% after offering a tepid outlook for the rest of the year. Roche Holding AG retreated even as its first-quarter sales exceeded expectations. Beats from Standard Chartered Plc and Sweden’s SEB AB failed to bolster sentiment.</p>	
            <p>“The markets are very much focused on some of the earnings story, but possibly overlooking the weight of economic deceleration that is playing through right now, particularly in the United States,” John Woods, Asia Pacific chief investment officer at Credit Suisse Group AG, said on Bloomberg Television. “I’m looking at a whole range of technical signals, which seem to be suggesting a risk-off environment.”</p>
          <p>Treasuries were little changed after the benchmark 10-year yield fell nine basis points Tuesday and the policy-sensitive two-year yield dropped 13 basis points. A gauge of the dollar declined. Bonds in Europe gained, with Sweden’s 10-year yield falling about 7 basis points after a much-anticipated Riksbank rate increase.</p>
          <p>Regional Banks Rally</p>
          <p>Worries over US regional banks, sparked by $100 billion of outflows reported by First Republic, eased somewhat after PacWest Bancorp said its deposits rebounded in April, sending shares of the California-based lender up more than 20%. Other mid-sized banks including Western Alliance Bancorp also rallied.</p>
          <p>First Republic rebounded about 5% after Bloomberg reported the lender is exploring an sale of up to $100 billion of long-dated mortgages and securities as part of a rescue plan. The fresh bout of banking turmoil has raised questions about the effect of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening on the economy broadly and lenders in particular.</p>
          <p>“The question is to what extent central banks and regulators can contain market sentiment and make clear to investors they need to keep a cool head, to give depositors confidence that there is no need to run to other banks,” said Tatjana Puhan, deputy chief investment officer at Tobam SAS. “So far the Fed has been very clear that they will continue to hike rates as long as needed to contain inflation.”</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in markets, oil edged higher, clawing back some of a drop on Tuesday. Gold was little changed. Iron ore rose after a brief dip below $100 a ton for the first time since December. Bitcoin climbed for a second day.</p>

            <p>(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., whose quarterly earnings each got a boost from their established search and cloud-computing businesses, used their time with investors to emphasize what’s next: artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>In their respective earnings calls on Tuesday, the tech giants, which are becoming rivals in the competition for the future of search, offered up starkly different assessments of just how much disruption is in store for the market. Google executives encouraged investors to trust in the company’s long track record as the world’s leading search engine, and framed AI as just another shift in its constantly evolving business. Microsoft suggested that something much more dramatic is underway.</p>	
            <p>Investors seemed to like Microsoft’s thesis better, sending its shares up as much as 7.7% in premarket trading before New York exchanges opened, while Alphabet increased less than 2%.</p>	
            <p>Read More: Microsoft Soars as Robust Cloud Growth Drives Beat: Street Wrap</p>
          <p>Until recently, Google was viewed as all but invincible in the market for online search, which it dominates worldwide. That changed with the debut of OpenAI’s wildly popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Microsoft has begun weaving OpenAI’s technology into its Bing search engine, and the partnership has ratcheted up pressure on Google to reinvent its core search business to allow for more of the conversational exchanges that generative AI makes possible.</p>
          <p>Speaking to analysts, Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai stressed that Google is investing heavily in AI, yet he downplayed what the technology would mean for the search advertising business, which remains the company’s lifeblood. He expressed optimism that users will continue to value online advertising even if their searches yield a summary composed by a large language model, rather than the familiar list of links that Google has long delivered.</p>
          <p>“Throughout the years, we have gone through many, many shifts in search,” Pichai said. “And as we have evolved search, I think we’ve always had a strong, grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well.”</p>
          <p>Yet Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested his company is a formidable challenger. He said app installations have quadrupled since the launch of the AI-powered Bing in February. He added that Bing took share in the US market in the quarter, without offering specific metrics.</p>
          <p>Read more: Microsoft Profit, Sales Top Estimates on Strong Cloud Demand</p>
          <p>“We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category — search,” Nadella said on the company’s earnings call.</p>
          <p>Billions of dollars in revenue could be up for grabs with even relatively small changes in market share. But in the past quarter, at least, Google’s search business appeared to be weathering the heightened competitive threats and a broader downturn in the digital advertising market. The company’s revenue from search and related businesses rose to almost $40.4 billion in the period ended March 31, besting analysts’ estimates.</p>
          <p>As Google moves to incorporate generative AI into search, Pichai said the company would draw on its institutional knowledge. “We’ll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality,” Pichai said. “And we’ll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information.”</p>
          <p>Yet the company has ample reason to be worried, said Max Willens, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.</p>
          <p>“Google’s core business is facing the most serious challenges it has encountered in quite some time,” Willens wrote in a note.</p>

          <p>Google’s partnerships with manufacturers of Android phones present another opportunity for Microsoft to gain ground. Yet there, too, Pichai suggested that Google’s long track record will win the day.</p>
          <p>“When we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win experience,” Pichai said. “And ultimately, partners end up choosing us because that’s what their users want.”</p>

            <p>Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on the top- and bottom-lines, while also authorizing a massive $70 billion stock buyback. Alphabet stock rose as much as 5% in after hours trading on the news.</p>
            <p>The Google and YouTube parent company reported revenues that beat expectations in its advertising segments, even amid an industry-wide digital ad slowdown. YouTube's ad revenue came in at $6.69 billion, a small, but important, beat after several tough quarters.</p>	
            <p>Alphabet's Google Cloud unit also turned a profit for the first time while revenue in this segment grew by 28%, the fastest of any of the company's main business segments.</p>	
            <p>Here are the key numbers from Alphabet's earnings, compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $69.7 billion actual versus $68.96 billion expected</li>
            <li><strong>EPS:</strong> $1.17 actual versus $1.08 expected</li>
            <li><strong>Google Ad Revenue:</strong> $54.55 billion actual versus $53.75 billion expected</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> $6.69 billion actual versus $6.64 billion expected</li>
          </ul>
          <p>"We are pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud," said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement.</p>
          <p>"We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation."</p>
          <p>The company also revealed a number of charges related to its efforts to rein in costs, including $2.6 billion in charges linked to the Alphabet's layoffs and office space cutbacks.</p>
          <p>Like much of the tech industry, Alphabet has been cutting costs aggressively this year and announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs in January.</p>
          <p>Google has also been at the center of the industry's AI competition that kicked off when ChatGPT's rise mad this technology the tech world's new growth catalyst. Over the last few months, Google's AI capabilities have been questioned by some as the company's AI chatbot, Bard, has failed to impress.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) and its mega-investment in Open AI — which developed ChatGPT — has gained substantial public attention.</p>
          <p>To reflect the company's shifting strategy, a number of changes are being made to its AI strategy, including the merging of two AI teams, Google Research's Brain unit and DeepMind.</p>
          <p>This change was reflected in Tuesday's results, which saw AI costs broken out of Alphabet's Other Bets segment for the first time.</p>
          <p>Losses related to the company's AI efforts totaled $3.3 billion during the first quarter while its Other Bets segment lost $1.23 billion. Operating income for Alphabet totaled $17.4 billion during the quarter.</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>(Bloomberg) -- European stocks declined as investors parsed a flood of earnings reports from some of the region’s biggest companies.</p>
            <p>The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped about 0.5%, with Swiss lender UBS Group AG dragging banks lower after results that fell short of analysts’ expectations. Spain’s Banco Santander SA slid as concern over outflows outweighed a first-quarter earnings beat. US equity futures declined after First Republic Bank’s results reignited concerns about prospects for its business after weeks of calm in the banking sector.</p>	
            <p>In other earnings news:</p>	
          <ul>
            <li>Swiss food producer Nestle SA advanced after posting healthy revenue growth</li>
            <li>Freight operator Kuehne + Nagel International AG jumped after a strong sea-logistics performance</li>
            <li>Drugmaker Novartis AG rose after first-quarter earnings exceeded analysts’ expectations</li>
            <li>Engineering firm ABB Ltd. climbed after raising revenue guidance for the year</li>
            <li>Swedish miner and smelter Boliden AB slumped, pulling the basic resources sub-index lower, after disruptions and rising costs at its mines unit weighed on earnings</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Contracts on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 traded about 0.5% lower. The S&P 500 closed just 0.1% higher on Monday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.2%. That extended to seven the number of trading days when the two indexes have both moved less than 1%. Heavyweights including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. will report results later Tuesday.</p>
          <p>A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar erased an earlier decline and Treasuries extended gains after 10-year yields slid eight basis points Monday, the biggest one-day decline since March. Government bonds across Europe rallied, with the German 10-year yield falling as much as eight basis points.</p>
          <p>Shares in China and Hong Kong tumbled, with the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index falling for a fifth day and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index headed for its lowest close in five weeks. Traders cite geopolitical tensions such as the US plans last week to limit investments in key parts of China’s economy, while Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders have highlighted risks the economy still faces.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, markets are now pricing in the peak for US interest rates in June, and then a decline to end the year below 4.5%.</p>
          <p>The small shifts in Fed projections underscore the lack of direction at the start of a busy week for economic data and corporate earnings. Data published Monday showed US manufacturing data was weaker than economists forecast, while uncertainty over the debt ceiling persisted. Later this week, US GDP data is forecast to reveal slower growth, and the so-called core PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, is expected to show price growth cooled.</p>
          <p>“The data justifies a 25 basis-point hike,” said Erick Muller, head of product and investment strategy at Muzinich & Co. in London. “But it’s going to be difficult for central banks to raise rates and then quickly within a few months to start reversing that.”</p>
          <p>The CBOE VIX index of equity volatility remained near the 17-month low reached last week, but JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Marko Kolanovic said that may spell trouble for stock investors as it gives a false sense of calm.</p>
          <p>Investors should remain stay defensive despite the current low volatility, according to Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy & research EMEA at State Street Global Advisors. “Over the medium to long term, inverted yield curves, slowing consumer spending and tightening in credit standards will all take their toll,” he said on Bloomberg Television.</p>
          <p>Some better-than-expected Chinese data in recent days haven’t been enough to bolster investor sentiment in the equity market.</p>
          <p>“People question the accuracy of the macro data, as bottom-up corporate earnings and guidance remain soft,” Bank of America Corp. strategists including Winnie Wu wrote in a research note. “We expect the debate on the bull/bear case to continue, and market may only get more clarity by June/July.”</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, oil steadied and gold rose. Bitcoin slid for a third day.</p>
          <p>Key events this week:</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>Banks on the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) are set to report their first quarter (Q1) results this week and next — starting with Standard Chartered (STAN.L) on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Investors will be keeping an eye on the inflows and outflows of deposits from each bank to help determine confidence.</p>	
            <p>It follows recent turmoil in the banking sector, which started in the US in March with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Concerned about the safety of their money, customers withdrew funds en masse.</p>	
            <p>Separately, Credit Suisse (CS) was recently rescued by its Swiss rival UBS (UBS), following its own set of challenges.</p>
          <p>Despite the recent deposit withdrawal crisis in the US, the impact is not expected to be the same in the UK. The Bank of England also said at the time that there was no reason to worry about a knock-on effect.</p>
          <p>“Due to the sheer size of high street banks like Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds, they are seen as a much safer place to deposit cash,” Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst, consulting for HYCM, said.</p>
          <p>“The recent uncertainty in the banking sector has probably encouraged people to move their money into more reliable institutions in the last few months, which would lead to surprisingly positive earnings data in the next week or so.”</p>
          <p>Barclays (BARC.L) is set to release Q1 results on Thursday, followed by NatWest (NWG.L) on Friday.</p>
          <p>Next week, the focus will then turn to results from HSBC (HSBA.L) on Tuesday, and Lloyds (LLOY.L) on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>Here’s what the analysts had to say in advance of the earnings due this week.</p>
          <p><strong>Standard Chartered (STAN.L)</strong></p>
          <p>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that the excitement around a potential takeover has ebbed away and said worries about the risks ahead for Standard Chartered have weighed on its share price.</p>
          <p>“Its pre-tax profit for Q1 is expected to be down slightly compared to the same period last year,” she said.</p>
          <p>“Although net interest income has been rising, helped by higher interest rates, it won’t have moved the dial as much as with some of its peers, given the bank is much more reliant on revenues from fee earning businesses like wealth management which have been facing headwinds in the higher interest rate environment.”</p>
          <p>The group has large exposure to some riskier commercial real estate debt in China, with related impairment charges chipping away at its full profit potential.</p>
          <p>“Investment in the sector disappointed at the last snapshot despite Chinese authorities’ stimulus efforts to this niggling worry is set to linger,” Streeter said.</p>
          <p><strong>Barclays (BARC.L)</strong></p>
          <p>Streeter said Barclays is less reliant on traditional interest income for its profits and won’t have enjoyed as much of the benefit of higher base rates compared to some of its peers.</p>
          <p>“Nonetheless, the ramping up of rates, with yet more hikes expected, will have benefited the bottom line,” she said.</p>
          <p>“Although its model based on fees, commission and trading should offer greater potential growth over the long term, there may be evidence in this update that management is bracing for more short-term volatility, particularly with the world’s largest economy expected to tip into recession.”</p>
          <p>Streeter also highlighted that as volatility has hit financial markets, fees for Barclays’ large investment division have been weaker than forecast, and said it has already been anticipating a higher number of loan defaults.</p>
          <p>“Although indices have crept back upwards in recent months, uncertainty has been the order of the day and the slowdown in dealmaking which its investment arm relies on, is likely to have continued,” she added.</p>
          <p><strong>NatWest (NWG.L)</strong></p>
          <p>Meanwhile, NatWest has generated most of its income from interest payments on loans it makes to consumers and companies.</p>
          <p>“It’s had a spring in its step as interest rate hikes have boosted its incomes,” according to Streeter.</p>
          <p>Moreover, with the Bank of England expected to announce another rate hike in May to tame inflation, Streeter said this more positive environment will hang around for longer.</p>
          <p>“However, weakness is being sniffed out further ahead, given the expectation that rates will start to come back down as inflation falls back in the second half of the year and NatWest doesn’t have as many diversified income streams to rely on as some of its peers,” she said.</p>
          <p>“The banking scare may have put another spanner in the works as some banks are expected to take defensive action and try and attract more deposits by offering higher rates to savers which could eat further into net income margins.”</p>
          <p>However, NatWest is well capitalised, running on a Common Equity Tier ratio of over 14%, which is a comfortable position to be in.</p>
          <p><strong>Other factors to watch</strong></p>
          <p>Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said another important factor to watch out for in earnings reports will be the default ratio that banks are experiencing due to the higher interest rates and what they anticipate in the coming months.</p>
          <p>“Remember, over a million mortgages are only due for renewal in London, and these people will be paying double the interest rate they paid before. This means higher default rates,” he said.</p>
          <p>Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at CompareBroker.io, said the higher interest rate environment is likely to lead to UK banks repeating the same narrative as their Wall Street peers.</p>
          <p>“Which is that the higher interest rate environment is lifting profitability prospects higher,” he said.</p>

            <p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Stocks fell broadly and the U.S. dollar also weakened early on Tuesday, reflecting investors' uncertainty in a busy week for corporate earnings and economic data.</p>	
            <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.2% by 0510 GMT.</p>	
            <p>Markets in Australia and New Zealand are shut for a holiday.</p>
          <p>U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis lost 0.3%.</p>
          <p>In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.3%. German DAX futures and FTSE futures fell 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.</p>
          <p>Japan bucked the overall stock weakness, as its benchmark Nikkei average gained 0.4%, touching 8-month high as strong chip investment lifted tech shares.</p>
          <p>On Monday, the Nasdaq closed lower, underperforming the S&P 500 and the Dow, with pressure from high-profile megacaps as investors awaited results from companies including Microsoft, while Tesla shares fell on concerns about its spending plans.</p>
          <p>"There's a lot of uncertainty. People still don't know how much bank lending has been impacted by recent developments ... (or) when inflation will durably peak," said Prashant Bhayani, chief investment officer Asia, BNP Paribas Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>Bhayani also pointed to anxiety about other weak spots that might be exposed by the recent turmoil in U.S. and Swiss banks.</p>
          <p>Troubled U.S. bank First Republic Bank shares sank more than 20% after the closing bell on Monday as it said deposits plunged by more than $100 billion in the first quarter and it was exploring options such as restructuring its balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Swiss banking giant UBS Group reported a 52% slide in quarterly profit, as it prepares to integrate fallen rival Credit Suisse. The drop in profit was largely due to UBS setting aside a further $665 million to cover the costs of toxic mortgages that played a central role in the global financial crisis some 15 years ago.</p>
          <p>Market participants are waiting for corporate earnings and a mix of economic data from the U.S., Europe and China for cues on the growth momentum and when a recession in the U.S. economy might start, he added.</p>
          <p>Over in China, Hong Kong's benchmark fell 1.9%, while mainland stocks lost 0.9%.</p>
          <p>Despite a recent string of strong macro data including China's 4.5% GDP growth for the first quarter and retail sales that beat expectations, the economic recovery there is still uneven and has yet to trickle down to corporate earnings, said Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP.</p>
          <p>"With the reopening stories clearly behind us, we don't yet have clear visibility as to where we are going to see priorities in policymaking," he said.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. treasury market, yields fell as participants looked for less risky places to park cash amid concerns over the approaching U.S. debt ceiling deadline, with the House of Representatives expected to vote on a Republican-led debt and spending bill this week.</p>
          <p>Benchmark 10-year notes edged down to 3.4749% by 0511 GMT, after strengthening on Monday to 3.5034%.</p>
          <p>One-month Treasury yields rose from their lowest levels since October on Monday on concerns about a potential standoff over the debt ceiling.</p>
          <p>, with the House of Representatives expected to vote on a Republican-led debt and spending bill this week.</p>
          <p>The dollar index was almost flat by 0510 GMT, paring some earlier losses. Gold gave up some gains. Spot gold was traded at $1991.39 per ounce.</p>
          <p>Oil prices were steady. Brent crude edged up 4 cents $82.70 a barrel by 0506 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude edged up to $78.73 a barrel.</p>

            <p>Dow Jones futures were little changed ahead of Tuesday's open, with a busy week of earnings results ahead that includes tech titans Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). Late Monday, First Republic Bank (FRC) crashed after the company's earnings results late.</p>
            <p>Also late Monday, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and First Republic Bank were on the move after earnings. Cadence shares lost nearly 4% in extended trade.</p>	
            <p>First Republic crashed more than 20% after total deposits cratered 35.5% from last year to $104.5 billion as of March 31, even with the $30 billion injected from the biggest banks. Deposits declined by $72 billion during the quarter, down 40.8% from year-end. FactSet analysts projected deposits dropping to $145 billion.</p>	
            <p>"With the closure of several banks in March, we experienced unprecedented deposit outflows," commented CFO Neal Holland in a statement.</p>
          <p>Early Tuesday, 3M (MMM), Dow (DOW), General Electric (GE), General Motors (GM), Halliburton (HAL), McDonald's (MCD), PepsiCo (PEP), PulteGroup (PHM), Spotify (SPOT), UPS (UPS) and Verizon Communications (VZ) will be key earnings reporters.</p>
          <p>Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft will report late Tuesday. Meta earnings are scheduled for Wednesday after the market close. And Amazon earnings are due late Thursday.</p>
          <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
          <p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, with Chevron (CVX) one of the big winners. CVX stock rallied 1.4%. The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 0.3%.</p>
          <p>EV leader Tesla traded down 1.5% Monday. Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple (AAPL) rose 0.2% and Microsoft (MSFT) lost 1.4% in today's stock market action.</p>
          <p>Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), IBD Leaderboard stock Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and IBD SwingTrader stock Lululemon Athletica (LULU) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Nike (NKE) and Visa (V) — are among the top stocks to buy and watch with the ongoing market rally.</p>
          <p>Nike and DraftKings were featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
          <p>Ahead of Tuesday's opening bell, Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed vs. fair value in overnight trading. Remember that overnight action in Dow Jones futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 3.51% Monday. Over the last two weeks, the 10-year yield rebounded from its lowest level since mid-September. U.S. oil prices rose Monday, as West Texas Intermediate futures settled just below $79 a barrel.</p>
          <h3>What To Do In The Stock Market Rally</h3>
          <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column with the stock market trend in a "confirmed uptrend" after continued gains.</p>
          <p>Amid Monday's quiet action, the market outlook remains in a confirmed uptrend, which means investors continue to have the green light to buy breakout stocks. IBD's recommended exposure currently sits at 40% to 60%.</p>
          <p>Two useful IBD MarketSmith lists to check right now are "Breaking Out Today" and "Near Pivot." The latter shows stocks nearing buy points in bases, and the other flags stocks rising past buy points during the session.</p>
          <p>To find more stock ideas, check IBD Stock Lists, like IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Stocks Near A Buy Zone. These features identify bullish patterns and buy points and should be checked every day.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: JPMorgan, Nike, Visa</h3>
          <p>JPMorgan shares inched higher Monday, holding steady near a flat base's 144.44 buy point and above the 50-day moving average, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition.</p>
          <p>Nike shares rose 1.2% Monday, still above their 50-day line and approaching a cup-with-handle's 127.59 buy point.</p>
          <p>Visa shares remain in buy range above a 230.15 cup-with-handle buy point. The buy range goes up to 241.66. Visa reports fiscal second-quarter results late Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $270.42 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.28% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.09% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 4.87%.</p>
            <p>Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 1.27% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.98% and lagged the S&P 500's gain of 3.31% in that time.</p>	
            <p>Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nvidia as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.92 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 32.35%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.5 billion, down 21.59% from the year-ago period.</p>	
            <p>NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.50 per share and revenue of $29.68 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +34.73% and +10.03%, respectively.</p>
          <p>It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.</p>
          <p>Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.</p>
          <p>Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.83% higher. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).</p>
          <p>In terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 60.23. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.84, which means Nvidia is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 3.44. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.98 as of yesterday's close.</p>
          <p>The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 167, which puts it in the bottom 34% of all 250+ industries.</p>
          <p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>

            <p>By Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas</p>
            <p>April 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes struggled for direction on Monday as investors awaited results from megacap companies and key data that could shed light on the U.S. economy and shape the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.</p>	
            <p>Major technology and growth companies Alphabet Inc , Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Meta Platforms Inc, which constitute more than 14% of the value of the benchmark S&P 500, are scheduled to report results this week.</p>	
            <p>A rally in these stocks has supported Wall Street this year, and investors are waiting to see if the gains can continue amid a gloomy economic outlook.</p>
          <p>"Not only must these companies beat, but they must also guide to a re-acceleration of EPS growth in the second quarter and beyond ... that's what the Street is looking for," said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.</p>
          <p>U.S. stocks have largely held steady through the start of the earnings season on stronger-than-expected results from big banks, allaying concerns about a contagion from the banking crisis in March.</p>
          <p>Coca-Cola Co gained 1% after the beverage giant beat estimates for quarterly results on resilient demand for its sodas despite multiple price increases.</p>
          <p>Of the 90 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results so far, nearly 77% have topped analysts' profit estimates, as per Refinitiv IBES data. The long-term average beat rate stands at 66%.</p>
          <p>Forecasts for earnings have also improved marginally, with analysts expecting a quarterly profit contraction of 4.7% versus a 5.1% decline estimated at the start of April.</p>
          <p>Early readings of first-quarter U.S. GDP, personal consumer expenditure index (PCE) for March, consumer confidence numbers for April are among the data scheduled for release this week.</p>
          <p>Mixed economic numbers last week cemented bets of another 25-basis-point rate hike by the Fed in May, with money market traders pricing in a 92% chance of such a move, as per CME Group's Fedwatch tool.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the House would vote on his spending and debt bill this week amid lingering concerns that the U.S. government could hit its debt ceiling sooner than expected.</p>
          <p>"Based mostly on history, we seem to resolve this before we have a real crisis," said Hugh Johnson, chief economist of Hugh Johnson Economics. "But it's not clear that the House Speaker has a good plan out there and that it's going to be acceptable."</p>
          <p>At 9:37 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.80 points, or 0.02%, at 33,816.76, the S&P 500 was up 3.84 points, or 0.09%, at 4,137.36, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.43 points, or 0.10%, at 12,084.89.</p>
          <p>Bed Bath & Beyond Inc's shares tumbled 26% as the home goods retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after it failed to secure funds to stay afloat.</p>
          <p>First Republic Bank gained 4.7% ahead of its quarterly report.</p>
          <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
          <p>The S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 31 new highs and 51 new lows.</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>Tesla (TSLA) stock is slipping after the bell as the electric-vehicle maker reported slight revenue and profit misses and gross margin that dipped below 20% to 19.3% as the cost of recent price cuts hit profitability.</p>  
            <p>For the quarter, Tesla reported Q1 revenue of $23.33 billion, slightly below Street estimates of $23.35 billion, with Q1 adjusted EPS coming in at $0.85, below Street estimates of $0.86. That revenue figure for Q1 represents a slight dip from the $24.32 billion Tesla reported in Q4, but still 24% higher than a year ago.</p>	
            <p>On the profitability end, Tesla reported adjusted net income of $2.9 billion, less than the $3.03 billion estimated by the Street, and a billion less than last quarter and $700 million less than a year ago. With revenue staying flat-ish and profit dipping, the effects of margin compression could be at play here.</p>	
            <p>"Although we implemented price reductions on many vehicle models across regions in the first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable rate. We expect ongoing cost reduction of our vehicles, including improved production efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and remain focused on operating leverage as we scale." the company said in a statement.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Tesla still sees 2023 global production of 1.8 million vehicles, with its long-term delivery growth rate staying at 50%. Tesla also said Cybertruck production is on track to begin later this year at Giga Austin, with the company producing "Alpha," or early test versions, of the vehicle.</p>
          <p>Tesla instituted a number of price cuts in the U.S., Asia, and some European markets in Q1 of this year. Gross margins dipping to 19.3% may reflect the costs of those price cuts.</p>
          <p>Last night, Tesla slashed prices of its Model 3 and Model Y EVs yet again, in fact bringing one of them below $40,000.</p>
          <p>Yesterday's price cut, the sixth one this year by Tesla in the U.S., saw each version of the Model Y SUV slashed by $3,000 each, with the Model 3 RWD (rear-wheel drive) dropping by $2,000 to $39,990. The base Model Y, known as the AWD or all-wheel drive version, now starts at $46,990.</p>
          <p>Tesla has now cut prices of its base Model 3 by 11% this year alone, and its base Model Y prices have fallen by 20%, according to calculations done by Reuters. These latest price cuts come as the federal government limited the number of vehicles eligible for the electric vehicle tax credit, with Tesla's base Model 3 RWD seeing its tax credit fall by half to $3,500.</p>
          <p>Wall Street banks such as Evercore ISI have attempted to quantify the price cuts. “If we assume ~$2k US [price] cut ave translates to ~$1k global and then half of that is offset by cost improvements… then $500 cut to gross profit equates to ~100bps of gross margin pressure and implies 19% Q2/Q3 Auto gross margins (rough math,” the analysts said earlier this month.</p>
          <p>Similarly, Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan has been wary of the price cut effect on Tesla’s profitability, as well as other EV-makers.</p>
          <p>“We have been cautious about the profit impact of Tesla’s price cuts, writing that the lower prices are negative overall for Tesla, less negative for traditional automakers such as GM and Ford (given they are now likely to lose even more money in the interim on EVs, although they have other profit centers to offset such losses), and most negative of all for pure-play battery electric automakers competing with Tesla (such as Rivian), as they, too, are likely to lose more money on EVs although do not have profits elsewhere to offset these losses,” Brinkman wrote earlier in April.</p>
          <p>And similar to last quarter, analysts are keying in on the word “demand” as it pertains to production and backlog. In Q1 Tesla delivered around 423K vehicles and produced 440K globally; analysts at Evercore, for instance, would like to hear any indication of how Q2 deliveries are tracking and if the order backlog is growing. Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow wrote in a note to clients that week that Tesla's most recent U.S. price cuts indicated "slowing demand" for the EV maker.</p>
          <p>Looking further ahead to the post-earnings conference call, investors and analysts will be waiting to hear any progress on Cybertruck production which is slated to begin later this year, any new information on the gen 3 platform discussed at Tesla’s investor day, and more on the timeline ahead for construction of Tesla’s latest gigafactory in Mexico.</p>

            <p>Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.</p>
            <p>The stock market rally advanced modestly this past week, with some sizable gains and reversals. Recession fears are rising, even as inflation cools.</p>	
            <p>There weren't too many buying opportunities. Some stocks flashed buy signals, then quickly fell back. Investors should be cautious about adding exposure in the current environment. Amid market volatility, Apple (AAPL), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) have forged bullish tight patterns.</p>	
            <p>Earnings season is heating up. Tesla (TSLA), ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX) and DHI stock are all near buy points with earnings on tap. ASML and D.R. Horton (DHI) provided insight into their respective groups.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Western Alliance Bank (WAL) is among the many banks and financials reporting this coming week. How is this Phoenix-based bank holding up? WAL stock has been among the most embattled in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>LULU stock is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist and the IBD 50.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.</p>
          <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
          <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
          <p>The stock market rally had modest gains for the week, despite volatile action day to day.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 1.2% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index gained 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 1.5% in an inside week.</p>
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 14 basis points to 3.52%.</p>
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures rose 2.3% to $82.52 a barrel last week.</p>
          <h3>ETFs</h3>
          <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gained 2.65% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) advanced 1.9%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gained 0.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dipped 0.1% after tumbling 4.1% in the prior week. ASML stock is a big SMH holding.</p>
          <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) rose 0.6% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) gained 2%. Tesla stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
          <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) advanced 2% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) climbed 2.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) sank 1.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) jumped 4.1%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) rallied 2.65%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) added 0.8%.</p>
          <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rebounded 2.8%. But the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slipped 0.75%. WAL stock is among the many KRE holdings.</p>
          <h3>Apple Stock, Lululemon</h3>
          <p>Apple stock, Lululemon and Regeneron have all forged tight patterns, but in different circumstances.</p>
          <p>Apple stock rose 0.3% to 165.21 last week, rebounding from the 21-day line on Thursday. Shares edged down 0.15% in the prior week. With two straight weekly closes of 1%-1.5% within the prior week, that qualifies as a three-weeks-tight. The AAPL stock buy point is 166.94. That would be slightly extended from a flat base cleared a month ago, but could provide a place for existing holders to add a few shares.</p>
          <p>LULU stock climbed 1.1% to 368.25, also creating a three-weeks-tight with a 371.36 buy point. The yoga apparel retailer has held fast after an earnings gap-up. Lululemon's 3-week tight is within a cup base. Indeed, on a daily chart, the tight pattern acts a handle. So investors could use a breakout as a place to start a position. Ideally, LULU stock would offer more of a shakeout first.</p>
          <p>REGN stock nudged up 0.1% to 829.33, now boasting a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 837.65 entry. The biotech giant is still in buy range of a flat base breakout from 800.58. Investors could use a move past the tight entry as a place to start or add to a Regeneron stock position.</p>
          <h3>Tesla Earnings</h3>
          <p>Tesla earnings for the first quarter are due Wednesday evening. The electric vehicle giant reported record Q1 deliveries earlier this month, thanks to big price cuts and new U.S. EV credits. Even so deliveries fell short of views, with production once again exceeding sales substantially.</p>
          <p>Now investors will see how much that affected Tesla's prized profit margins, which had already been starting to slide last year.</p>
          <p>On Friday, Tesla cut prices in Europe, Singapore and Israel, though the European cuts largely absorbed early March discounts. A week earlier, Tesla cut U.S. prices on all its vehicles. That points to further margin pressure in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Tesla stock dipped 6 cents to 185 in the past week after tumbling 10.8% in the prior week. Shares hit resistance at the 21-day and 50-day lines. TSLA stock has a cup-with-handle base that formed below the 200-day moving average, which is not great. So while Tesla has a 207.89 buy point, investors might wait for a decisive move above the 200-day, which is now below 213.</p>
          <p>Another possibility is if Tesla stock breaks above the 50-day line on earnings, offering an early entry with a little room to the 200-day.</p>
          <h3>Netflix Earnings</h3>
          <p>Netflix earnings are due Tuesday night. After a tough 2022, profits are expected to bounce back. Subscription gains often are more important than earnings for Netflix. The results will also be important for streaming rivals such as Disney (DIS), as well as Roku (ROKU).</p>
          <p>After more than doubling from July to early February, Netflix stock forged a new cup-with-handle base with a 349.90 buy point. The handle has formed in scant volume and with support at the 50-day line. NFLX stock edged down 0.2% for the week to 338.63.</p>
          <h3>ASML Earnings</h3>
          <p>ASML stock will report early Wednesday morning, with peer Lam Research (LRCX) due after the close. ASML earnings also are bouncing back in 2023 after a difficult 2022. After nearly doubling from October to early February, ASML stock has forged a cup-with-handle base, according to MarketSmith analysis. Shares rose 1.4% to 666.20 this past week, rebounding from the 50-day line. The buy point is 683.28.</p>
          <h3>D.R. Horton Earnings</h3>
          <p>D.R. Horton earnings are due early Thursday, kicking off results for homebuilders, several of which are in or near buy zones. The homebuilding giant is expected to report a big EPS decline, like other rivals. Guidance will be key. DHI stock rose 2.7% to 98.25. On Tuesday, shares reclaimed a 99.50 cup-with-handle buy point, but then fell back.</p>
          <h3>Western Alliance Bancorp Earnings</h3>
          <p>Western Alliance reports Tuesday night. The California-based bank already provided some key Q1 metrics, including deposits and unrealized losses. But investors will want to hear about ongoing conditions. WAL stock rose 2.9% to 31.66 last week, but is still down sharply in 2023. As Warren Buffett said on Wednesday, bank deposits are probably safe, but it's not clear that bank stocks will be.</p>
          <p>Charles Schwab (SCHW), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and several superregional banks report this coming week.</p>
          <p>Altogether, they'll provide a good picture about deposit and lending trends.</p>
          <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
          <p>The stock market rally didn't have big weekly moves, but there were big daily and intraday swings. The major indexes staged big rallies on Thursday, bracketed by downside reversals on Wednesday and Friday.</p>
          <p>Indeed, the Nasdaq composite fell every day but Thursday, and still eked out a weekly gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit two-month highs Friday before retreating, with the Dow up for a fourth straight week.</p>
          <p>The major indexes aren't far from 2023 highs, but they aren't that far from undercutting their 50-day lines either.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which doesn't give more weight to megacaps such as Apple or Tesla stock, rallied from the 200-day line, but hit resistance several times at the 50-day.</p>
          <p>Over the past week, markets became more concerned about recession risks, especially on Wednesday news that Fed staff predicted a "mild recession" back at the March policy meeting. But despite those concerns, and generally improving inflation data, the odds of a May rate hike actually increased to 80% on Friday.</p>
          <p>Recession and Fed rate hikes are not a great combination for stocks. So the market rally showed resilience this past week. And, despite the volatility, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have forged de facto 3-weeks tight patterns, with their recent ranges, much like LULU stock.</p>
          <p>Market breadth has improved somewhat in the past couple of weeks. But there weren't a lot of stocks flashing buy signals. And the market's downside reversals meant that some stocks that looked actionable quickly faded or reversed.</p>
          <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
          <p>How exposed should investors be? It depends on what stocks you own. Some stocks flashing buy signals in the past few weeks have fared well, while others have been mixed or reversed lower.</p>
          <p>The volatile market swings have made it tricky to add stocks recently. So perhaps it's a good thing that buying opportunities were relatively scarce on Thursday's big rally.</p>
          <p>The macroeconomic picture remains in flux, while earnings season will be ramping up over the next few weeks. So more volatility is likely in the cards.</p>
          <p>If the market does show some strength, and stocks flash buy signals, add exposure gradually. Be ready to take partial profits and exit losers. Remember: If you're quick to add exposure, you have to be ready to scale out just as fast.</p>
          <p>Finding early entries and buying close to those buy points is still a smart strategy. So spend the weekend running screens and building up your watchlists.</p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>First quarter earnings season will ramp up rapidly in the week ahead.</p>
            <p>After big bank earnings unofficially got the proceedings underway on Friday, results from high-profile stock market winners this year like Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) will highlight a busy schedule for investors tracking corporate results.</p>	
            <p>The economic calendar will offer some reprieve for those more closely keeping tabs on macroeconomic developments and the impact this data could have on the Federal Reserve next month.</p>	
            <p>All three major indexes logged gains last week with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1.1% to pace the week's gains. On Friday, JPMorgan (JPM) led a rally in bank stocks, rising more than 7% for its best day since 2020.</p>
          <p>"This week, the initial earnings from a few very large banks suggest that the quick work of the FDIC and Federal Reserve in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure [has] prevented broader damage," strategists at Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note to clients on Friday.</p>
          <p>"Lenders including PNC Financial, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi reported Friday, and the sigh of relief from markets was palpable."</p>
          <p>JPMorgan's results revealed the bank "has been a port in the storm," wrote Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo in a note on Friday. Mayo said the set of results released Friday left him asking — What banking crisis?</p>
          <p>JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon even went so far as to tell an analyst during Friday's conference call, "I wouldn't use the word credit crunch, if I were you."</p>
          <p>Still, Dimon cautioned the US economy will face challenges in the months ahead, writing in the company's earnings release, "the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon, and the banking industry turmoil adds to these risks."</p>
          <p>Higher rates, the war in Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions are among the factors Dimon cited as posing risks to the economy.</p>
          <p>The financial sector will remain in focus in the early part of the week ahead, with results from Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Monday providing a key look at how some firms at the center of last month's bank crisis fared during the quarter. During the peak of March's bank crisis, Charles Schwab felt compelled to come out publicly and reassure investors its liquidity remained strong.</p>
          <p>Shares of the brokerage firm have lost nearly 40% so far this year, including a more than 30% drop in March alone. Investors have feared pressure on Schwab's deposit base as clients move money from "sweep accounts" into higher-yielding alternatives that could impact the company's immediate access to capital.</p>
          <p>Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) results out Tuesday morning will offer another read on how larger lenders and investment banks fared during turmoil that centered on smaller, regional lenders.</p>
          <p>Investors will face a lighter schedule on the economic data side, as the monthly run of housing data picks up with homebuilder sentiment, home prices, and housing starts data all set to cross the wires.</p>
          <p>Wednesday's Beige Book report from the Fed will also set the table for the Fed's discussion of the economic environment at its next policy meeting, which is set to begin in just over two weeks on May 2. Data from the CME Group showed that as of the end of last week investors were placing a nearly 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.25% in its next policy announcement.</p>
          <p>Last week's key economic report came Wednesday morning when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March showed headline inflation cooled to an annual rate of 5% in March while "core" inflation — which excludes the more volatile costs of food and energy — rose 5.6% over the last year.</p>
          <p>Retail sales and industrial production data out Friday, in addition to Thursday's initial claims reading, however, suggested the economy is softening on the margins and will likely weaken further in the coming months.</p>
          <p>"Incoming data signal the economy ended the first quarter on a weak note, with consumers less willing to spend, labor market conditions softening, and industrial sector output on a negative track," wrote Oren Klachkin, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Friday.</p>
          <p>"We believe Q1 will end up being the best quarter this year for the economy as tighter credit conditions and elevated interest rates slow GDP growth to a crawl in Q2 and spark a recession in the second half of the year. The weaker economy will ease price pressures, but not enough for the Fed to achieve its 2% inflation target anytime soon."</p>
          <p>This combination of a slowing economy and stubborn inflation is likely to make investor debate about the Fed's next move even more robust in the coming months as the central bank balances risks that each call for the opposite policy response.</p>
          <p>As Barclays economist Marc Giannoni wrote in a note to clients on Friday: "Fed communication earlier this week suggests that the debate about the course of policy is about to heat up."</p>

            <h3>China Searches for Clearer Signs of Economic Momentum</h3>
            <p>(Bloomberg) -- China’s key economic data in the coming week is likely to show a pickup in growth after Beijing dropped its Covid Zero rules, though it’s not yet clear how solid or sustainable the recovery will be.</p>
            <p>Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show gross domestic product grew 3.9% in the first quarter compared to a year prior, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. While that would be an improvement on the 2.9% expansion recorded in the October to December, it’s still below the official target for full-year growth of around 5%.</p>	
            <p>March data is also expected to show increases in industrial output, investment and retail sales — though that’s partly due to the low base of comparison with March last year, when Shanghai, China’s largest city, was in lockdown.</p>	
            <p>Early indicators, meanwhile, have been mixed: while credit and export growth beat expectations last month, weak inflation suggested demand remains subdued.</p>
          <p>Uncertainty over the strength of the data leaves open the debate of whether more stimulus is needed.</p>
          <p>Chinaese officials have taken a pro-growth stance on the economy this year, though they’ve so far avoided aggressive easing measures such as cutting policy interest rates. Instead, the People’s Bank of China in March injected more cash into the financial system to encourage lending. Government bond sales have also been strong as infrastructure investment is ramped up through front-loaded fiscal support.</p>
          <p>Speculation is brewing, though, over whether China would consider a rate cut or other measures, such as fiscal support. The central bank is expected to keep the rate on its one-year policy loans unchanged on Monday, but recent muted inflation figures suggest the PBOC will need to cut that rate in the second quarter by 10 basis points, David Qu of Bloomberg Economics wrote this week.</p>
          <p>What Bloomberg Economics Says:</p>
          <p>“China’s first-quarter GDP will likely deliver clear evidence of recovery from the Covid-driven slump, powered by consumer spending and government stimulus.”</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is set to speak and US data will show how much the Federal Reserve’s rapid tightening is weighing on housing. Meanwhile, South Korean export figures will provide a reading on global trade momentum.</p>
          <p>US Economy and Canada</p>
          <p>After a week of price data that showed inflation is moderating yet still high, key reports in the US will be centered around housing.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday, the government will issue figures on March housing starts and building permits. Existing-home sales follow on Thursday.</p>
          <p>The Federal Reserve will also release its Beige Book that outlines recent economic conditions by region. John Williams, Raphael Bostic, Loretta Mester and Lisa Cook are among the Fed officials speaking in the coming week, prior to the central bank’s blackout period that precedes their May 2-3 policy meeting.</p>
          <p>Further north, a fresh batch of inflation data on Tuesday will provide an early test of the Bank of Canada’s updated economic forecasts.</p>
          <p>Asia</p>
          <p>Japan hosts Group of Seven foreign ministers including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken through Tuesday, with officials expected to discuss economic coercion and other geopolitical issues. The group’s energy ministers this weekend reached a deal to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels but failed to agree on a deadline to exit coal and left the door open for new natural gas investments.</p>
          <p>Minutes from Australia’s central bank, out Tuesday, will offer more clues to the thinking behind its recent rate pause.</p>
          <p>The Bank of Indonesia is expected to keep interest rates unchanged for a third-straight meeting later in the day, while New Zealand gives its latest quarterly price growth figures on Thursday.</p>
          <p>Singapore, Indonesia and Japan provide trade figures during the week, although South Korea’s preliminary numbers for April will offer the freshest pulse check.</p>
          <p>Japan’s inflation release on Friday is likely to show a further cooling of prices ahead of a Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda’s first meeting the following week.</p>
          <p>Europe, Middle East, Africa</p>
          <p>Lagarde takes center stage, kicking off the week with an interview Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” in the US — where she was attending spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund — before appearing at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Monday.</p>
          <p>At least nine other Governing Council members, including chief economist Philip Lane and Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, are also scheduled to speak.</p>
          <p>The ECB publishes the account of its March rate decision, when policymakers shrugged off banking turmoil and raised rates while holding off on committing to future steps.</p>
          <p>Flash PMIs at the end of the week will show whether sentiment in Europe continued to improve early in the second quarter despite tumult in the banking sector.</p>
          <p>In the UK, inflation will probably tumble out of double digits for the first time in seven months when figures for March are posted on Wednesday. Wage data may show the pace of increases slowed in the latest three-month period.</p>
          <p>Together, economists expect those two reports to build the case for the Bank of England to bring to an end its quickest series of interest rate increases in three decades. Remarks by rate setters Jon Cunliffe, Catherine Mann and Silvana Tenreyro will be watched for potential clues.</p>
          <p>Data on Wednesday will likely show inflation in South Africa exceeded the 6% ceiling of the central bank’s target range for an 11th month. Forward-rate agreements for the next meeting on May 25 — used to speculate on South African borrowing costs — show expectations for a 25-basis-point increase in the repo rate to 8%.</p>
          <p>On the same day, Namibian policymakers are forecast to increase borrowing costs by 50 basis points to rein in high inflation and safeguard the nation’s currency peg with neighboring South Africa’s rand.</p>
          <p>Latin America</p>
          <p>Weak manufacturing has weighed on Brazil’s industrial production, still below pre-pandemic levels, so look for the February print to present more downbeat data. Brazil since 2014 has averaged negative industrial output results, the worst performance among the region’s five big economies.</p>
          <p>Banco Central do Brasil’s January GDP-proxy reading for Latin America’s biggest economy will likely show a slight expansion. Looking ahead, it may not get much better: local economists see growth of just 0.9% in 2023 and sub-par performance at least through 2026.</p>
          <p>In Colombia, February economic activity data reported on Tuesday will likely reflect some of the slowing that has analysts marking down their 2023 forecasts.</p>
          <p>The minutes of Banco Central de Chile’s April 4 meeting will likely find policymakers recommitting to a higher-for-longer mode with the key rate now at 11.25%. Inflation peaked at 14.1% in August but has slowed just 300 basis points since, prompting the bank to push back against speculation that monetary easing might begin any time soon.</p>
          <p>The central banks of Uruguay and Paraguay each hold interest rate meetings in the coming week. Both banks have hit their terminal rates and inflation is slowing, while remaining above each nation’s respective targets.</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>(Bloomberg) -- Investors worried about the Bank of Japan’s threat to global markets have a chance to hear from those on the front lines in coming weeks.</p>
            <p>Japan’s life insurers, with combined assets of $2.9 trillion, will lay out their investment strategies for the fiscal year which began this month. A key constituent of the country’s investor base, their plans for foreign and domestic markets this year will help shine a light on how Japanese funds are positioning for a potential BOJ policy tweak.</p>	
            <p>For months now, investors have bet that the central bank will start to normalize its ultra-easy monetary policy and change its yield-curve control program as inflation accelerates. That’s led to higher Japanese bond yields, making them more attractive to insurers who face expensive hedging costs and losses on foreign securities.</p>	
            <p>Insurers sold a record ¥14.2 trillion ($107 billion) of foreign bonds in the previous fiscal year while buying ¥4.99 trillion of local equivalents in the first 11 months, according to the latest data. That made up a big part of Japan’s record foreign bond outflows in 2022, which sent a chill through holders of everything from US government bonds to Brazilian debt, where the country’s funds are big investors.</p>
          <p>A $3 Trillion Threat to Global Financial Markets Looms in Japan</p>
          <p>Market watchers are bracing for volatility, should Japanese investors increase their sales of foreign securities and bring some of that cash home. Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc., a life insurer with one of Japan’s largest institutional portfolios, said last month that it’s shifting more money to domestic bonds from US Treasuries and other foreign securities.</p>
          <p>Some strategists expect the insurers to stay focused on domestic bonds, particularly longer-dated ones, with hedging costs for foreign investment still at elevated levels. Others see the potential for the overseas outflows to reverse, with the Federal Reserve expected to moderate the pace of its rate hikes and new BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda seen eventually tweaking policy.</p>
          <p>Mizuho Securities Co. Chief Desk Strategist Shoki Omori expects life insurers to stay focused on domestic debt partly because they need to hold an additional ¥35 trillion of long-maturity Japanese government bonds to meet asset-liability management requirements by April 2025, when a new solvency regime will be implemented. In addition, controlling currency risk is too expensive now.</p>
          <p>“They will continue to be cautious on overseas bonds as they see high grade bonds including sovereigns such as Treasuries being too rich on both a hedged and unhedged basis,” Tokyo-based Omori said. “Hedging costs are too high at around 5% and the dollar-yen is too high to go outright at current levels.”</p>
          <p>While Ueda has said he doesn’t plan any immediate changes to policy, global credit investors should be particularly nervous, according to Citigroup Inc. Strategists Daniel Sorid and James Keefe see Japanese outflows spreading from Treasuries and agency bond markets, if the BOJ adjusts its curve control policy and local yields rise.</p>
          <p>“The next wave of foreign bond reductions by Japanese life insurers could more squarely hit corporate bond demand,” they said.</p>
          <p>Higher yields in Japan would favor the local corporate bond market, according to Tomoaki Shintani, chief fund manager of the credit research department at Fukoku Capital Management Inc.</p>
          <p>“If domestic yields start rising, it makes sense to allocate money to domestic credit to some extent while reducing risks in foreign bonds,” he said.</p>
          <p>Japan’s Dai-ichi Life Turns $260 Billion Portfolio to JGBs</p>
          <p>Still, others see it differently. Investor focus has shifted to when the Fed will pause or even roll back its rate hikes if the US economy slows, adding to the allure of havens like Treasuries, especially with Japan’s yields so low on an absolute basis. The US 10-year note yields around 3 percentage points more than its Japanese counterpart.</p>
          <p>“Should I be a fund manager at a life insurance company, there probably is no choice but to pour funds into foreign debt,” said Jun Kato, chief market analyst at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Japanese yields will eventually rise, making it hard to buy them now.”</p>
          <p>For Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., the shift in investor sentiment also suggests equities won’t find favor with the insurers.</p>
          <p>“As the global economy is showing signs of a slowdown, they are unlikely to aggressively add to stock holdings,” she said.</p>
          <p>Sera suggests the level of the yen, which has slipped about 1% this year to around 132.50 per dollar, and yields on Japan’s longer-dated bonds will be key determinants of where the lifers invest their cash. The Japanese 30-year yield was around 1.3% on Friday, up from about 0.9% a year ago.</p>
          <p>“It’s hard to aggressively construct hedged foreign-bond positions and so, they may buy foreign bonds when the yen strengthens to 120s,” she said. “Super-long JGBs where yields have gone up compared with last year seem to be attractive for them as well.”</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks on Wall Street dipped Friday as worries about interest rates overshadowed an encouraging start to earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 fell 8.58 points, or 0.2%, to 4,137.64 after giving up an early gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 143.22, or 0.4%, to 33,886.47, while the Nasdaq composite sank 42.81, or 0.4%, to 12,123.47.</p>	
            <p>The S&P 500 still squeezed out a fourth winning week in the last five, built in part on hopes the Federal Reserve may soon end its barrage of rate hikes as inflation cools. High interest rates can stifle inflation but only by slowing the economy, raising the risk of a recession and dragging on prices for investments.</p>	
            <p>A top Fed official dampened those hopes Friday after saying inflation remains far too high and more tightening may be needed. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board, also said that even after hikes to rates end, they will likely need to stay high for longer than markets expect.</p>
          <p>After his comments, traders built bets that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting in May, instead of taking its first pause in more than a year. Some also began betting the Fed may hike rates again in June, according to data from CME Group.</p>
          <p>High-growth stocks tend to be among the most hurt by high rates, and Big Tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Microsoft fell 1.3%.</p>
          <p>Swaths of the economy have already begun slowing under the weight of higher interest rates, raising worries that a recession may be likely. A report on Friday showed U.S. shoppers cut their spending at retailers by more last month than expected. Much of that was due to falling gasoline prices, and the drop for what economists call “core retail sales” wasn't as bad as forecast.</p>
          <p>“The Fed’s challenge has been to cool inflation without putting the economy into a deep freeze in the process,” said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. “The dynamic is still playing out in the markets, and we could see more choppy price action as a result.”</p>
          <p>Potentially making things more difficult for the Fed was another report Friday that said U.S. households are girding for higher inflation. Consumers are expecting inflation over the next year of 4.6%, up from expectations for 3.6% a month earlier, according to a preliminary survey by the University of Michigan.</p>
          <p>That could be troublesome, as the Fed has long feared entrenched expectations of high inflation could lead to a vicious cycle that keeps it high. Longer-term expectations for inflation, though, remain stable and clocked in at 2.9% for a fifth straight month, according to the survey.</p>
          <p>All the worries helped push Treasury yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.51% from 3.45% late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.</p>
          <p>The two-year Treasury yield moves more on expectations for the Fed, and its gain was sharper, up to 4.10% from 3.97%.</p>
          <p>Helping to offset some of the worries about rates were big gains by several of the nation's biggest banks. They reported profits for the first three months of the year that blew past expectations.</p>
          <p>They helped kick off the reporting season for big U.S. companies, where expectations are mostly dismal. Despite such worries, JPMorgan Chase jumped 7.6% after its profit surged by more than half from a year earlier.</p>
          <p>It benefited from the strains unearthed in the banking system last month that shook global markets. Those worries pushed some customers to pull cash from smaller banks and move it to bigger ones.</p>
          <p>Citigroup rose 4.8% after it also reported stronger profit than expected. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, rose 3.1% after its earnings likewise topped forecasts.</p>
          <p>Boeing was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Its stock slid 5.6% after the aircraft maker said Thursday that production and delivery of a “significant number” of its 737 Max planes could be delayed because of questions about a supplier’s work on the fuselages.</p>
          <p>Boeing said the supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, used a “non-standard manufacturing process” during installation of fittings near the rear of some 737s. Boeing said the situation is not an immediate safety issue and planes already flying “can continue operating safely.”</p>

            <p>Morgan Stanley forecasts a downturn coming for US stocks, with the S&P 500 dropping over 20% later this year amid a looming earnings recession and fallout in the banking sector.</p>
            <p>Mike Wilson, the Wall Street giant's US chief equity strategist, reiterated his base-case scenario for the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,900, about 6% below current levels. His bear case is 3,600, and his bull case is 4,200.</p>	
            <p>But along the way, he still expects the gauge to hit a trough of 3,000-3,300 for this cycle, representing a decline of more than 20%.</p>	
            <p>"That path to 3,900 still goes through the low 3,000s ultimately," Wilson told Bloomberg TV on Thursday.</p>
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening campaign, US stocks have remained fairly resilient. The S&P 500 is up 8% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq Composite has surged 17% in the same time frame.</p>
          <p>The slew of bank failures in March and subsequent contagion fears, however, don't bode well for corporate earnings.</p>
          <p>"We're in the earnings recession camp. So whether we have an economic recession or not it isn't as important as the earnings recession," Wilson said. "The earnings situation is way worse than what the consensus thinks... The banking stress only makes us even more confident of that."</p>
          <p>JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are kicking off earnings season on Friday. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect US corporate profits to post their biggest decline since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p>

            <h3>By Carolina Mandl</h3>
            <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds increased their exposure to stocks in the financial sector amid the banking turmoil in March, as they saw a buying opportunity at lower prices, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a note on Thursday.</p>
            <p>"Hedge funds used the bank stress as an early buying opportunity, dismissing speculation that a significant crisis was at play," S&P said, adding the firms boosted their exposure to financials by 5.5%, after having reduced it by 3.9% in February. Retail investors also increased their bets by 1%.</p>	
            <p>Hedge funds raised their exposure to financials more than any other sector, according to S&P, which tracks assets listed in the U.S.. Hedge funds added $13.5 billion in stocks in all sectors in March.</p>	
            <p>Hedge funds' positioning in the banking sector came in a month when U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed, followed by Credit Suisse's rescue.</p>
          <p>"The group saw an opportunity to pick up banking names at a significant decline and, in order to do so, sold down holdings in the better-performing materials and energy sectors," Christopher Blake, executive director of S&P Global Issuer Solutions wrote.</p>
          <p>Citadel, one of the world's most profitable hedge funds, said in March in a regulatory filing it bought a 5.3% stake in Western Alliance Bancorporation, which was seen as a sign of confidence in the battered sector.</p>
          <p>Traditional asset managers, another group of investors tracked by S&P, cut their positioning in financials by 1.1% and also slashed $20.2 billion in equities stakes across other sectors.</p>
          <p>Overall, the financials sector has not recovered from the losses. The KBW Bank Index and the S&P 500 Banks Index are down 18.6% and 12.9% year to date, respectively, and both are roughly flat in April.</p>

            <p>The IMF says banking issues appear contained for now and that inflation is the bigger risk and top concern for central bankers and attendees of the IMF/World Bank spring meetings this week in Washington.</p>
            <p>“Financial stability risks have been contained so far and hopefully that will remain the case,” Tobias Adrian, director of the monetary and capital markets department of the IMF, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “As a result, monetary policy can focus on fighting inflation and that's a desirable outcome.”</p>	
            <p>Stress in financial markets has complicated the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving to be more persistent than anticipated. Adrian says inflation remains well above target both in the Euro area and in the US right now, noting that the US consumer price index excluding volatile food and energy prices actually went up.</p>	
            <p>Adrian’s advice for central banks: “…stay the course in terms of tightening until there is significant progress of getting inflation back to target.”</p>
          <p>He added, “There's certainly upside risk to the path of interest rates and there's upside risk to inflation. It remains a precarious situation.”</p>
          <p>The second biggest topic central bankers and meeting attendees are buzzing about this week is stress in the financial system, following the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks in the US and Credit Suisse in Switzerland. Adrian says overall financial stability is being tested for first time since the 2008 global financial crisis as monetary policy tightens and that after many years of low interest rates vulnerabilities have been building.</p>
          <p>“I think that systemic risk has been contained to date and I'm confident in the crisis management toolkit that we have,” says Adrian, referring to backstops the Federal Reserve and FDIC employed to stop contagion from Silicon Valley Bank’s failure. “But I would not be surprised if there were other episodes of turmoil both in banks and nonbank financial intermediaries.”</p>
          <p>The IMF warned in its Financial Stability report released Tuesday that the risks of tighter monetary and financial conditions could be amplified because of financial leverage, mismatches in asset and liability liquidity, and a high degree of interconnectedness between the nonbank financial intermediation sector and traditional banking institutions.</p>
          <p>It argues this raises the specter of stress in some sectors—such as venture capital, technology, and commercial real estate sectors—that have been particularly hit by the removal of ample liquidity.</p>
          <p>The IMF estimates any kind of tightening seen in March as a result of bank failures will ultimately shave off about 0.5% of GDP. Adrian says that in some sense makes the job of the central bankers easier because they don't have to tighten as much as a result.</p>
          <p>The IMF warned Tuesday the risk of a recession has grown for advanced economies in the wake of bank failures in the U.S. and Europe while slightly lowering its outlook for global growth this year. The IMF projects the global economy will expand at 2.8% this year, a hair lower than its January estimate of 2.9%.</p>

          <p>Stock futures edge higher as traders dig through March jobs report; Week Ahead: Inflation data, big bank earnings in focus; First Republic suspends preferred dividend ahead of Q1 earnings; Tesla confirms Shanghai 'megapack' battery plant plans and Pioneer shares leap on report of Exxon takeover talks.</p>
          <h3>1. -- Stock Futures Edge Higher As Traders Dig Through March Jobs Report</h3>
          <p>U.S. equity futures edged higher Monday, while the dollar held steady against its global peers, as investors get their first chance to react to Friday's March jobs report and prep for a key inflation reading later in the week.</p>
          <p>The U.S. economy added 236,000 new jobs last month, a figure that takes the year-to-date tally to just over 1 million, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics revising its February estimate higher and its January figure lower. Wage data was also mixed, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3% on the month, matching Street forecasts, but slowing to 4.2% on the year compared with the 4.6% pace recorded in February.</p>
          <p>"Reading between the lines the moderate declines in specific sectors such as manufacturing and construction should be an encouraging sign to the Fed some effects of monetary policy are starting to take hold," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. "The data shouldn’t do much to sway the Fed in either direction, but taken in conjunction with recent job openings data and weaker survey based data, the argument for a pause in rate hikes is building."</p>
          <p>Still, the odds of a March hike remain firm, with the CME Group's FedWatch indicating a 64% chance the Fed will lift its target rate to between 5% and 5.25%, although the market is also forecasting a September Fed cut as the economy turns south over the summer months.</p>
          <p>Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields were marked 3.363% in thin overnight trading, with many markets in Europe closed for the final Easter observances, while 2-year note yields were last seen trading at 3.931%.</p>
          <p>The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currency peers, was marked 0.08% lower at 102.013 after hitting a two-month of low 101.40 prior to Friday's jobs data.</p>
          <p>Heading into the start of the trading day on Wall Street, futures contacts tied to the S&P 500 are priced for a modest 1.5 point opening bell gain and those linked to Dow Jones Industrial Average are looking at a 25 point bump. Contacts tied to the tech-focused Nasdaq are indicating a 10 point decline.</p>
          <p>Overnight in Asia, the MSCI ex-Japan index was marked 0.18% higher into the close of trading while Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.42% in Tokyo.</p>
          <h3>2. -- Week Ahead: Inflation Data, Big Bank Earnings In Focus </h3>
          <p>Investors are likely to focus on a key inflation release later this week, as well as the unofficial start to the first quarter earnings season, for clues as to whether stocks can continue their impressive year-to-date gains in the face of mounting recession concerns.</p>
          <p>JPMorgan, Citigroup  (C) - Get Free Report and Wells Fargo  (WFC) - Get Free Report will form a trio of banks reporting first quarter profits before the market opens on Friday, with Dow component UnitedHealth  (UNH) - Get Free Report kicking things off that say day with its March quarter update at 6:00 am Eastern time.</p>
          <p>Collective S&P 500 profits are expected to fall 5.2% from last year to a share-weighted $419.1 billion, with the second quarter tally expected to show a year-on-year decline of around 4%.</p>
          <p>Wednesday's March inflation reading, however, will likely have more market impact as investors look to any signals of consumer price cooling following Friday's mixed March jobs report and a series of weaker-than-expected labor market readings.</p>
          <p>Economists are forecasting headline inflation will slow to an annualized rate of 5.2%, with the closely-tracked core reading at 5.5%, compared to readings of 6% and 5.5% respectively over the month of February.</p>
          <p>Producer price inflation figures are expected Thursday, alongside the regular weekly jobless claims release, with the Commerce Department's March retail sales report slated for Friday at 8:30 am Eastern time.</p>
          <h3>3. -- First Republic Suspends Preferred Dividend Ahead of Q1 Earnings</h3>
          <p>First Republic  (FRC) - Get Free Report shares moved lower in pre-market trading after the lender and wealth manager said it would suspend dividend payments on its preferred stock.</p>
          <p>First Republic, which paused common stock dividends last month, said suspending preferred share payouts was a "measure of prudent oversight" ahead of its first quarter earnings on April 24.</p>
          <p>First Republic is reportedly still looking to raise capital in order to shore-up its balance sheet, and it also considering selling some of its valuable loan book following a coordinated effort by a group of 11 banks, lead by JPMorgan  (JPM) - Get Free Report CEO Jamie Dimon, to add $30 billion to the lender's deposit base last month</p>
          <p>First Republic shares were marked 1.6% lower in pre-market trading to indicate an opening bell price of $13.81 each.</p>
          <h3>4. -- Tesla Confirms Shanghai 'Megapack' Battery Plant Plans</h3>
          <p>Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Free Report shares edged modestly higher in pre-market trading after the carmaker confirmed plans to build a major battery production site in Shanghai.</p>
          <p>The move, which deepens Tesla's investment in China amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, will see Tesla adding to its Shanghai 'gigafactory' later this year as it ramps-up battery production already underway in Lathrop, California.</p>
          <p>The new Shanghai factory will produce around 10,000 so-called 'megapack' units each year from 2024, the company said, a tally level to the firm's California output.</p>
          <p>Tesla will publish its first quarter earnings on April 19, after the market closes, with analysts looking for a bottom line of 85 cents per share on revenues of $23.375 billion.</p>
          <p>Tesla shares were marked 0.14% higher in pre-market trading to indicate an opening bell price of $185.40 each..</p>
          <h3>5. -- Pioneer Shares Leap On Report of Exxon Takeover Talks</h3>
          <p>Pioneer Natural Resources  (PXD) - Get Free Report shares moved firmly higher in pre-market trading following reports of possible takeover interest from Exxon Mobil  (XOM) - Get Free Report.</p>
          <p>The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that Exxon has held informal talks with the Irving, Texas-based shale producer about a possible acquisition, with the paper citing the group as a "top target" for the use of its recent windfall profits from last year's energy price surge.</p>
          <p>Exxon posted record profits of $56 billion last year, with fourth quarter earnings powered by both a jump in crude and a surge in U.S. gas prices. CEO Darren Woods said the group would "continue to invest in our advantaged projects to deliver profitable growth" while remaining focused on cost cuts.</p>
          <p>Pioneer, for its part, denied a February report that it was linked to merger talks with rival producer Ranger Resources  (RRC) - Get Free Report, saying at the time that it is "not contemplating a significant business combination or other acquisition transaction."</p>
          <p>Pioneer shares were marked 6.6% higher in pre-market trading to indicate an opening bell price of $221.89 each.</p>

          <p>(Bloomberg) -- Chinese shares related to artificial intelligence plunged after a state media outlet urged authorities to step up supervision of potential speculation.</p>
          <p>The ChatGPT concept sector has “signs of a valuation bubble,” with many companies having made little progress in developing the technology, the Economic Daily wrote in a commentary Monday.</p>
          <p>Regulators should strengthen monitoring and crackdown on share-price manipulation and speculation to create “a well-disclosed and well-run market,” according to the newspaper, which runs a website officially recognized by Beijing. Companies, it said, should develop the capabilities they propose, while investors should refrain from speculating.</p>
          <p>CloudWalk Technology Co. tumbled a record 20%, while 360 Security Technology Inc. dropped by 10%, the most in three years. Beijing Haitian Ruisheng Science Technology Ltd. sank 15%.</p>
          <p>Since the release of ChatGPT, Chinese shares related to the technology have surged, with domestic big techs joining the race to develop generative AI. SenseTime Group Inc. last Tuesday rose the most in two months in Hong Kong amid speculation that the SoftBank Group Corp.-backed company was developing a product to challenge ChatGPT. Shares of Alibaba suppliers also jumped on reports that the tech giant will unveil its answer to ChatGPT.</p>
          <p>“Generative AI is the hottest trend now and many tech companies will be launching their own versions in the coming months,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “While valuations may rise to such news, the actual financial impact to these companies may be difficult to gauge at this juncture, and may lead to disappointment eventually.”</p>

          <p>By Herbert Lash</p>
          <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed mostly flat and the dollar rose on Monday after strong jobs data last week pointed to the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates in May, while the yen eased after Japan's new central bank governor vowed to maintain ultra-loose policy.</p>
          <p>Gold prices slipped below the key $2,000 level due to a resurgent dollar, while Treasury yields edged higher on growing market expectations that the Fed will hike rates when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting on May 3.</p>
          <p>Consumer price index data on Wednesday will encourage the market to see a rate hike next month, but more important reports on Thursday and Friday will show the extent of emergency funding for banks, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.</p>
          <p>"My sense is that the labor market and CPI would favor the Fed raising rates again. However, what has made the market have second thoughts is the extent of the tightening of lending."</p>
          <p>"We saw in the last two weeks there's a record decline in commercial and industry loans," Chandler said.</p>
          <p>Futures show a 71.7% likelihood that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points to a range of 5.0%-5.25% next month, CME Group's FedWatch tool shows.</p>
          <p>But recession worries have risen as commercial lending fell after the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March tightened credit conditions among U.S. banks. The Fed's emergency lending program has eased some of those concerns.</p>
          <p>Fed lending to banks over the past four weeks has increased more than $400 billion and offset nearly two-thirds of the quantitative tightening that began a year ago, said Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in New York.</p>
          <p>"To the extent the market has all this liquidity sloshing around, people get more confident that the Fed is going to be there to save us in some capacity," LaVorgna said. "The market is going to stay bid, it won't go down."</p>
          <p>Traders also are betting that the Fed will cut rates in the second half to ward off an economic downturn, but the two-year Treasury note's 4% rate and what will likely be a 5% Fed target rate is a "huge discrepancy" that cannot continue, LaVorgna said.</p>
          <p>Minutes of the Fed's policy meeting in March are also scheduled to be released on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>Trading was light as markets were closed in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong for Easter.</p>
          <p>The dollar index rose 0.52% and the two-year Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, added 4.2 basis points to 4.014%.</p>
          <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, the S&P 500 gained 0.10% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 0.11%.</p>
          <p>The dollar extended gains against the yen to 133.87, the highest since March 15, on receding expectations of a near-term tweak to Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy.</p>
          <p>Japan's new central bank Governor Kazuo Ueda said it was appropriate to maintain the bank's policy for now as inflation has yet to hit 2% as a trend, suggesting he will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus.</p>
          <p>The yen was weakened 1.08% at 133.57 per dollar.</p>
          <p>Asian shares were little changed. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.04%.</p>
          <p>In China, shares slipped, with the blue chip CSI300 Index 0.32% lower and the Shanghai Composite Index easing 0.16% on rising geopolitical tensions around the Taiwan Strait.</p>
          <p>China announced three days of drills on Saturday, after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen returned to Taipei following a meeting in Los Angeles with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy.</p>
          <p>U.S. gold futures settled down 1.1% at $1,989.10 an ounce.</p>
          <p>U.S. crude fell 96 cents to settle at $79.74 a barrel and Brent settled down 94 cents at $84.18 a barrel.</p>

        content: <div className="blog-content">
          <p>This FAANG stock-heavy index fund could skyrocket when the next bull market comes around.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 nosedived into a bear market last year as recession fears rattled Wall Street, and the benchmark index is still down 15% from all-time highs. But every bear market has ended in a new bull market, and the same outcome is all but inevitable this time around. That makes the current situation a buying opportunity for patient investors, and the FAANG stocks look attractive.</p>
          <p>All five FAANG stocks crushed the S&P 500 over the past decade, and each one retains solid prospects for future growth. Investors can get significant exposure to the FAANG stocks through a specific Vanguard index fund. Of course, buying the stocks outright is also an option, but three of the five underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years, while the Vanguard index fund in question outperformed.</p>
          <h3>The future looks bright for the FAANG stocks</h3>
          <p>The bull case for each FAANG stock is detailed below.</p>
          <p><strong>Apple (AAPL -1.60%)</strong>led the world in smartphone and smartwatch sales in the fourth quarter. Its lineup of trendy devices inspired immense consumer loyalty, and the company recently surpassed 2 billion active devices worldwide. That hints at strong growth for its services business in the coming years. Indeed, App Store spending is forecast to climb at 14% annually through 2026, and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet in the U.S., meaning Apple should be a major beneficiary as smartphone payments become more prevalent at physical points of sale.</p>
          <p><strong>Amazon (AMZN 0.11%)</strong>dominates the e-commerce industry. Its marketplace powered 38% of online retail sales in North America and Western Europe last year, and its massive logistics footprint gives the company an edge over its peers. But the company has more exciting growth prospects in the higher-margin industries of cloud computing and digital advertising. Amazon is the largest provider of cloud services, and it has quietly become the fourth-largest digital advertising company in the world in the world.</p>
          <p><strong>Alphabet (GOOG -1.79%) (GOOGL -1.83%)</strong>dominates the ad tech space, and its valuable internet real estate should keep it at the forefront of the industry for years to come. Google Search holds an astounding 93% share in internet search, which effectively makes it the gateway to the internet, and YouTube is the top U.S. streaming service as measured by viewing time. Additionally, Google Cloud Platform is the third-largest provider of cloud services.</p>
          <p><strong>Meta Platforms (META -0.62%)</strong>is the second-largest digital advertising company in the world. Its family of social media apps reached an incredible 3.7 billion people monthly in the fourth quarter, and Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook ranked among the 10 most downloaded mobile apps worldwide last year. Meta should be a major beneficiary of ongoing growth in digital ad spend, but its investments in generative AI and the metaverse could also pay off in the future.</p>
          <p><strong>Netflix (NFLX -0.10%)</strong>leads the streaming industry in global engagement, revenue, and profits, and its ability to create binge-worthy content far surpasses that of its peers. The company accounted for 40% of consumer demand for original content last year, more than the next five streaming services combined, and Netflix produced 13 of the top 15 original streaming programs. While the company eschewed advertising for years, its recent launch of an ad-support service significantly expands its total addressable market.</p>
          <h3>The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF</h3>
          <p>The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK -0.28%) tracks nearly 100 of the largest U.S. growth stocks. Its constituents include all five FAANG stocks, which collectively account for 31% of its weighted exposure, but it also includes Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia, which account for another 21% of its weighted exposure. That diversity makes the Vanguard ETF a little less risky than owning the FAANG stocks outright, though investors still get heavy FAANG exposure, as detailed below.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple: </strong>15.8%</li>
            <li><strong>Alphabet: </strong>7.1%</li>
            <li><strong>Amazon: </strong>5.8%</li>
            <li><strong>Meta Platforms: </strong>1.4%</li>
            <li><strong>Netflix: </strong>1.1%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF crushed the broader market over the past decade. While the S&P 500 produced a total return of 219%, the Vanguard ETF soared 280%, or 14.2% annually. If that pace continues, $200 invested weekly would grow into $203,000 over the next decade and $969,000 in two decades. Of course, annualized returns of 14.2% are probably unsustainable over a 20-year period, but investors can reasonably expect the Vanguard ETF to beat the broader market in the long run.</p>
          <p>The last thing investors need to know is that the Vanguard ETF bears a below-average expense ratio of 0.07%, meaning the annual fees would total $7 on a $10,000 portfolio. In short, this ETF is a cheap way to diversify across dozens of the biggest growth stocks on the market, which makes it a great option for risk-tolerant investors with a long time horizon.</p>

          <p>The major indexes held up well in a holiday-shortened trading week, with midweek pullbacks looking healthy and normal. But many sectors and leading stocks sold off hard, including Tesla stock</p>
          <p>Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) broke out Thursday. China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) flashed an aggressive entry.</p>
          <p>Google stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders, along with Microsoft (MSFT).</p>
          <p>The video embedded in the article discussed the weekly market action and analyzed Google, BABA stock and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).</p>
          <h3>Jobs Report</h3>
          <p>The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000, just below estimates for 240,000. That's down from February's revised 326,000.</p>
          <p>Private payrolls rose just 189,000. well below views for 223,000. Manufacturing jobs unexpectedly dipped 1,000.</p>
          <p>The jobless rate unexpectedly dipped to 3.5%, back to long-term lows. However, the labor force participation rate climbed to a post-Covid high of 62.6%.</p>
          <p>Hourly earnings rose 0.3% vs. February, in line. The annual gain cooled to 4.2%, below views for 4.3% and the lowest in years.</p>
          <p>The average workweek unexpectedly shortened, to 34.4 hours.</p>
          <p>Despite the slower wage gains and private hiring, the odds of a Fed rate hike in May rose to 65% Thursday morning from 49% on Wednesday.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value, reversing from slim losses before the jobs report. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures edged higher.</p>
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield popped 7 basis points to 3.36%.</p>
          <p>Stock futures stop trading at 9:15 a.m. ET.</p>
          <p>U.S. stock markets are closed in observance of Good Friday.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong and European markets are closed for Good Friday and Easter Monday.</p>
          <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
          <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
          <p>The stock market rally had a mixed week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% in  weekly stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1%. The Nasdaq fell 1.1% and the Russell 2000 slumped 2.5%.</p>
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices leapt 6.65% to $80.92 a barrel, mostly on Monday after the surprise OPEC+ output cut. Crude futures have surged 20.9% in three weeks.</p>
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled 22 basis points to 3.28%, hitting seven-month lows.</p>
          <h3>Growth ETFs</h3>
          <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 3.5% for the week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 1.6%. Microsoft stock is a major IGV holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gave up 4.1%.</p>
          <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) skidded 4.4% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) dropped 1.2%, though both rose Thursday. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
          <h3>Tesla Price Cuts</h3>
          <p>Tesla cut U.S. prices on all its EVs overnight. It reduced Model S and X prices for the third time this year, both by $5,000 in this instance. The Model S starts at $84,990 while the Model X now begins at $94,990.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Tesla trimmed U.S. Model 3 prices by $1,000 to an entry price of $41,990. The Model Y was cut $2,000 to $49,990.</p>
          <p>Earlier in the week, Tesla cut Model 3 and Y prices in Australia once again.</p>
          <p>Tesla slashed global prices in January, with further U.S. cuts on its S and X vehicles and additional European discounts in March. That, along with new U.S. EV credits, pushed first-quarter Tesla deliveries to a new record. But they fell short of FactSet views. Production exceeded deliveries once again, with Model S and X output nearly twice as high as sales.</p>
          <p>Many analysts predicted further Tesla price cuts to support demand, further cutting its prized margins</p>
          <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
          <p>Investors won't get a chance to react to the latest Tesla price cut until Monday. But Tesla stock tumbled 10.8% to 185.06 this week following the Q1 delivery report. Shares plunged below a 200.76 cup-with-handle buy point and the 50-day moving average.</p>
          <p>The base had formed below the 200-day line, which is not great. The 200.76 buy point is no longer valid, but TSLA stock is working on a new handle, already present on a weekly chart, with a 207.89 entry. Of course, the 200-day line still looms just above that.</p>
          <p>Tesla earnings for the first quarter are due April 19, when investors will see how price cuts have hit profit margins so far.</p>
          <h3>Google Stock</h3>
          <p>Google jumped 3.8% on Thursday to 108.42 in above-normal volume. Shares rallied past a cup-with-handle buy point of 106.69 according to MarketSmith analysis.</p>
          <p>Google's CEO said the company will add a chat AI to its search engine soon, after Microsoft (MSFT) added ChatGPT to its Bing search engine and other products.</p>
          <h3>Alibaba Stock</h3>
          <p>Alibaba stock popped 4.25% on Thursday to 102.74, breaking the downtrend of a handle, offering an early entry. The new handle is above the 50-day line but fractionally too low in the base to be considered proper.</p>
          <p>BABA stock surged in the prior week after Alibaba said it would split into six different units with their own CEOs and the option of filing for IPOs.</p>
          <h3>Stock Market Rally Analysis</h3>
          <p>The stock market rally had a normal and healthy pullback on the major indexes during the week.</p>
          <p>The Nasdaq fell, but recovered the 12,000 level Thursday. The S&P 500 edged lower while the Dow Jones moved higher.</p>
          <p>Google stock had a solid week and Meta Platforms (META) kept rising. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft stock were little changed, at the edge of buy zones. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH) had big weekly gains.</p>
          <p>But there were a lot of big losers. Construction and industrial-related groups tumbled Tuesday while growth stocks sold off Wednesday. Many suffered significant damage, while others could move back into position relatively soon. Thursday's rebounds, often from key levels, were definitely encouraging.</p>
          <p>Defensive growth and defensive names had a strong week, including medicals, consumer staples and utilities.</p>
          <p>Will those areas continue to do well if a "risk-on" mentality returns?</p>

          <p>April 6 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes ended higher on Thursday, helped by a rally in Alphabet shares as investors, worried about a slowing economy, looked to upcoming jobs data.</p>
          <p>Alphabet Inc rallied 3.8% and Microsoft climbed 2.6%, with both providing more fuel than any other stocks for the S&P 500's gain for the session. Alphabet's Google unit plans to add artificial intelligence features to its search engine, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
          <p>Adding to recent data hinting at a weak labor market, initial jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ended April 1, versus expectations of 200,000 claims.</p>
          <p>The Labor Department's data from the prior week was revised to show 48,000 more applications were received.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 climbed 0.36% to end the session at 4,105.02 points.</p>
          <p>The Nasdaq gained 0.76% to 12,087.96 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 33,485.29 points.</p>
          <p>Wall Street has lost ground in recent days in response to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings earlier this week.</p>
          <p>That marked a change from recent months, when investors cheered weak economic data on the basis that it might mean the Fed's interest rate hikes were working and that the Fed could ease up on its campaign to rein in decades-high inflation.</p>
          <p>Interest rate futures imply traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise its target rate or keep it steady at its upcoming May meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.</p>
          <p>"The market is trying to decide whether the 'growth and recession' scare or the 'Fed hiking' scare are more meaningful to prices, and so it's waffling between whether a softening labor market is good news because it gets the Fed to pause in May or bad news because it means the recession is actually coming," said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
          <p>Investors are now focused on the more comprehensive report on non-farm payrolls, which are expected to have increased by 239,000 in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month. That report is due on Friday, when the U.S. stock market will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.</p>
          <p>Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight rose, led by communication services, up 1.71%, followed by a 0.74% gain in utilities.</p>
          <p>With some investors away during a shortened holiday week, volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 12.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.</p>
          <p>For the week, the S&P 500 declined 0.1%, the Dow added 0.6% and the Nasdaq lost 1.1%.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>U.S. stocks marched upward Thursday, with tech stocks leading the Nasdaq higher than other indexes, after fresh data pointed to a gradual softening of labor market conditions ahead of the highly anticipated Friday jobs report.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered just above the flatline. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.8%.</p>
          <p>The stock and bond markets will both close for Good Friday on April 7.</p>
          <p>Government bond yields were higher. The yield on the 10-year note was up slightly, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields climbed to 3.82% Thursday.</p>
          <p>On the commodities front, gold futures (GC=F) are shining right now after the metal managed to break the $2,000-per-ounce barrier on the back of weak U.S. economic data, as well as hopes that the Fed will raise rates more slowly.</p>
          <p>Crude oil (CL=F) continues to hover around $80 a barrel, little changed after big gains to start the week. At the same time, gas prices nationwide have notched up to a five-month high, surpassing $3.50 per gallon, according to data from AAA. The jump comes as the OPEC+ coalition, in a surprise decision last weekend, decided to cut oil production.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose by 228,000 for the week ended April 1, the Labor Department data reported, higher than consensus estimates of 200,000. The prior week was revised up to 246,000 given the government's updated seasonal factors. Continuing claims were also revised up for the week ending March 18 from 1.689 million to 1.823 million.</p>
          <p>This comes after a report Wednesday from the private payroll firm ADP showed that employers added 145,000 jobs in March as the labor market showed signs of slowing from its strong pace so far this year.</p>
          <p>That figure was well below the consensus estimates of 210,000 and lower than the revised 261,000 jobs gained in February. But market strategists say it's unclear if ADP’s results foreshadow a softer nonfarm payrolls report Friday, where Wall Street's attention now turns.</p>
          <p>Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Friday's jobs report to show 240,000 jobs created last month. This would be significantly lower than the average job gains of 343,000 over the last six months.</p>
          <p>In additional jobs data earlier this week, the government's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) found that openings receded more than expected to 9.931 million, marking the first time the number dropped below 10 million since May 2021.</p>
          <p>The gradual slowing in the labor market may be encouraging for policymakers. Some investors are maintaining “a fairly dovish path” from the Fed over the coming months.</p>
          <p>“For instance, at the next meeting in May, the chances of a rate hike according to futures remained at 47%, after having been as high as 70% earlier in the week,” Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday she predicts rates will need to move higher.</p>
          <p>"Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down," Mester said in a speech at the Money Marketeers of New York University.</p>
          <p>Markets on Thursday seemed to welcome the comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who cooled fears that the recent bank failures will send the economy into a recession.</p>
          <p>Separately, the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday that the global economy will grow less 3% this year, the lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990.</p>
          <p>In single-stock moves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) shares slid after the retailer reported softer-than-expected March sales amid a slowdown in discretionary spending from consumers.</li>
            <li>Shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) moved upward after the company expanded its cloud computing partnership with Microsoft to government agencies.</li>
            <li>CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose Thursday following an investor day on Tuesday during which hinted at coming up short on medium-term growth and profit outlook.</li>
            <li>Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) surged after Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled against a share conversion settlement.</li>
            <li>Constellation Brands (STZ) shares gained after the company reported results that beat analyst expectations and increased its quarterly dividend.</li>
            <li>Shares of Levi's (LEVI) plunged 16% after the retailer reported a drop in quarterly profit. The company maintained full-year guidance.</li>
            <li>Airbnb (ABNB) shares were on the downswing Thursday after a publication reported that top professional hosts are building out their own booking platforms and offering discounts to cut out Airbnb.</li>
            <li>Shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and (GOOGL) rose as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai remains bullish that Google's search engine can hold its ground against a ChatGPT-led AI onslaught. The company giant plans to add chat functionality to Google Search, according to the Wall Street Journal.</li>
            <li>Elsewhere on the earnings front, WD-40 (WDFC), Lamb Weston (LW), and RPM (RPM) are also set to report on Thursday.</li>

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday morning after a surprise jump in the Labor Department's weekly first-time jobless claims.  Meanwhile, membership warehouse retailer Costco (COST) slid more than 3% after reporting its first monthly same-store sales drop in nearly three years.</p>
          <p>Early Thursday, initial unemployment claims came in at 228,000. Economists expected a slight rise to 201,000. But the prior week was revised up sharply to 246,000 from 198,000.</p>
          <p>Late Wednesday, Costco said global same-store sales fell 1.1% in March. The last time those sales fell was in April 2020. Costco said U.S. same-store sales fell 1.5% in March, and there was a 2.4% decrease in Canada. Internationally, those sales rose 2%. E-commerce comparable sales slid 12.7%.</p>
          <p>On the earnings front, Constellation Brands (STZ) and Levi Strauss (LEVI) offered results Thursday.</p>
          <p>STZ stock rose 1% after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results, while Levi shares fell more than 12% despite narrowly beating views.</p>

          <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column with the stock market in an uptrend.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Boeing, Cisco Systems, Nike</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones leader Boeing is nearing a flat base's 221.43 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. Shares fell 1.8% Wednesday, still holding above their 50-day line. BA stock fell 0.4% early Thursday.</p>
          <p>Cisco Systems broke out past a flat base's 51.84 buy point during last week's advance. Bullishly, the stock's relative strength line hit a new high in recent weeks, a sign of market outperformance. Shares lost 1.6% Thursday.</p>
          <p>Nike shares continue to see stout resistance around their 50-day line, falling 2.3% Wednesday. They continue to trace a flat base that has a 131.41 buy point. An early entry at 126.16 is also in play. NKE stock moved 1.5% Thursday.</p>
          <h3>Top Stocks To Buy And Watch: Axon, ServiceNow, Southern Copper</h3>
          <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Axon closed further below a 226.10 buy point Wednesday in a short consolidation with a 2.6% drop. Meanwhile, it also gave up an early entry at 221.79, above the March 21 high. AXON stock was down 0.7% Thursday.</p>

          <p>Backstory: NOW software tracks and manages services provided by information-technology departments.

          <p>Microsoft shares surged earlier this month after the company announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications suite. That follows the company's investments in artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzworthy ChatGPT application.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>(Bloomberg) -- European and US equity futures rose alongside Asian shares as the Hong Kong market rallied on a planned revamp of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. that bodes well for Chinese technology companies.</p>
          <p>Contracts for the region-wide Euro Stoxx 50 equity benchmark moved around 0.4% higher, broadly in line with an advance in US futures that effectively canceled a decline Tuesday. A gauge of Asian stocks rose for a second day as benchmarks in Japan and Australia also increased.</p>
          <p>Investors rushed back to Alibaba shares and other large tech companies that have been stung by a crackdown from Beijing over the past two years. Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares surged around 14%, tracking a jump in its US-listed stock after the e-commerce giant said it would split into six units in a shakeup that promises to yield multiple initial public offerings.</p>
          <p>The Hang Seng Index advanced around 2% and a measure of Hong Kong-listed tech firms jumped about 3% in an updraft that buoyed Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc., and Japan-listed Softbank Group Corp., which owns a large stake in Alibaba.</p>
          <p>Treasuries were little changed in Asian trading after the two-year yield rose eight basis points and the 10-year equivalent climbed four basis points Tuesday.</p>
          <p>An index of the dollar edged higher after ending Tuesday near the lowest level in eight weeks. The Australian dollar weakend after slower-than-forecast inflation data bolstered the case for the central bank to pause its run of interest-rate increases.</p>
          <p>Investors are preparing for a raft of data on the US economy this week, including the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation — the so-called core PCE deflator — which is likely to factor into the Federal Reserve’s next policy decision.</p>
          <p>St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said “appropriate monetary policy can continue to put downward pressure on inflation” despite the turmoil in US regional banks. Meanwhile, consumers appear to have shrugged off the bank failures, with the latest consumer confidence figures unexpectedly higher in March.</p>
          <p>Swaps traders have priced in more than a 50% probability the Fed will raise rates by a quarter point at its next meeting, with plans to ease thereafter. However, several strategists have joined BlackRock Investment Institute in saying markets are wrong in expecting imminent rate cuts.</p>
          <p>“The banking crisis and the new tighter standards for banks is equivalent to one to two rate hikes,” said Eva Ados, chief investment strategist for ERShares, in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There is a big possibility here of a pricing mistake. We are pricing in the rate drop rather than the reason why rates are dropping, which is the banking crisis.”</p>
          <p>Underscoring how much disruption has been caused by the turmoil in the banking sector, UBS Group AG said Sergio Ermotti would return as chief executive officer. He’s replacing Ralph Hamers after just over two years in charge as the UBS looks to the veteran banker to oversee the complicated acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere, oil was higher after a clash between Iraq and its Kurdish region curtailed exports. Gold fell slightly and Bitcoin traded around $27,400.</p>
          <p>Key events this week:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>EIA Crude Oil Inventory Report, Wednesday</li>
            <li>Eurozone economic confidence, consumer confidence, Thursday</li>

          <h3>Nasdaq Falls, IBD 50 Lags</h3>
          <p>The Nasdaq closed off lows for the day but still fell 0.5%. EV stock Lucid (LCID) underperformed here with a dip of 7.2%.</p>
          <p>The benchmark S&P 500 also fell despite rallying into the close. It fell 0.2%. It continues to lag the 50-day moving average. Humana (HUM) was a laggard here as it skidded 4.7%.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 sectors finished the session mixed, with energy and industrials making the best gains. Communications services, health and technology suffered.</p>
          <p>Small caps barely fell, with the Russell 2000 dipping 0.1%. Growth stocks struggled the most, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) down 1.5%.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Today: Microsoft, Apple Stock Fall Again</h3>
          <p>The Dow Jones industrials also slipped, though not as sharply as the other major indexes. It closed down less than 40 points, or 0.1%.</p>
          <p>Microsoft fought back heading into the close, but still slid 0.4% as Big Tech stocks continued to cede some recent gains. It lost ground on a 276.86 entry, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
          <p>Apple also toiled, easing 0.4%. Despite this, it remains clear of its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It also managed to end the session above its 10-day line.</p>
          <p>American Express (AXP) was the worst stock on the Dow Jones today as it fell 2.4%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) led the upside with a gain of 2.7%.</p>
          <h3>These Stocks Struggle Despite Cathie Wood Buys</h3>
          <p>Famed money manager Cathie Wood is never afraid to buy on the dip, but the strategy had mixed luck for three new buys Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Cryptocurrency stock Coinbase reversed higher, gaining 0.8%. It is trading near the 50-day moving average. Wood's signature ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) snapped up more than 32,000 shares Monday.</p>
          <p>It came as bitcoin, the most famous digital currency of all, also reversed higher. It also rose 0.8% and remains up nearly 65% for the year.</p>
          <p>Teladoc Health (TDOC) fell 1%, though it closed slightly off the day's lows. It is trading below its major moving averages. ARKK added more than 18,000 shares.</p>
          <p>Joby Aviation (JOBY) also fell 1%, though also off lows. The ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) bought 448,000 shares. This cheap stock does not meet CAN SLIM criteria.</p>
          <h3>Alibaba Stock Goes On Magic Carpet Ride</h3>
          <p>BABA stock soared on news it is splitting itself into six separate business groups. Investors seem excited by the fact that each of these groups could potentially go public to raise outside funding.</p>
          <p>The six are: Cloud Intelligence, Cloud Commerce, Local Services, Cainiao Smart Logistics, Global Digital Commerce Group and Digital Media and Entertainment.</p>
          <p>Each group will have its own board of directors and CEO. The move is "designed to unlock shareholder value and foster market competitiveness," according to a statement from the company.</p>
          <p>The China stock rocketed 14.3%, taking investors on a magic carpet ride in the process. Alibaba stock is now up 7% so far in 2023.</p>
          <h3>Micron Earnings Miss; MU Stock Up Late</h3>
          <p>Chip giant Micron Technology (MU) inched higher after the close following earnings.</p>
          <p>The stock closed lower heading into its report, sliding about 1%. But in extended trading it was up almost 2%. It is testing support at the 50-day moving average. The memory-chip maker is up nearly 18% so far in 2023.</p>
          <p>Micron earnings per share were seen falling from $2.14 last year to a loss of 67 cents this year, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue was expected to dip 52% to $3.76 billion.</p>
          <p>Instead, the Boise, Idaho-based company lost an adjusted $1.91 cents a share on sales of $3.69 billion.</p>
          <p>Micron makes two types of memory chips: DRAM and Nand. DRAM chips act as the main memory in PCs, servers and other devices, working closely with central processing units. Nand flash chips provide longer-term data storage.</p>
          <h3>Outside Dow Jones: These Stocks Test Entries</h3>
          <p>With the stock market currently in a correction, now is the time to be adding to one's watchlist rather than buying stocks. Any buys now carry added risk.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, IT outsourcing play CGI (GIB) briefly cleared a flat-base entry of 94.10. It has since fallen back below this level. Overall performance is strong here, with the stock holding an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of 99.</p>
          <p>Packaged-food play Sovos Brands (SOVO) saw its relative strength line hit new heights as it tested a 16.93 buy point in a saucer base. It closed below that level. This is a first-stage pattern. Early-stage bases are more likely to succeed.</p>

          <h3>Economic Highlights</h3>
          <p>Fed Vice-Chair Michael Barr addressed the House Financial Services Committee on the SVB bank failure in prepared comments, noting "the bank waited too long to address its problems, and ironically, the overdue actions it finally took to strengthen its balance sheet sparked the uninsured depositor run that led to the bank's failure," he said.</p>
          <p>A full report on the bank collapse is scheduled for May.</p>
          <p>March consumer confidence posted a surprise uptick to 104.2 vs. the 101.0 consensus. The rise comes after three consecutive monthly declines, showing a positive reversal. The American consumer remains surprisingly resilient.</p>

          <p>Monday's Big Picture column commented, "The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue with a rally attempt that started about two weeks ago.

          <p><strong>Backstory:</strong>The company makes clear teeth-straightening systems called Invisalign. UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo says investors recently regained confidence in Align stock, which has surged 50% this year. December-ended quarter results from Align and its competitors, management commentary, U.S. economic data and a recent uptick in demand for Invisalign cases support this view, he said in a note to clients.</p>
          <p>Backstory: Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over macroeconomic concerns, recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.</p>
          <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Palo Alto Networks continues to trade above and below its 192.94 buy point out of a cup with handle amid Monday's 0.5% move higher. The buy area will run up to 202.59 if the stock retakes the entry. PANW stock was unchanged premarket Tuesday.</p>

          <p>On Tuesday, weekly China EV insurance registration data could be an important gauge for Tesla demand in the world's largest EV market, which is in the midst of a huge price war started by Tesla.</p>
          <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
          <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares declined 1.2% Monday, ending a two-day win streak. Shares remain near their recent highs. AAPL stock moved down 0.4% Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Microsoft shares are again trying to capture a flat base's 276.86 buy point, but closed back below the entry during Monday's 1.5% loss. The stock is just below the 5% buy area that goes up to 290.70. And shares fell 0.2% early Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Microsoft shares surged earlier this month after the company announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications. That follows the company's investments in AI startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzy ChatGPT application.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market? You should consider the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/25/2000.</p>
          <p>The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $15.23 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.</p>
          <h3>Why Large Cap Growth</h3>
          <p>Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.</p>
          <p>Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.</p>
          <h3>Costs</h3>
          <p>Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.</p>
          <p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.</p>
          <p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.09%.</p>
          <h3>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h3>
          <p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p>
          <p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 44.70% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.</p>
          <p>Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 14.01% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).</p>
          <p>The top 10 holdings account for about 49% of total assets under management.</p>
          <h3>Performance and Risk</h3>
          <p>SPYG seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization growth sector in the U.S. equity market.</p>
          <p>The ETF has gained about 6.29% so far this year and is down about -17.89% in the last one year (as of 03/28/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $49.14 and $68.01.</p>
          <p>The ETF has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 23.93% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 244 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p>
          <h3>Alternatives</h3>
          <p>SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SPYG is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.</p>
          <p>The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $78.01 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $168.40 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.</p>
          <h3>Bottom-Line</h3>
          <p>Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>(Bloomberg) -- In the battle for the biggest prize in China’s trillion-dollar pension market, BlackRock Inc. and other global firms have little chance of attracting clients like Judy Deng.</p>
          <p>On New Year’s Eve, the logistics executive tapped on her phone to deposit 12,000 yuan ($1,700) into a new pension account at her local bank in Shanghai. Deng, 46, never considered investing with global asset managers.</p>
          <p>“You need a very strong reason to pick a foreign company,” she said, calling the global giants “very unfamiliar” names. “I don’t even know which country they’re from.”</p>
          <p>China launched private pension plans for the first time last year and Beijing has ensured that domestic banks and fund managers win the vast majority of the new business in a market that may eventually grow to $1.7 trillion. Global companies including BlackRock and Fidelity International Ltd have been off to a slow start.</p>
          <p>Given their tiny asset bases in China, most foreign money managers have so far been excluded from pilot trials in 36 cities, allowing banks like Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Merchants Bank Co. to grab all the inflows. To cement their lead, the banks are offering everything from cash incentives to free ibuprofen for each new account.</p>
          <p>“The first bite at the cake here won’t be easy” for foreign companies, said Zhou Yiqin, president of GuanShao Information Consulting Center, a financial regulations specialist.</p>
          <p>While it’s still early days for the new pension scheme, the head start for domestic companies illustrates the daunting challenges for global firms eyeing a piece of China’s $60 trillion financial services sector. From mergers advice to stock sales and trading, Wall Street is struggling in a market that combines endless potential with stiff local competition and regulatory roadblocks.</p>
          <p>China’s fledging private pension system is loaded with promise, as Beijing desperately tries to entice retirement savings to support an aging population. The number of people over 60 is expected to jump more than 50% by 2040, according to the World Health Organization. China’s population shrank last year for the first time in six decades.</p>
          <p>To address the problem, China has launched three pension pillars. The first two — a compulsory state-backed plan and a voluntary corporate matching option — don’t come close to meeting the future needs of most pensioners. Savings in the government-led program covering urban employees may run out by 2032 and face a shortfall of more than 7 trillion yuan by 2035, according to Citic Securities Co. estimates.</p>
          <p>The new private offering aims to fill the void, allowing clients to contribute up to 12,000 yuan a year in tax-sheltered plans, similar to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) in the US that have become a $13 trillion market. The private pillar is estimated by Citic to grow to 12 trillion yuan by 2035, equal to the two other plans combined. UBS Group AG estimates the market could be worth $25 trillion by 2060, more than a third of China’s gross domestic product by then.</p>
          <p>Competition among the 23 pilot banks that can open these accounts — all Chinese — is heating up. Some managers are dangling 50 yuan in digital envelopes — or hongbao — to win customers. Others offered ibuprofen, the Advil-brand fever medicine that was in short supply during the pandemic, while Postal Savings Bank of China Co. runs draws with a 600 yuan top prize.</p>

          <p>Deng is among 28 million residents — more than the population of Australia — who have opened new accounts as of March 2. The program attracted 14.2 billion yuan in the last two months of 2022 alone, according to official data.</p>
          <p>The new plan is an attractive niche for asset managers since the tax breaks appeal to high-income earners and the money will be locked up for years with the same firm. Once a client opens a pension account with a bank, they can only invest in eligible funds distributed by that lender. That’s a rare, government-sponsored opportunity in China, where fickle investors are notorious for switching investments and banks.</p>
          <p>“The quality of this cake is much better than that of the regular type,” said Sun Bo, head of pension investment at Beijing-based China Asset Management Co., controlled by Citic Securities.</p>
          <p>So far, most international firms’ wholly-owned businesses have been unable to join the pension party. They either lack sufficient assets to meet thresholds set by Beijing, or they’ve only recently won regulatory approval — often after lengthy delays — to buy out local partners to sell their own funds.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Moves</p>
          <p>BlackRock, with about 6 billion yuan in mutual fund assets, still hasn’t issued any products under the new program even though its wealth management joint venture was allowed to join given its experience with a previous trial. The New York-based giant attracted just 158 million yuan in the earlier push with partners China Construction Bank Corp. and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte.</p>
          <p>“If a ‘Big Brother’ like BlackRock can’t adapt well in China, it would serve as a mirror for other global managers to gauge their own prospects” for pension funds, Zhou said.</p>
          <p>BlackRock didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p>

          <p>Other money managers such as Fidelity and Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which gained approvals for stand-alone units last year, are just starting to build onshore assets to meet the minimum thresholds.</p>
          <p>Fidelity is scheduled to start its first product early next month, while Neuberger Berman just raised 4.1 billion yuan in its maiden fund.</p>
          <p>JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have been in China for decades but only won approval in recent months to buy out their partners and ramp up their independent operation. JPMorgan has two funds in the trial via its joint venture.</p>
          <p>“The pension market is one of the biggest opportunities for our onshore business, considering China’s demographic change and tremendous need for retirement investments,” JPMorgan said in a statement to Bloomberg.</p>
          <p>Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</p>
          <p>For the new entrants, meeting the thresholds may take time. Only retirement-target products with at least 50 million yuan in average assets over the past four quarters — or at least 200 million yuan in the recent quarter — can qualify. To start selling retirement-target funds, the firms need to be in operation for at least two years, and run a mutual fund business of at least 20 billion yuan.</p>
          <p>These thresholds may be relaxed over time to entice more foreign players, UBS analyst Cao Haifeng told reporters in Shanghai.</p>
          <p>“If they get to participate in the domestic market, with investors warming up to their products, that should help facilitate China’s capital market development,” Cao said. “It’s going to be a win-win.”</p>
          <p>In the meantime, firms such as Credit Suisse Group AG and Schroders Plc are getting some pension revenue from their minority stakes in joint ventures though that’s not as lucrative as wholly-owned businesses like BlackRock’s that can pitch their own funds.</p>
          <p>Read more: China Moves a Step Closer to a National Pension System</p>
          <p>Winning over Chinese consumers won’t be easy as local banks tend to favor their in-house funds over rival products, Zhou said. Deng chose her lender — Bank of Shanghai — because a relative who works there needed to fill his quota. She even won a 50 yuan prize.</p>
          <p>Invesco Ltd.’s fund venture shut down one of its retirement-target funds after its assets dropped below a minimum 200 million yuan threshold following losses last year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s first wealth management product — not in the pension space — raised just $21 million, a fraction of the industry average.</p>
          <p>Global firms “must move faster” if they want a bigger share of the market, said Sun at ChinaAMC. While foreign players are often better at product design and asset allocation, they lack brand recognition and need to understand the bank-dominated distribution network, he said.</p>
          <p>The slow rollout could test global managers’ commitment to China as they face years of losses before building up scale, and it’s unlikely any foreign commercial bank will be selected for the trial, according to Zhou at GuanShao. He cited Citigroup Inc., which announced in December it will wind down its consumer bank in China as part of a wider retreat. Vanguard Group Inc. scrapped plans in 2021 to set up a wholly-owned fund business and now plans to exit the country entirely, people familiar told Bloomberg News.</p>

          <p>Still, global players have plenty of time to catch up in a market that will take years to develop, said Harry Handley, a senior associate at Z-Ben Advisors Ltd., an asset management research firm in Shanghai.</p>
          <p>“It was highly unlikely that foreign firms would be welcomed into the market from the very beginning and few are in a position to execute on the opportunity,” he said.</p>
          <p>Even with the slow start, Wall Street firms appear committed to the pension space in the world’s second-largest economy. Fidelity says pensions are “in their DNA” and are an integral part of their China focus.</p>
          <p>“In due course, leveraging Fidelity’s extensive experiences in managing pension investments for clients around the world, we aim to offer pension solutions to Chinese investors to enhance their retirement readiness,” the company said in an emailed statement.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>(Bloomberg) — On the surface, Charles Schwab Corp. being swept up in the worst US banking crisis since 2008 makes little sense.</p>
          <p>The firm, a half-century mainstay in the brokerage industry, isn’t overexposed to crypto like Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, nor to startups and venture capital, which felled Silicon Valley Bank. Fewer than 20% of Schwab’s depositors exceed the FDIC’s $250,000 insurance cap, compared with about 90% at SVB. And with 34 million accounts, a phalanx of financial advisers and more than $7 trillion of assets across all of its businesses, it towers over regional institutions.</p>
          <p>Yet the questions around Schwab won’t go away.</p>
          <p>Rather, as the crisis drags on, investors are starting to unearth risks that have been hiding in plain sight. Unrealized losses on the Westlake, Texas-based firm’s balance sheet, loaded with long-dated bonds, ballooned to more than $29 billion last year. At the same time, higher interest rates are encouraging customers to move their cash out of certain accounts that underpin Schwab’s business and bolster its bottom line.</p>
          <p>It’s another indication that the Federal Reserve’s rapid policy tightening caught the financial world flat-footed after decades of declining rates. Schwab shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since March 8, with some Wall Street analysts expecting earnings to suffer.</p>
          <p>“In hindsight, they arguably could have had more prudent investment choices,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Wong.</p>
          <p>Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger and the brokerage’s founder and namesake, billionaire Charles Schwab, have said the firm is healthy and prepared to withstand the broader turmoil.</p>
          <p>The business is “misunderstood,” and it’s “misleading” to focus on paper losses, which the company may never have to incur, they said last week in a statement.</p>
          <p>“There would be a sufficient amount of liquidity right there to cover if 100% of our bank’s deposits ran off,” Bettinger told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday, adding that the firm could borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank and issue certificates of deposit to address any funding shortfall.</p>
          <p>Through a representative, Bettinger declined to comment for this story. A Schwab spokesperson declined to comment beyond the Thursday statement.</p>
          <p>The broader crisis showed signs of easing on Monday, after First Citizens BancShares Inc. agreed to buy SVB, buoying shares of financial firms including Schwab, which was up 3.1% at 2:29 p.m. in New York. The stock is still down 42% from its peak in February 2022, a month before the Fed started raising interest rates.</p>
          <p>Unusual Operation</p>
          <p>Schwab is unusual among peers. It operates one of the largest US banks, grafted on to the biggest publicly traded brokerage. Both divisions are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations.</p>
          <p>Like SVB, Schwab gobbled up longer-dated bonds at low yields in 2020 and 2021. That meant paper losses mounted in a short period as the Fed began boosting rates to stamp out inflation.</p>
          <p>Three years ago, Schwab’s main bank had no unrealized losses on long-term debt that it planned to hold until maturity. By last March, the firm had more than $5 billion of such paper losses — a figure that climbed to more than $13 billion at year-end.</p>
          <p>It shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities from “available-for-sale” to “held-to-maturity” on its balance sheet last year, a move that effectively shields those unrealized losses from impacting stockholder equity.</p>
          <p>“They basically saw higher interest rates coming,” Stephen Ryan, an accounting professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said in a phone interview. “They didn’t know how long they would last or how big they would be, but they protected the equity by making the transfer.”</p>
          <p>The rules governing such balance sheet moves are stringent. It means Schwab plans to hold more than $150 billion worth of debt to maturity with a weighted-average yield of 1.74%. The lion’s share of the securities — $114 billion at the end of 2022 — won’t mature for more than a decade.</p>
          <p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield now: 3.5%.</p>
          <p>Cash Business</p>
          <p>Schwab’s other headache from higher interest rates stems from cash.</p>
          <p>At the root of Schwab’s income is idle client money. The firm “sweeps” cash deposits from brokerage accounts to its bank, where it can reinvest in higher-yielding products. The difference between what Schwab earns and what it pays out in interest to customers is its net interest income, among the most important metrics for a bank.</p>
          <p>Net interest income accounted for 51% of Schwab’s total net revenue last year.</p>
          <p>“Schwab’s counting on inertia,” said Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic, a financial-planning firm.</p>
          <p>After a year of rapidly rising rates, there’s greater incentive to avoid being stagnant with cash. While many money-market funds are paying more than 4% interest, Schwab’s sweep accounts offer just 0.45%.</p>
          <p>Though it’s an open question just how much money customers could move away from its sweep vehicles, Schwab’s management acknowledged this behavior picked up last year.</p>
          <p>“As a result of rapidly increasing short-term interest rates in 2022, the company saw an increase in the pace at which clients moved certain cash balances” into higher-yielding alternatives, Schwab said in its annual report. “As these outflows have continued, they have outpaced excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and pay-downs on our investment portfolios.”</p>
          <p>In their statement, Bettinger and Schwab wrote that “client deposits may move, but they are not leaving the firm.”</p>
          <p>FHLB Borrowing</p>
          <p>To plug the gap, the brokerage’s banking units borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report filed with regulators.</p>
          <p>Schwab borrowed an additional $13 billion from the FHLB so far this year, the filing showed.</p>
          <p>Analysts have been weighing these factors, with Barclays Plc and Morningstar lowering their price targets for Schwab shares in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>Bettinger and Schwab said that the firm’s long history and conservatism will help customers navigate the current cycle, as they have for more than 50 years.</p>
          <p>“We remain confident in our client-centric approach, the performance of our business, and the long-term stability of our company,” they wrote in last week’s statement. “We are different than other banks.”</p>

            <li>US stocks ended higher Friday, capping off a week of Fed moves and more bank fears.</li>
            <li>The 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields both notched their lowest levels in six months.</li>

          <p>US stocks ended higher on Friday as investors rallied to end the day in the green, throwing off new banking fears out of Europe.</p>
          <p>All three major indexes ended the day higher, capping off another tumultuous week for markets.</p>
          <p>Deutsche Bank stock plunge and unsettled financial markets early in the day. The slide came as bets on the German lender defaulting on its debts soared, with the price of credit default swaps linked to its bonds posting their largest-ever single-day jump.</p>
          <p>Yields on key Treasury bonds were down. The 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields tumbled to six-month lows as investors wager the Federal Reserve' interest rate hikes could soon be over, and the central bank could cut rates as the economy slows.</p>
          <p>"Confidence is fragile, market volatility is likely to stay high, and policymakers may have to go further to make sure faith in the global financial system stays solid," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management. said in a note on Friday.</p>
          <p>Haefele added: "Financial conditions are also likely to tighten, which increases the risk of a hard landing for the economy, even if central banks ease off on interest-rate hikes."</p>

          <p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Indian stock market may outperform its Asian and emerging market peers in the long term as lofty valuations ease and investors look to bet on the economy's growth prospects, brokerage group Jefferies said in a note.</p>
          <p>The benchmark Nifty 50 Index's price-to-earnings premium to China's Hang Seng Index declined to 115% from 208% in end October, and is in line with the 10-year average of 118%, Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy, Jefferies, wrote in his "Greed & Fear" report.</p>
          <p>India's long-term prospects have led the global brokerage to invest 39% of its Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio in the south Asian country compared with 25% in China.</p>
          <p>While foreign investors have sold $2.8 billion on a net basis in Indian markets so far this year, domestic equity mutual fund inflows have remained positive, Wood said.</p>
          <p>Domestic equity mutual fund inflows in the first two months of 2023 amounted to 282.33 billion rupees ($3.43 billion), according to official data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.</p>
          <p>The usual challenge of relatively high valuations remain, Wood said, adding that the brokerage will remain slightly "overweight" on India in the Asia Pacific ex-Japan relative-return portfolio.</p>
          <p>"The domestic demand story certainly remains intact to justify the continuing belief in the equity market. Loan growth has slowed somewhat but still remains solid ... The recovery in the residential property market also continues," Wood wrote.</p>
          <p>Asian banking systems remain remarkably free from stresses, Wood said, citing a slide in the ratio of non-performing loans in Indian banks to an eight-year low.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>(Reuters) -Credit Suisse Group AG said on Thursday it intended to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank in what it called "decisive action" to boost its liquidity.</p>
          <p>The planned move came after Swiss regulators pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse in an unprecedented move by a central bank after the flagship Swiss lender's shares fell by as much as 30% on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>"Credit Suisse is taking decisive action to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity by intending to exercise its option to borrow from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) up to CHF 50 billion under a Covered Loan Facility as well as a short-term liquidity facility, which are fully collateralized by high quality assets," Credit Suisse said in a statement.</p>
          <p>It pointed to its end-2022 Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.1% and average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 144%. The latter had improved to about 150% by March 14, it said.</p>
          <p>Referring to the intended borrowing, it said: "This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs."</p>
          <p>The collapses in the U.S. of Silicon Valley Bank last week and Signature Bank two days later have sent global bank stocks on a rollercoaster ride.</p>
          <p>Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank, said investors might be worried about Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse for different reasons, but both suffered from the side effect of high-interest rates.</p>
          <p>"The underlying economic stress may emerge more frequently ... and it is possible to see more black swans in an uncertain environment," he said.</p>
          <p>The Swiss lender's latest move came after CEO Ulrich Koerner said in an interview earlier on Wednesday that the bank's "capital, our liquidity basis is very very strong."</p>
          <p>"We fulfill and overshoot basically all regulatory requirements."</p>
          <p>Credit Suisse Group last month reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis after rattled clients pulled billions of dollars from the bank. It warned that a further "substantial" loss would come this year.</p>
          <p>The bank, Switzerland's second biggest, has begun a major overhaul of its business, cutting costs and jobs to revive its fortunes, including creating a separate business for its investment bank under the CS First Boston brand. The bank raised 4 billion Swiss francs from investors in December.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday, it also announced offers for senior debt securities for cash of up to 3 billion francs.</p>
          <p>The bank said it had also accelerated cost cuts and was well on track to deliver 2.5 billion francs of cost-base reductions by 2025, including 1.2 billion francs in 2023.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics said on Wednesday it expects to invest 300 trillion won (US$230 billion) over the next 20 years as part of an ambitious South Korean national project to build the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing base near the capital, Seoul.</p>
          <p>The chip-making "mega cluster", which will be established in Gyeonggi province by 2042, will be anchored by five new semiconductor plants built by Samsung. It will aim to attract 150 other companies producing materials and components or designing hi-tech chips, according to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.</p>
          <p>Samsung's new plants will be located near its existing domestic factories and will produce both memory chips used for storing data and higher-margin logic chips designed to perform a broader range of functions, the company said.</p>

          <p>A giant in the global memory chip business, Samsung is trying to expand its presence in advanced semiconductors, anticipating that demand will soar in coming years with the adoption of new technologies, such as 5G wireless networks, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.</p>
          <p>The semiconductor cluster is part of broader government plans announced on Wednesday to promote six key technology industries the country sees as most crucial for its export-dependent economy.</p>
          <p>Apart from semiconductors, they include rechargeable batteries, electric vehicles, robotics, displays and biotechnology. The government hopes to draw 550 trillion won in corporate investment on those projects through 2026.</p>
          <p>South Korea's plan comes as other technology powerhouses, including the United States, Japan and China, are building up their domestic chip manufacturing, deploying protectionist measures, tax cuts and sizeable subsidies to lure investments.</p>
          <p>In a meeting with economic policymakers and business leaders on Wednesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol described technology industries as the country's "key economic growth engines and security and strategic assets that are also directly linked to job creation and livelihoods".</p>

          <p>"(South Korea) has world-class manufacturing capabilities and technologies in various hi-tech industries such as semiconductors, secondary batteries, and displays, but (government) support and regulatory conditions have been insufficient", the Trade Ministry said in a statement.</p>
          <p>Samsung, South Korea's biggest company, has seen its profit plummet in recent months as a weak global economy, rattled by Russia's war on Ukraine and high inflation, depressed demand for its consumer electronics products and memory chips.</p>
          <p>The company's profit for the three months through December fell near 70 per cent, partially because chip prices fell sharply as clients adjusted their inventories to reflect economic uncertainties.</p>
          <p>SK Hynix, another major South Korean chip maker, reported an operating loss of 1.7 trillion won for the October-December period, which marked its first quarterly deficit since 2012.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms Inc. META 7.25%increase; green up pointing triangle said it would cut roughly 10,000 jobs over the coming months, the Facebook parent’s META 7.25%increase; green up pointing triangle second wave of mass layoffs in what it says is an effort to be more efficient in a difficult economy.</p>
          <p>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an email to staff on Tuesday that the company would in the coming months conduct multiple rounds of job cuts, as well as cancel some projects and reduce hiring rates as part of what he has dubbed the “year of efficiency.”</p>
          <p>Company recruitment teams will be cut first, followed by restructuring and layoffs in its technology groups in late April, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Business teams will face layoffs in May, he added. The company will also stop hiring for about 5,000 open positions.</p>
          <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said his company must cope with a longer term change in the economy, marked by the end of low interest rates, growing geopolitical tensions and costly new regulations.</p>
          <p>“At this point, I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “Given this outlook, we’ll need to operate more efficiently than our previous headcount reduction to ensure success.”</p>
          <p>Meta said in a securities filing Tuesday that it expects to lower its annual expenses by roughly $3 billion from an estimated range it gave on Feb. 1. It now expects to spend a total of $86 billion to $92 billion this year, including the costs of its layoffs and restructuring, which it said could total $3 billion to $5 billion.</p>
          <p>Meta’s share price rose more than 7% in Tuesday trading to just above $194, far outpacing the broader market. The stock is up more than 60% so far this year, though well below its all-time high of more than $380 in September 2021.</p>
          <p>Tuesday’s announcements come after Meta’s layoff of about 11,000 employees—or roughly 13% of its workforce—last fall, in the first broad head-count reductions in the company’s history. The new round of cuts is likely to add up to roughly the same magnitude as those layoffs, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p>
          <p>The new rounds of layoffs are likely to hit non-engineering roles especially hard, and among projects that will be cut are some wearable devices that were in the works at Reality Labs, Meta’s hardware and metaverse division, the Journal reported.</p>
          <p>While saying that layoffs were difficult, Mr. Zuckerberg in his email on Tuesday also described what he said were the advantages of a leaner organization, expanding on a new view of management for the current economy that he has been laying out in recent months.</p>
          <p>He said that many managers will “become individual contributors.” He also said that managers might now have up to 10 direct reports, rather than just a handful because the company now doesn’t expect to increase its head count as quickly as in the past.</p>
          <p>“It’s well-understood that every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “Every manager typically reviews work and polishes off some rough edges before sending it further up the chain.” He said the company will be “focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority” because those can take broader resources and managers’ attention from core priorities.</p>
          <p>“In retrospect, I underestimated the indirect costs of lower priority projects,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.</p>
          <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said the company analyzed performance data and found that engineers who joined the company in person before working remotely or remained in person performed better on average than those who joined the company remotely. The analysis also showed that engineers perform better on average when they work in person with teammates at least three days a week, he said. The company’s hypothesis is that in-person work helps build trust and is more effective, he said.</p>
          <p>He encouraged employees to find more time to work with colleagues in person. “We’re focusing on understanding this further and finding ways to make sure people build the necessary connections to work effectively,” he said Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Meta reported a head count of 86,482 employees at the end of December, up 20% from a year earlier, but said that figure still included most of the 11,000 employees affected by the November layoffs.</p>
          <p>Meta’s new layoffs add to waves of job cuts that have roiled Silicon Valley, where tech giants are now retrenching after adding employees by the tens of thousands through the pandemic. Technology companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have cut thousands of jobs in recent months.</p>
          <p>Since 2022, layoff tallies at tech companies have reached nearly 300,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that is tracking job cuts in the industry. Broadly, employment in the information industry was unchanged between July and January, according to federal data. Total employment rose in that time.</p>
          <p>Meta said Tuesday that it plans to extend a hiring freeze and pause internal transfers in the company while the layoffs and restructuring occur. Those freezes will lift in each unit once the restructuring there is complete.</p>
          <p>U.S. employees affected by the layoffs will get 16 weeks of severance pay, plus an additional two weeks for every year they worked at Meta, the company said. Outside the U.S., packages will vary depending on local laws.</p>

          <p>(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, according to a source familiar with the matter, as scrutiny mounts over the firm's sudden collapse and regulators scramble to contain the fallout.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is probing the sudden demise of the bank, which was shuttered on Friday following a bank run, the source said, declining to be named as the inquiry is not public. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a parallel investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probes.</p>
          <p>Spokespeople for the SEC, SVB and the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>
          <p>The investigation is in early stages and may not result in allegations of wrongdoing or charges being filed, the source said. Officials are also examining stock sales by officers of SVB Financial Group, which owned the bank, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
          <p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Sunday said in a statement the agency is particularly focused on monitoring for market stability and identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors during periods of volatility.</p>
          <p>The rapid demise of Silicon Valley Bank and the fall of Signature Bank have left regulators racing to contain risks to the rest of the sector. On Tuesday, ratings agency Moody's cut its outlook on the U.S. banking system to "negative" from "stable."</p>
          <p>SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued this week by shareholders, who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit susceptible to a bank run.</p>

          <p>US stocks rallied Tuesday as traders digested the latest inflation data, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track to snap a five-day slump.</p>
          <p>The consumer price index increased 0.4% in February from January, putting the annual rate at 6%. Both were in line with estimates and signaled continued cooling in inflation as the Federal Reserve weighs its next step on interest rates.</p>
          <p>Regional bank stocks staged a comeback after getting demolished on Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank contagion concerns on Monday. Shares of First Republic, PacWest, and Western Alliance were up double-digit percentage points.</p>
          <p>The collapse of both banks has fueled speculation the Fed will take a less hawkish stance. Goldman Sachs predicted the central bank will pause interest rate hikes at next week's FOMC meeting, citing "considerable uncertainty."</p>
          <p>"In light of recent stress in the banking system, we no longer expect the FOMC to deliver a rate hike at its March 22 meeting with considerable uncertainty about the path beyond March," analysts wrote in a Sunday note.</p>

          <p>US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced Monday that it had reached a deal to buy biotech firm Seagen, specializing in innovative cancer treatment, for $43 billion.</p>
          <p>Pfizer is offering $229 per share in cash, and the companies expect to complete the transaction later this year or in early 2024, they said in a statement.</p>
          <p>"Pfizer is deploying its financial resources to advance the battle against cancer," said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.</p>
          <p>"Oncology continues to be the largest growth driver in global medicine, and this acquisition will enhance Pfizer's position in this important space," Bourla added.</p>
          <p>Seagen -- leading in the research, development and commercialization of cancer treatments -- is growing, with a 12 percent increase in revenue forecast this year to $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p> Targeting cancer -</p>
          <p>The company, headquartered in Washington state, came to major drugmakers' attention with its work on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are "designed to preferentially kill cancer cells."</p>
          <p>The agreement has been approved by the boards of both firms, and will be subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.</p>
          <p>A deal would have to pass heightened scrutiny from antitrust regulators.</p>
          <p>The Biden administration has also been seeking to keep down drug prices.</p>
          <p>Pfizer expects to finance the deal through $31 billion of new long-term debt and a "combination of short-term financing and existing cash."</p>
          <p>For now, Pfizer Oncology has a portfolio of 24 approved innovative cancer medicines that generated $12.1 billion in 2022, it said.</p>
          <p>The deal with Seagen would double Pfizer's early-stage oncology clinical pipeline, the pharmaceutical firm added.</p>
          <p>"The addition of Seagen's world-leading ADC technology will position us at the forefront of innovative cancer care," said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief development officer of oncology and rare disease.</p>
          <p>Seagen CEO David Epstein added that "the proposed combination with Pfizer is the right next step for Seagen to further its strategy."</p>
          <p>According to reports, Pfizer competitor Merck was in talks with Seagen previously but these did not go through.</p>
          <p>Pfizer expects that Seagen may contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030, "with potential significant growth beyond 2030," the company said.</p>
          <p>Seagen's portfolio includes three products with ADCs, including Padcev, which is used for the treatment of urothelial cancer.</p>
          <p>The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into combining Padcev with Merck's Keytruda in treating patients with advanced bladder cancer who are not eligible for chemotherapy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. bank crisis deepened Monday as the financial industry continued to reel from last week's closing of vital venture capital lender Silicon Valley Bank and its parent SVB Financial (SIVB) Friday — marking the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. On Sunday, regulators shuttered cryptocurrency-focused Signature Bank (SBNY) and moved the assets to a bridge bank while agencies search for a buyer. Investors continued to dump bank stocks early Monday.</p>
          <p><strong>Bank Stocks Reel</strong></p>
          <p>Financial stocks continued to fall Monday as investors felt for the limits of the bank crisis triggered on Friday. Trading for First Republic was halted early Monday after FRC stock fell nearly 68% after the open to 26.45 after sliding roughly 15% on Friday. WAL stock trading was temporarily paused as shares of Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) toppled 80% Monday morning after shedding 20.88% Friday. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) was briefly halted as the stock plummeted nearly 52% Monday after collapsing 37.9% before the weekend. Zions Bancorp (ZION) retreated 34% Monday.</p>
          <p>First Horizon (FHN) trading halted early Monday as FHN stock fell 23% in the morning. And Regions Financial (RF) trading was paused after sliding nearly 6% Monday.</p>
          <p>Charles Schwab (SCHW) slid more than 16% Monday morning after losing 11.7% Friday. Bank of America (BAC) weakened about 4.3% in early trading after inching lower Friday.</p>
          <p>JPM stock pared early losses to less than 0.5% Monday. It climbed 2.5% Friday, one of the day's few banking bright spots.</p>
          <p><strong>Bank Crisis: Signature Bank Closed</strong></p>
          <p>On Sunday, state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank and appointed the FDIC as the receiver. Signature Bank is the 20th largest bank in the U.S. and roughly 30% of its deposits came from crypto customers.</p>
          <p>The FDIC transferred all deposits and "substantially" all of the assets to Signature Bridge Bank. The bridge bank is a full-service bank operated by the agency as it markets the institution to potential bidders.</p>
          <p>As of Dec. 31, Signature Bank had $110.4 billion in total assets and $82.6 billion in deposits. Signature Bank operations and banking activities will resume Monday, March 13. Regulators guarantee that, "all depositors of the institution will be made whole. No losses will be borne by the taxpayers." In a joint press release Sunday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg approved systemic risk exceptions for Signature Bank to soothe fears of a bank crisis.</p>
          <p>"Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system," the regulators wrote in the release. "This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth."</p>
          <p><strong>A Special Assessment On Banks</strong></p>
          <p>Regulators approved similar systemic risk exceptions for Silicon Valley Bank. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. In addition, officials removed senior management, according to the announcement. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law. And Sunday, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will make additional funding available to eligible institutions to assure banks have the ability to meet all their depositors' needs.</p>
          <p>"The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry," regulators wrote. "Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe."</p>
          <p><strong>First Republic Shores Up Funds</strong></p>
          <p>On Sunday, First Republic Bank (FRC) secured additional liquidity from the Federal Reserve Bank and JPMorgan (JPM) to shore up its operations. The additional borrowing capacity brings the total available, unused liquidity to fund operations to more than $70 billion, the company announced in a press release.</p>
          <p>"First Republic's capital and liquidity positions are very strong, and its capital remains well above the regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks," CEO Jim Herbert said in the announcement.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile on Monday, Bank of America removed its rating price target on First Republic, from its previous Buy rating and $90 price target. The unexpected bank failures resulted in First Republic "no longer trading on fundamentals," and made the previous targets unreliable, Bank of America wrote in a research note.</p>
          <p><strong>PacWest Operations Update</strong></p>
          <p>On Friday, following the Silicon Valley Bank failure, PacWest Bancorp released an operations update on its current liquidity. PacWest listed $41 billion in assets and $33.2 billion in deposits as of March 9. The Los Angeles-based bank lists $28.3 billion in loan balances, $1.9 billion in cash on hand, $5.3 billion in liquid securities and about $2 billion available from the Federal Reserve Discount Window.</p>
          <p>"Though the banking industry is experiencing significant volatility in light of recent events, we want to reiterate that Pacific Western Bank is a well-performing, well-diversified, full-service commercial bank with more than 20 years of history," CEO Paul Taylor said in the release. "We have been a proven partner to our customers through all economic cycles and are actively adapting in the current economic environment."</p>
          <p>Following the update, DA Davidson analyst Gary Tenner upgraded PacWest to Buy from Neutral on Monday, but lowered the price target to 29 from 31. The bank's financial update was largely in-line with the firm's Q1 expectations, despite contagion concerns, Tenner wrote in a research note.</p>

          <p>On the economic front, eyes will be on the consumer price index on Tuesday. The CPI is expected to rise 0.4%, both overall and excluding food and energy. That would bring the headline CPI inflation rate down to 6% from 6.1% in January, with the core inflation rate easing to 5.5% from 5.6%.</p>
          <p>Earnings continue trickling out at the tail end of the season this week. Among them are Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO), Adobe (ADBE), Dollar General (DG), FedEx (FDX), Five Below (FIVE), GitLab (GTLB) and Lennar (LEN).</p>
          <p><strong>Stock Market Today</strong></p>
          <p>Drug giant Pfizer (PFE) agreed to pay $43 billion for biotech Seagen (SGEN). Pfizer shares rose 0.3%, while SGEN stock soared 15%.</p>
          <p>Genetic screening tools leader Illumina (ILMN) jumped more than 11% early, on news reports that activist investor Carl Icahn planned to nominate three persons to the company's board of directors.</p>
          <p>Electric-vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) traded down more than 2% Monday morning after Wolfe Research downgraded the stock to peer perform from outperform. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were up after the stock market open.</p>
          <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and New Relic (NEWR) — as well as Dow Jones stock Salesforce (CRM) — are among the top stocks to watch in the new stock market correction.</p>
          <p>Palo Alto is an IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock. New Relic was recently an IBD Stock Of The Day. And Salesforce was featured in last week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
          <p><strong>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</strong></p>
          <p>After Monday's market open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, and the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite erased sharp losses in morning action, with Seagen and Illumina leading the index.</p>
          <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.1% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) dropped 0.2% early Monday.</p>
          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield tumbled to 3.69% Friday. Then on Monday, the 10-year yield dived to 3.47% in early morning trade, as safe haven trade drove bonds sharply higher following the SVB collapse. The dollar angled lower, losing ground against the euro and the yen.</p>
          <p>Oil prices sold off Monday morning after Friday's brief bounce. West Texas Intermediate futures slid nearly 5% in early trade, trading below $73 a barrel early Monday. Gold and silver also moved sharply higher as investors sought solid ground. Gold jumped 1.4% to above $1,892 an ounce. Silver rallied 3.3%, clearing $21 an ounce.</p>
          <p><strong>Stock Market Correction</strong></p>
          <p>On Friday, the stock market sold off sharply, as the major stock index ended with big losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.45%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.8%.</p>
          <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "IBD changed its market outlook to 'uptrend under pressure' Thursday. And after Friday's selloff we've cut our outlook further, to 'market in correction.'

          <p><strong>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Salesforce</strong></p>
          <p>In recent weeks, Dow Jones leader Salesforce showed big upside strength after strong fourth-quarter results. But those gains have mostly disappeared amid the recent market weakness, and now the stock is back below a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry. Still, the stock's recent strength is a reason to monitor the software leader in the coming sessions. CRM stock rose 0.5% Monday.</p>
          <p><strong>Top Stocks To Watch: Palo Alto, New Relic</strong></p>
          <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Palo Alto Networks continues to trade quietly in a handle after the stock's 12.5% surge on Feb. 22. Shares remain within striking distance of a base's 192.94 buy point. Bullishly, the stock's relative strength line is at new highs, as the stock sharply outperforms the market averages. PANW stock traded down 0.8% Monday morning.</p>
          <p>Backstory: On Feb. 21, the cybersecurity giant announced good results for the January-ended quarter that saw earnings hit $1.05 a share, up 81% vs. a year earlier, on a 26% jump in revenue to $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Recent IBD Stock Of The Day, New Relic, is working on a flat base with a 80.98 buy point in the aftermath of the Feb. 8 earnings-fueled surge. The RS line is holding up for now. NEWR stock was down 1.6% Monday.</p>
          <p>Backstory: New Relic provides a cloud-based suite of software products that enables organizations to collect, store and analyze massive amounts of data in real time. Customers gain increased visibility into their enterprise software to help make data-driven decisions.</p>
          <p><strong>Tesla Stock</strong></p>
          <p>Tesla stock snapped a four-day losing streak Friday, with modest gains. It's trying to find support around its key 50-day line and closed Friday around 55% off their 52-week high.</p>
          <p>Tesla shares fell 2% Monday morning, threatening to erase Friday's gains.</p>
          <p><strong>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</strong></p>

          <p>As we laid out in last Friday's AAP Weekly Roundup, over the weekend a plan was hatched to stem the impact from SVB Financial (SIVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) via a joint statement released Sunday night by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. This included the Fed sharing it "will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors."</p>
          <p>Our view is this action is a Band-Aid approach to reassure depositors in order to prevent a repeat of what we saw late last week, but the fallout to come likely will see banks becoming more disciplined with their loan programs. This could pressure early-stage companies that are contending with the tech downturn, but it could also jump-start merger-and-acquisition activity in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Given the speed with which this unfolded and the impact that Silicon Valley Bank had on the market -- with its $212 billion in total assets, $74 billion in total loans and $342 billion in total client funds as more than 2,500 venture capital firms banked with it and 15% of its loans were secured by residential mortgages and commercial real estate -- odds are there will be ripple effects. And there will still be questions over similar exposures at banks and other institutions tied to the venture debt market. That is going to raise questions about bank profitability, and indeed we are seeing some of those questions emerge today.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing the market question the Fed's next steps when it comes to monetary policy and its fight against inflation. Following the weekend's developments, the CME FedWatch Tool tells us the odds of a 50-basis-point move by the Fed next week is off the table, but we are still likely to see a 25-basis-point move. Without any fresh inflation data since Friday's February Employment Report, it's fair to say the market is thinking the Fed will factor the happenings of the last few days into its thinking.</p>
          <p>We are seeing a mixed outlook in equity futures this morning, with those for Nasdaq moving higher while the ones for the Dow Industrials and S&P 500 are bouncing back and forth between slightly up and modestly down. The yield for the 10-Year Treasury is also moving lower, hitting 3.515%, pretty much back to where it was in early February. What is climbing this morning, is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which is up double-digits to levels we haven't seen since late. October. This move along with the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index that fell sharply to Extreme Fear from Neutral over the last week suggests the next few days are likely to be volatile and potentially emotional for some investors.</p>
          <p>The next few days bring not only the February Consumer Price Index report as well as Wednesday's February Producer Price Index report but also the February Retail Sales report. If tomorrow's CPI data is more in line with the Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model that calls for headline CPI to come in at 6.2% in February with the core reading up 5.5%, showing little progress against January's respective readings of 6.4% and 5.6%, we could see the market react negatively as it once again rethinks what the Fed is likely to do next week. The key to is remember the Fed's dual mandate - stable prices and maximum employment. </p>
          <p>What this all means is the market will continue to trade day to day based on what is learned that day. Only once we get through the coming days will we have more answers that will tell us what is likely to happen. For now, we will sit on the sidelines, letting our cash, inverse ETFs and the position in gold via the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) fulfill their role in the portfolio. As we noted in Friday's Roundup, there are several holdings that have been hit, putting them back at more than interesting price levels. However, given a potential for the market to whipsaw in the coming days, we will bide our time for at least a bit longer.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, we would note that this Friday we have a triple witching event with the expiration of stock options, stock index futures and stock index options. This happens roughly four times a year and has been known to produce strong swings in the market. As we move toward that and digest the week's data we will also be closely watching the technical levels for the S&P 500 we shared earlier this morning. </p>

          <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell $2 in volatile trading on Monday as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank hit equities markets and raised fears of a fresh financial crisis, but a recovery in Chinese demand provided support.</p>
          <p>Brent crude futures were down $2.03, or 2.5%, to $80.75 per barrel by 1401 GMT. West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell $2.11, or 2.8%, to $74.57 a barrel.</p>
          <p>Brent earlier in the session hit lows last seen in early January while WTI touched prices last reached in early December.</p>
          <p>Fears of contagion from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to a sell-off in U.S. assets at the end of last week, while state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank on Sunday.</p>
          <p>Europe's STOXX bank index was down 5.8%, having shed 3.8% on Friday. U.S. authorities launched emergency measures on Sunday to shore up confidence in the banking system.</p>
          <p>"Investor sentiment towards these sectors will be hit in the near term. The crisis indicates that there continues to be sizeable risks in financial markets", said Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners.</p>
          <p>"Interest rates have moved a long way in a short space of time, exposing weaknesses across the global financial system."</p>
          <p>Market sentiment was already fragile as worries about further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve have been exacerbated by high U.S. crude oil inventories.</p>
          <p>In recent days a weaker dollar, which makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies, has lent some support to prices.</p>
          <p>Oil's fall follows positive momentum on Friday, when U.S. employment data surprised to the upside. Data for February beat expectations, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 311,000, compared with expectations of a gain of 205,000 in a Reuters survey.</p>
          <p>From a medium- to long-term supply perspective, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co on Friday said U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a fourth week in a row for the first time since July 2020.</p>

          <p>(Bloomberg) -- China’s efforts to ramp up lithium extraction could see it accounting for nearly a third of the world’s supply by the middle of the decade, according to UBS AG.</p>
          <p>The bank expects Chinese-controlled mines, including projects in Africa, to raise output to 705,000 tons by 2025, from 194,000 tons in 2022. That would lift China’s share of the mineral critical to electric-vehicle batteries to 32% of global supply, from 24% last year, according to a note on Friday.</p>
          <p>The race to secure lithium is playing out at the highest levels, with nations including the US prioritizing access to the materials necessary for making batteries as the world turns away from fossil fuels. China’s needs are particularly acute because it’s home to the world’s biggest market for new energy vehicles.</p>
          <p>The rise in Chinese output will include an increase in material derived from lepidolite, a lithium-bearing rock often overlooked as poor quality and environmentally unsound because of its low yield and high energy costs. UBS sees lepidolite in China accounting for 280,000 tons of lithium in 2025, or 13% of global supply, from 88,000 tons last year, as the government continues to support the sector.</p>
          <p>Beijing has already moved to curb unlicensed lepidolite extraction in Jiangxi province, a major mining hub, as it seeks to exert more control over its deposits.</p>

          <p>US stocks sank Friday, with a losing week capped by the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis and the prospect of higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 was on the verge of losing its 2023 gain as it finished closer to 3,839.50, where it ended after last year's 19% plunge. The index's financial sector was the worst performing on Friday as regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank to prevent a run on the tech-startups lender. The bank collapsed after this week saying higher interest rates spurred billions in losses on a $21 billion bond portfolio.</p>
          <p>"Silicon Valley Bank was heavily reliant on the tech industry, catering mainly to startups and the investors that fund them. However, the insular ecosystem of startups and investors that it served took a hit when the Fed began raising rates to curb inflation," Thomas Smale, CEO of FEI International, wrote Friday.</p>
          <p><strong>Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Friday: </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>S&P 500: 3,861.72, down 1.44%</li>
            <li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: 31,909.83, down 1.07% (345.03 points)</li>
            <li>Nasdaq Composite: 11,138.89, down 1.76%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Stocks had moved higher ahead of the opening bell after investors found some relief in the February jobs report.</p>
          <p>The Labor Department said the US economy added 311,000 jobs last month, much higher than expectations of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. But wage growth slowed to 0.2% from January's 0.5% pace, curbing expectations the Federal Reserve will upsize its March interest rate hike to 50 basis points.</p>

          <p>(Bloomberg) -- Government-bond yields fell the most since since 2008 after a US bank failure spurred traders to reassess the outlook for additional Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
          <p>Shorter-dated Treasury yields plummeted for a second day as traders reverted to pricing in a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s March 21-22 meeting, instead of a half-point move. The market also resumed pricing in a quarter-point cut by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The moves occurred even as US employment data released Friday showed job creation exceeded estimates for an 11th straight month in February, which prompted economists at Barclays Plc to forecast a half-point hike in March. The mixed data, which also showed wages rose less than expected, was overshadowed by the failure of SVB Financial Group, which buckled under the strain of declining deposits and losses on its securities portfolio.</p>
          <p>The two-year Treasury yield fell nearly 30 basis points to 4.57% at one point and ended near its session low. The yield’s two-day slide of just under 50 basis points was the biggest since 2008. Investors also piled into German short-term debt, sending those rates into a similarly steep decline.</p>
          <p>“It is incredible to see the whipsaw action in Treasury yields and it’s likely people want to own Treasuries into the weekend,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed-income strategy at Wisdom Tree Investments.</p>
          <p>Traders reasoned that the prospect of contagion in the banking system could curb the Fed’s willingness to keep raising rates despite still-elevated inflation. Swaps referencing the March meeting price in about 32 basis points of tightening, down some 13 basis points from earlier in the week. A rate cut by year end from the expected peak level had dwindled to less than a coin-toss in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>“The reaction in the market reflects the broader worry about US banks and investors did expect a beat in the payrolls number,” said Andrzej Skiba, portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Markets are jittery about potential fallout from the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, which has suffered losses on a portfolio including US Treasuries. Investors are turning their attention to risks that may lurk in other financial institutions — and questioning the degree to which the Fed’s rate hikes have precipitated that pain.</p>
          <p>US payrolls in February rose by more than expected while a broad measure of monthly wage growth slowed, offering a mixed picture as the Fed contemplates whether to step up the pace of rate hikes. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6% as the labor force grew, and monthly wages rose at the slowest pace in a year. Nonfarm payrolls increased 311,000 after a 504,000 advance in January, revised down from 517,000.</p>
          <p>Traders will look to whether next week’s release of US consumer inflation data warrants pricing in a quarter- or half-point hike this month.</p>
          <p>“The market is clearly reading that the labor report is solid but not strong enough for the Fed to re-accelerate the hiking cycle,” said Roberto Cobo Garcia, BBVA’s head of G10 FX strategy. “It would probably take very significant surprises in the CPI data next week for the Fed to change course again.”</p>

          <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell slightly early Friday, while Nasdaq futures were little changed ahead of the February jobs report. SVB Financial kept plunging overnight after triggering a bank stock sell-off that slammed the broad market Thursday. Treasury yields kept falling.</p>
          <p>Oracle (ORCL) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reported earnings late.</p>
          <p>The stock market rally reversed sharply lower Thursday as questions about banks' financials suddenly came to the fore. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell to critical support levels.</p>
          <p>Bank stocks plunged as SVB Financial (SIVB), parent of Silicon Valley Bank, cratered on a series of negative headlines while long-ailing crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) said it would shut down. Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) were among the high-profile losers.</p>
          <p>SIVB stock continued to plunge late as fears of a bank run grew.</p>
          <p>Investors should be cautious, waiting for the market rally to show renewed strength.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Earnings</strong></p>
          <p>ORCL stock fell 5% overnight after Oracle earnings topped but revenue fell short. Oracle stock skidded 5.9% to 81.75 on Thursday, falling below its 50-day line. Shares have been working on a 91.32 buy point from a deep cup-with-handle base.</p>
          <p>ULTA stock edged lower in premarket action. Ulta Beauty earnings and revenue topped views, but same-store guidance was light. The beauty products retail giant dipped 0.8% to 519.93 on Thursday, just below its 21-day line. ULTA stock does not have a clear buy point.</p>
          <p><strong></strong></p>
          <p>Jobs Report</p>
          <p>The Labor Department will release the February jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect to see nonfarm payrolls up by 223,000, a big slowdown from January's 517,000, but that would still be a strong two-month start to the year. The jobless rate should hold at a 53-year low of 3.4%. Average hourly earnings should climb 0.3%, but the annual pay gain should pick up to 4.7%.</p>
          <p>On Thursday, Labor reported initial jobless claims rose more than expected to their highest number since December. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that announced layoff plans are the highest to start a year since 2009.</p>
          <p>The February jobs report, along with next week's CPI inflation report, could lock in expectations for half-point rate hike on March 22.</p>
          <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
          <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.4% vs. fair value, but off overnight lows. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.</p>
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield sank 11 basis points to 3.83%. The 2-year yield slumped 11 basis points to 4.79%.</p>
          <p>Crude oil futures fell 1%.</p>
          <p>The February jobs report will be sure to swing Dow Jones futures, Treasury yields and Fed rate hike expectations.</p>
          <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
          <p><strong>Stock Market Rally</strong></p>
          <p>The stock market rally got off to a decent start Thursday on rising jobless claims, but soon reversed lower on bank concerns. The major indexes steadily worsened, closing near session lows.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index tumbled 1.85%, with SIVB stock, First Republic Bank (FRC) and Schwab the biggest losers. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.05%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has a lot of financial components, plunged 2.8%.</p>
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.2% to $75.72 a barrel.</p>
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 3.92%. The two-year Treasury yield plunged 16 basis points to 4.9%, while the six-month T-bill yield dipped 3 basis points to 5.28%.</p>
          <p>Fed rate hike expectations have shifted, but not decisively.</p>
          <p>As of early Friday, Markets see a 62% chance of a 50-basis-point move on March 22, down from Thursday's 68.3% and Wednesday's 78.6%. The odds spiked from around 30% before Fed chief Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony on Tuesday. Markets are now pricing in 75 basis points of rate hikes over the next three Fed meetings, with another quarter-point increase likely over that time.</p>
          <p><strong>Bank Stocks</strong></p>
          <p>SIVB stock plummeted 60% to 106.04, the lowest price since 2016. SVB Financial late Wednesday announced a $1.75 billion share sale. The Silicon Valley Bank parent also cut guidance. Deposits are dwindling due to startups facing a funding drought. There are also big concerns about SVB's loans to the tech industry.</p>
          <p>SIVB stock plunged over 60% in heavy premarket trade Friday. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is advising companies to pull money from Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported. SVB Financial still has to price that share offering.</p>
          <p>Silvergate Capital, which has been in free-fall for months, announced late Wednesday that it would shut down, with its Silvergate Bank liquidating. SI stock dived 42% on Thursday.</p>
          <p>The SVB and Silvergate news slammed financials, already under pressure as the extremely inverted yield curve upends the traditional borrow short/lend long lending strategy.</p>
          <p>KeyCorp (KEY), which warned on net interest margins earlier in the week, slumped 7.2% Thursday. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) tumbled nearly 13%, and FRC stock dived 16.5%.</p>
          <p>JPM stock skidded 5.4%. On Tuesday, JPMorgan fell below a 138.76 buy point and its 50-day line. BAC stock retreated 6.2% to its lowest levels since October. WFC stock also lost 6.2%, tumbling below its 200-day line after breaking below its 50-day earlier in the week.</p>
          <p>SCHW stock plunged 12.8%, gapping below the 200-day line and the low of its base. JPMorgan offered a block sale of 8.5 million Schwab shares, Bloomberg reported. SCHW stock is at its worst levels since October.</p>
          <p>On Friday, banking giants were little changed or edged lower after big losses Thursday and for the week. But FRC stock sold off again, with Western Alliance and KeyCorp also down</p>
          <p>Investors will take a much-closer look at banks' balance sheets and capital levels, something that hasn't been a real concern up until now. Banks are pushing up deposit and CD rates significantly, while long-term rates lag. Many banks are sitting on sizable unrealized losses on loans and other securities.</p>
          <p>If banks rein in lending, that could rapidly chill the economy. Meanwhile, SVB Financial and Silvergate Capital's woes raise concerns about their tech and crypto clienteles.</p>
          <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
          <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) tumbled 3.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slumped 2.3%, with ORCL stock a big IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gave up 1.9%.</p>
          <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 4.2% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 3.8%.</p>
          <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) shed 2.6% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) 2.2%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 3.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 1.6%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) retreated 1.4% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) 1%.</p>
          <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) plunged 4.1%, with JPM stock, Wells Fargo, Charles Schwab and Bank of America all notable holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dived 8.2% to a three-year low. SIVB stock is a notable KRE holding, along with KeyCorp and Western Alliance.</p>
          <p><strong>Market Rally Analysis</strong></p>
          <p>The stock market rally had a highly negative day, with a downside reversal damaging the major indexes and leading stocks.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 opened by rising above its 50-day line, but soon hit resistance at the 21-day moving average and reversed lower to below its 200-day line and its March 2 low.</p>
          <p>The Nasdaq initially rose above its 21-day line, but then reversed to below the 200-day line. The tech-heavy composite briefly undercut its 50-day before settling just above that level.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones knifed below its 200-day line to a four-month low.</p>
          <p>The Russell 2000 fell decisively below its 50-day line, all the way to its 200-day line.</p>
          <p>Some leaders held up, but most did not.</p>
          <p>Banking concerns triggered by SIVB stock, Silvergate and KeyCorp don't mean a financial crisis is on the way. Banks, especially the giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, are far-better capitalized than they were in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. But the fact that the words "financial crisis" are even being mentioned is a big shift.</p>
          <p>If banks rein in lending aggressively, that would hit the broader economy quickly. That also would raise the already-hefty risk that the Federal Reserve will overshoot rate hikes, triggering a hard landing. That also could spur the Fed to be more cautious with rate hikes.</p>
          <p>Friday's jobs report will be important, but it's the market reaction that matters. Keep in mind that if the economy suddenly stalls, lagging employment data won't offer a warning.</p>
          <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
          <p>With the S&P 500 and other major indexes heading south once again, it's not a time to add exposure. Investors should be looking to cut losses on recent buys that are struggling.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the market rally will once again find support with a tame jobs report or upcoming inflation data, but hope isn't a strategy. The key indexes are on the cusp of breaking decisively lower.</p>
          <p>On the upside, wait for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to retake their 21-day lines. If that happens, new buying opportunities will emerge. So keep working on those watchlists.</p>

          <p>Silvergate served the cryptocurrency industry, while SVB was the bank for Silicon Valley tech startups.</p>
          <p>It's a black week for the American financial system: In just 48 hours, the banking sector has been shaken by the collapse of two major banks.</p>
          <p>Most worrying is that these banks served two so-called growth economic sectors: the tech sector and the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
          <p>SVB Financial Group,  (SIVB) - Get Free Report the lender to Silicon Valley startups, failed on March 10, falling into the hands of the FDIC. The federal agency has taken control of the banking company, reviving the ghosts of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
          <p>"Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver," the federal agency said in a news release.</p>
          <p>"All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week. Uninsured depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds."</p>
          <p>It added that it may pay a dividend to uninsured depositors as it sells the assets of SVB</p>
          <p>The FDIC is a guarantor for bank depositors.</p>
          <p><strong>SVB: The To-Go Bank for Tech Startups</strong></p>
          <p>At the end of last year SVB had $209 billion in total assets and $175 billion in total deposits. SVB becomes the second biggest failure of a U.S. bank after Washington Mutual in 2008.</p>
          <p>SVB was a central player in the innovation economy. It was the backbone of the tech industry in Silicon Valley. It played an important role in the startup ecosystem by providing specialized financial services, industry expertise, a valuable network, and a strong reputation.</p>
          <p>It also offered a range of financial services tailored specifically to the needs of startups, such as venture debt, corporate banking, and asset management. These services are designed to help startups manage their finances, optimize their cash flow, and scale their businesses.</p>
          <p>SVB suffered from the rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve because it hurt the value of its investment assets, especially bonds. As a result, the bank had to resort to a capital raise as many startups withdrew their deposits from the bank since they were burning a lot of cash.</p>
          <p>SVB had to sell bonds, primarily U.S. Treasury securities, at a discount to cover these withdrawals. The rise in interest rates has made existing bonds less valuable. In selling these bond positions, SVB had to take a significant loss.</p>
          <p>But its attempt to raise $2.25 billion failed.</p>
          <p><strong>Crypto Bank Silvergate Collapsed</strong></p>
          <p>Two days earlier, Silvergate, the crypto bank, collapsed. The bank was where most of the big crypto firms went, because traditional banks did not want to do business with them. And that reluctance stemmed from warnings from regulators who consider the crypto industry a risky sector.</p>
          <p>The company said on March 8 that it intended "to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate the bank in an orderly manner and in accordance with applicable regulatory processes."</p>
          <p>It added: "In light of recent industry and regulatory developments, Silvergate believes that an orderly wind down of bank operations and a voluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward."</p>
          <p>"The bank’s wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits. The Company is also considering how best to resolve claims and preserve the residual value of its assets, including its proprietary technology and tax assets."</p>
          <p><strong>Verging on Bigger Fall Than 2008: Economist Schiff</strong></p>
          <p>The rout of the La Jolla, Calif., bank was due to pressure from regulators, in particular the Department of Justice, which has opened an investigation into its business relations with the empire of the former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
          <p>Bankman-Fried has been charged with 12 counts of fraud, stemming from the collapse of his crypto empire, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research.</p>
          <p>Silvergate was established in 1988. The bank initially specialized in lending to industrial customers and at the time also offered loans for both residential and commercial real estate.</p>
          <p>But in 2013, the bank began to court crypto firms, when traditional banks were reluctant to do so due to the opacity prevailing in the sector. Silvergate thus became the crypto bank. </p>
          <p>In 2019, the firm made its initial public offering, promising a complete refocus on the industry, which was then experiencing a renaissance. As of Sept. 30, Silvergate had $11.9 billion in digital assets held as deposits. </p>
          <p>But the bankruptcy of FTX and Alameda on Nov. 11 scared away customers. The bank thus reported only $3.8 billion in digital assets held as deposits as of Dec. 31. FTX was one of Silvergate's big customers.</p>
          <p>The question now is whether other U.S. banks will fall? Could SVB and Silvergate's issues spread to other regional banks especially since suspicion can lead customers to rush to these banks to withdraw their money?</p>
          <p>"The U.S. banking system is on the verge of a much bigger collapse than 2008," said economist Peter Schiff, known for his dire predictions. </p>
          <p>"Banks own long-term paper at extremely low interest rates. They can't compete with short-term Treasuries. Mass withdrawals from depositors seeking higher yields will result in a wave of bank failures."</p>

          <p>TAIPEI (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc.'s Google said on Wednesday it will launch a T$300 million ($9.8 million) fund over the next three years to help boost the Taiwanese media's continuing operations and digital competitiveness.</p>
          <p>Google has come under pressure in some countries to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, though not in Taiwan.Google said it will pay local publishers through what it calls a "Taiwan News Digital Co-prosperity Fund" to strengthen their digital publishing capability.</p>
          <p>The fund will help Taiwan local media "hone digital skills, gain expertise and support the sustainable development of Taiwan's news industry", the company said. "Even while Google faces many challenges in the overall international environment, Taiwan remains a crucial global stronghold," Tina Lin, managing director of sales and operations at Google Taiwan, told reporters in Taipei. Google said Taiwan's media industry has been facing major competitive challenges in adapting to the digital age, pointing out that advertising revenues for traditional media outlets have dropped 70% from 2003 to 2020. The initiative marks the latest effort by the internet giant to develop mechanisms to support and compensate regional news providers whose content appears on Google, as it faces the prospect that governments may impose regulations to require such mechanisms.</p>
          <p>An Australian law giving the government power to compel Google and rival Meta Platforms to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets has largely worked, according to an Australian government report in late 2022.</p>

          <p>Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?</p>
          <p><strong>Why Does Debt Bring Risk?</strong></p>
          <p>Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.</p>
          <p><strong>What Is Amazon.com's Net Debt?</strong></p>
          <p>The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2022 Amazon.com had debt of US$85.1b, up from US$57.7b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$70.0b, its net debt is less, at about US$15.1b.</p>
          <p><strong>How Strong Is Amazon.com's Balance Sheet?</strong></p>
          <p>The latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$155.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.2b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$70.0b in cash and US$42.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$204.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.</p>
          <p>While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amazon.com has a huge market capitalization of US$958.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.</p>
          <p>We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.</p>
          <p>With net debt sitting at just 0.28 times EBITDA, Amazon.com is arguably pretty conservatively geared. And it boasts interest cover of 8.9 times, which is more than adequate. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Amazon.com if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 51% cut to EBIT over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.</p>
          <p>Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amazon.com recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.</p>
          <p><strong>Our View</strong></p>
          <p>While Amazon.com's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow makes us cautious about it, its track record of (not) growing its EBIT is no better. But at least its net debt to EBITDA is a gleaming silver lining to those clouds. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think Amazon.com's debt poses some risks to the business. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. While Amazon.com didn't make a statutory profit in the last year, its positive EBIT suggests that profitability might not be far away.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.</p>

        content: <div className="blog-content">
          <p>Meta's rival to ChatGPT has been leaked online and is now available for download. Yahoo Finance investigates how much it differs from Microsoft and Google's AI alternatives.</p>
          <p>In February, Meta (META) unveiled LLaMA, their memorably-named Large Language Model competitor to Microsoft's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.</p>
          <p>At the time Mark Zuckerberg's tech-firm stated that they would only give researchers access to the artificial intelligence application, so as to "maintain integrity and prevent misuse".</p>
          <p>Meta's initial release statement said: "To maintain integrity and prevent misuse, we are releasing our model under a noncommercial license focused on research use cases, and access to the model will be granted on a case-by-case basis to academic researchers."</p>
          <p>However, someone has now leaked Facebook/Meta's Large Language Model alternative to the public via fringe online messaging platform 4Chan.</p>
          <p>After the leak, developers have taken the new chat-bot app out for a test drive, so what do we know so far?</p>
          <p>So far Meta's offering in the AI gold-rush to create the ultimate 'automated companion' for our journeys throughout cyber-space is similar in style to ChatGPT and Bard, with an ability to generate human-like responses to prompts and questions.</p>
          <p>According to popular AI newsletter The Neuron, "early testers are saying that LLaMA isn't as good as the models powering ChatGPT.</p>
          <p>"That's mostly because ChatGPT has anchored people to chat, and LLaMA wasn't taught how."</p>
          <p>On machine learning platform Hugging Face, one developer inquired, "anyone know how to get going with LLaMA?"</p>
          <p>Another platform released the code for LLaMA, on the popular website Github. Where developers had quickly used Meta's code to introduce 'ChatLLaMA', which was described as having a training process that was 15 times faster than ChatGPT.</p>
          <p>After the leak was detected Meta sent a takedown notice to Hugging Face, citing legal issues.</p>
          <p>Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun has also claimed that although LLaMA is a smaller AI model that uses less parameters than rivals it will be just as powerful, if not more, than other leading language models.</p>
          <p>Rivals ChatGPT and Google's Bard are trained following the scaling law, which attests that the more parameters the model has access to, the better the result.</p>
          <p>However, a paper released last month by Meta artificial intelligence researchers claimed that "although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of performance, a smaller one trained longer will ultimately be cheaper at inference".</p>
          <p>Within artificial intelligence technology, 'inference' explains how an AI model can use the data that it has been trained on to understand new information that it has never been exposed to before. In application, this gives the AI the ability to make decisions and evolve its understanding when fed fresh data.</p>
          <p>According to AI news outlet The De-Coder, Meta's alternative to ChatGPT "is more compact and faster and is even said to be on par with Google’s PaLM-E model".</p>
          <p>Google's PaLM-E combines language, speech and robotics, but has not yet been released.</p>
          <p><strong></strong></p>
          <p>What are Large Language Models?</p>
          <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured mass media headlines across the globe since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November, which has received investment from Microsoft (MSFT) to the tune of $10bn (£8.3bn).</p>
          <p>ChatGPT now has over 100 million users, the fastest application to mass adoption on record, and Microsoft has stated that the new technology will operate as a user's 'co-pilot' as they navigate the web.</p>
          <p>Large Language Models allow 'artificial intelligence' to generate content on request via a trawl of large data sets, in a matter of seconds.</p>
          <p>These generative-AI tools can produce haiku, jokes, corporate emails, business plans, fix computer code, write academic essays and even pieces of original fiction in the style of any writer you want, from Joyce and Dostoyevsky, to Shakespeare.</p>
          <p>Microsoft and Google (GOOG) are competing to build the best models to boost their search engines.</p>

          <p>In this article, we will discuss the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks. If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks.</p>
          <p>There has been a global energy crisis since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. European countries realized they heavily relied on Russian natural gas and crude oil and needed to transition away from these sources to reduce their dependence. During the conflict, the price of crude oil and natural gas spiked significantly due to global uncertainty, and the importance of oil and gas supply took center stage in the political landscape. As a result, there has been an acceleration in the installation of renewable energy resources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the capacity growth of renewable energy is set to double in the next five years. During this process, renewable energy sources will overtake coal and become the biggest energy source for the generation of electricity.</p>
          <p>The IEA anticipates the capacity of renewable energy to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) during the 2022 to 2027 period. The increase in the capacity growth of renewable energy is 30% higher than the forecast one year ago. This reflects the positive intent of governments around the world on transforming towards renewable energy sources. The IEA also notes that 90% of the increase in electricity capacity globally will be done through renewable sources, and as a result, renewable energy will become the biggest source of electricity generation by early 2025. IEA Director Fatih Birol shared that in the next five years, the world will add as much renewable energy as in the last two decades.</p>
          <p>Besides Europe, India, China, and the US are also aggressively pursuing the rollout of renewable energy at various levels. The 14th Five-Year Plan rolled out by China in January 2022 focuses on making China a behemoth in the field of renewable energy, as the country will be responsible for nearly 50% of new capacity additions through renewable energy during the 2022 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 in the US intends to provide long-term support to the aggressive expansion and adoption of renewable energy by various corporations. Meanwhile, India is also set to increase its investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion between 2022 to 2027. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) are some of the most profitable renewable energy stocks in the industry currently.</p>
          <p>A thorough research was conducted on the renewable energy sector, including its current market trends, growth projections, and key players, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and identify the most promising companies within it. We then shortlisted the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks on the basis of their trailing 12 months’ net income.

          <h3>KEY POINTS</h3>
          <ul><li>Amazon ads are the most effective and cheapest way to advertise online, making their ads more attractive for brands versus competitors.</li></ul>
          <ul><li>The ad business is likely already its most profitable and valuable segment.</li></ul>
          <ul><li>The best thesis for investing in this stock as the economy normalizes over the next year or two is its prowess in digital advertising.</li></ul>
          <p><strong>This technology conglomerate is building a sizable profitable ad business capable of challenging Meta's family of apps and Google's advertising empire</strong></p>
          <p>It turns out that even mighty Amazon (AMZN 0.40%) is not immune to the adverse effects of inflation and rising interest rates. For example, its quarterly revenue growth rates for its North American and International e-commerce segments peaked in the first quarter of 2021. Even worse, both e-commerce businesses turned in an unprofitable fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
          <p>As for Amazon Web Services (AWS), revenue has consistently decelerated over the last several years amid intensifying competition and the law of large numbers, which states that the larger a company grows, the more difficult it is to achieve prior growth rates.</p>
          <p>For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2018, AWS grew revenue at 45% year over year, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, the cloud unit only produced 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Additionally, operating income for AWS dropped 2% year over year during the latest fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Since Amazon's primary growth engines offered investors little to be excited about since the first quarter of 2021, investors became fascinated with the growth potential of Amazon's nascent digital advertising business. However, since Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google ad business and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) family of app businesses, including Facebook, dominated the online advertising industry for about a decade, the question is whether Amazon's advertising business is worth investors' attention as a possible long-term growth engine.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look.</p>
          <p><storng>Its advertising unit is taking share</storng></p>
          <p>According to an article by Axios, which cited statistics from Insider Intelligence, Google and Meta combined in 2022 for a less than 50% market share for the first time in eight years. These statistics show that both companies are losing market share, and the prime cause is Amazon, which ended 2022 with a 7.3% digital ad market share. Still, analysts project its share to explode to nearly 13% by 2024, closing the gap with Meta's projected 17.9% share -- a drop from the 19.6% market share Meta achieved in 2022.</p>
          <p>Many advertisers are gravitating to Amazon ads since it's the most effective and cheapest way to advertise online.</p>
          <p>According to a Feedvisor report that cites a 2020 survey of over 1,000 brands, 36% of all brands say Amazon generates the highest return on media spend, followed by paid social at 29% and then Google at 27%. Even better, 59% of the brands on Amazon's e-commerce marketplace say that it drives the highest return on media spending, followed by Google at 22% and then paid social at 17%.</p>
          <p>As far as cost, according to a report from e-commerce analytics firm Sellics, Amazon ads are 68% cheaper than Google, 44% cheaper than Facebook, 79% cheaper than Instagram, and 13% cheaper than e-commerce competitor Walmart (NYSE: WMT).</p>
          <p><strong>Why investors are interested in its ad unit</strong></p>
          <p>While Alphabet's advertising unit and Meta's advertising lost approximately 4% year over year in revenue in the fourth quarter, Amazon's ad unit generated 19% year over year, despite an ad market that global media company Magna Global forecasts to slow further during 2023. And only the 20% revenue growth of the AWS segment was better for it in the fourth quarter. However, the prime rationale behind the investors' strong interest in the ad segment is that it is likely the most profitable piece of its business.</p>
          <p>While the company does not reveal the profitability of its ad business, analysts have roughly figured the profitability that Amazon gains in advertising by comparing it to Google and Meta's advertising units' profitability and using a few assumptions. Most analysts conclude that Amazon's advertising unit is more profitable than AWS.</p>
          <p>In addition, AWS also requires substantial capital investment, long-term investments in property, equipment, land, computers, and software needed to operate the cloud business. In its fourth-quarter 2021 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky revealed for the first time that just under 40% of its capital expenses go toward supporting AWS.</p>
          <p>Suppose that is true; in 2022, $25 billion of capital expenditures went into supporting AWS, while AWS only produced $22.84 billion in operating income in the same year. Amazon likely uses all of the AWS segment's operating income to pay the cloud unit's capital expenses. Thus AWS currently has a feeble free cash flow. And if you assume advertising is a less capital-intensive business, it produces better free cash flow than AWS.</p>
          <p>So however you want to parse it, advertising is a rapidly growing, profitable growth engine for Amazon that might already be its most valuable business.</p>
          <p><strong>A foggy short-term future</strong></p>
          <p>Amazon shareholders should understand that a recession would not benefit any of its businesses, including advertising, which relies substantially on the health of its e-commerce markets.</p>
          <p>Suppose you want to invest in Amazon stock for its long-term potential in advertising. Be aware that things could get much worse before getting better, and the ad business won't ride in to save the day.</p>
          <p>Still, as the economy normalizes over the next year or two, the ad business will likely become its most significant growth engine and a strong thesis for becoming a shareholder.</p>

          <h3>Key Points</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Alphabet has been beaten down, with shares trading 40% below their highs.</li>
            <li>The company has a dominant and profitable core business, as well as some big potential growth drivers.</li>
            <li>With massive financial flexibility and an attractive valuation, Alphabet is worth a closer look.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>This dominant industry leader still has lots of growth potential.</strong></p>
          <p>There's a solid argument to be made for most of the FAANG stocks right now. Just to name a couple examples, Amazon trades for less than half of its recent peak, and Netflix recently reported subscriber numbers that were dramatically better than analysts were expecting.</p>
          <p>However, as we head into spring, there is one FAANG stock that looks like a particularly strong long-term opportunity while interest rates and inflation remain elevated and economic uncertainty persists: Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.42%) (GOOG 0.51%). The company offers a rare combination of maturity, profitability, and growth potential, and with shares down by about 40% from their highs, it looks like a bargain for patient investors.</p>
          <p><strong>A core business with maturity and growth potential</strong></p>
          <p>Roughly 90% of Alphabet's revenue comes from Google Services, and to be fair, this is a collection of relatively mature, ad-driven businesses. The dominant Google Search platform is the biggest component, but this also includes YouTube, Gmail, Android, Chrome, Maps, and other popular consumer-facing platforms.</p>
          <p>There could still be significant growth potential on this side of the business, but it's not likely to happen in the years ahead. However, Google Services is a collection of rock-solid dominant businesses that produces a reliable stream of high-margin revenue.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Google Cloud, which currently accounts for about 10% of the company's revenue, could be a major growth driver in the years to come. It provides business collaboration tools, cloud storage, database services, content delivery networks (CDN), artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, app platforms, and much more. In all, Google Cloud offers more than 150 different products.</p>
          <p>For the time being, Google Cloud is a relatively small part of the business, but that could change in the coming years. For one thing, Cloud is the fastest-growing part of the company, with revenue increasing 32% year over year in the fourth quarter. It is the only one of the big three cloud providers to gain significant share of the cloud infrastructure market in recent quarters (Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure are the leaders).</p>
          <p>Not only that, but the cloud market itself is expanding rapidly. The cloud computing market was estimated at $484 billion in size in 2022, but is expected to more than triple by 2030 to a $1.55 trillion opportunity. If Google Cloud can increase its market share, this could end up being a big growth driver.</p>
          <p><strong>Lots of optionality</strong></p>
          <p>There are a few other reasons Alphabet is my favorite FAANG stock right now. The "other bets" segment doesn't produce much revenue currently, but that could potentially change in the future. The Waymo self-driving vehicle start-up is especially promising, but there are also some start-ups in healthcare and artificial intelligence, among other industries. To be clear, I'd buy Alphabet even if nothing ever came of these businesses -- but it's a nice addition to the tech titan's future potential. And it also doesn't limit the company's acquisition potential to just organizations that fit into the Google Services and Cloud segments.</p>
          <p>Finally, it's important to consider Alphabet's stellar financial condition. The company has about $140 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet, which gives it tremendous financial flexibility, especially when you consider it generated nearly $60 billion in net income over past four quarters alone. Alphabet can fund acquisition opportunities, reinvest in innovation, or opportunistically buy back shares as it sees fit.</p>
          <p><strong>Should you add Alphabet to your portfolio before the second half of 2023?</strong></p>
          <p>At some point, inflation will decline back toward historic levels and the Federal Reserve will back off of its interest rate increases, which could be an excellent catalyst for industries like advertising. More economic certainty would likely translate into more ad spending across the core Google Services businesses and would also make enterprise customers more comfortable increasing their spending on cloud services. So while I think Alphabet makes an excellent long-term investment regardless of timing, it could be an especially opportunistic buy while the stock is still about 40% below its highs due to the current economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>By Jonathan Stempel</p>
          <p>(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc has resumed its purchases of Occidental Petroleum Corp shares after a five-month hiatus, increasing its stake in the oil company to about 22.2%, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Berkshire paid about $355 million for 5.8 million Occidental shares between March 3 and March 7, according to the filing.</p>
          <p>The purchases were the first Berkshire has disclosed since late September. It ended last year with a 21.4% stake.</p>
          <p>In August, Berkshire won U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission to buy up to 50% of Occidental's common stock.</p>
          <p>Buffett's company now owns about 200.2 million Occidental shares worth $12.2 billion, based on Tuesday's closing price of $60.85.</p>
          <p>Those shares would generate about $144 million of annual dividends, following a 38% increase that Occidental announced last month.</p>
          <p>Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock that throws off $800 million of annual dividends, plus warrants to buy another $5 billion of common stock.</p>
          <p>Occidental ended January with about 900 million shares outstanding.</p>
          <p>Berkshire began buying large quantities of the Houston-based company's stock about one year ago.</p>
          <p>After its stake surpassed 20%, Berkshire adopted the equity method of accounting for its holdings, and now reports its share of Occidental's results with its own.</p>
          <p>Accounting rules normally require the equity method above the 20% threshold, reflecting an assumption that the holder might exert significant influence.</p>
          <p>Berkshire ended 2022 with $128.6 billion of cash and equivalents. It plans to keep a $30 billion cushion.</p>
          <p>Occidental's share price more than doubled in 2022, benefiting from higher oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
          <p>Though fourth-quarter profit was lower than analysts expected, Occidental said it planned to raise capital spending this year and could repurchase up to $3 billion of stock.</p>
          <p>Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, consumer brands such as Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom, and other stocks including Apple Inc.</p>

          <p>Alphabet (GOOGL) closed the most recent trading day at $93.86, moving -1.34% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 1.53% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.72%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 3.27%.</p>
          <p>Coming into today, shares of the internet search leader had lost 7.55% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.34%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.28%.</p>
          <p>Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Alphabet as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $1.09 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 11.38%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $56.89 billion, up 1.56% from the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.12 per share and revenue of $246.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.28% and +5.48%, respectively, from last year.</p>
          <p>Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.</p>
          <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
          <p>The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.61% lower. Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).</p>
          <p>Digging into valuation, Alphabet currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.58. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 25.2, which means Alphabet is trading at a discount to the group.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, GOOGL's PEG ratio is currently 1.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.36 as of yesterday's close.</p>

          <p>Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to grade how tech sector leaders performed this past earnings season amid labor trends, A.I. adoption, and TikTok facing legislative headwinds.</p>
          <p>SEANA SMITH: Meta planning another round of layoffs this week, that's according to reports from Bloomberg. Now, the move would add thousands more to the 11,000 workers that were cut from the social media giant last November. It is the latest in a tech industry that has certainly seen a massive contraction over the last several months.</p>
          <p>Here to break down how the major players are navigating this and who's coming out on top, Yahoo Finance's tech reporter Allie Garfinkle has that for us. Hey, Allie.</p>
          <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Seana. So while I'm not a teacher, I want to break this down report card style because these companies are all in incredibly different positions. I want to start with Apple, who is at the top of the pack with an A. Now, Apple's earnings were actually not standard Apple. We actually saw a rare miss out of them this last cycle.</p>
          <p>However, there's a key number that's really important here for how things are looking, and it's 2 billion devices. That is how big their install base is. I believe that's more than 20% of the world's population. So the iPhone install base is at an all-time high, and it's sending the company's services revenue to a record of $20.8 billion.</p>
          <p>What does this-- what does this all amount to? It says that analysts say that this bodes extremely well for Apple's future as they increase how much individual users spend. So not a standard quarter for Apple, but there is a lot of good news there. So we'll give them an A. Maybe we'll fudge it to an A-minus.</p>
          <p>Now, next is Microsoft. So Microsoft will get a B, slight top line B, slight bottom line miss, but they won the ChatGPT lottery. Now, while their cloud growth is slowing, it slowed to about 31%, just barely beating analysts' expectations, that $10 billion investment in ChatGPT came at exactly the right moment. So we're going to give them a B for foresight.</p>
          <p>Next, Amazon. Revenue beat, earned EPS miss. Amazon has a lot to prove here. They're really doubling down on cost cutting, and I'm giving them a C because of that cloud number. Amazon Web Services net sales came in missing. It was a $21.3 billion actual versus $21.76 billion expected.</p>
          <p>Now, that doesn't seem like a big miss. And to be fair, it is not. However, that has been a stalwart-- AWS has been a stalwart of Apple-- of Apple-- of Amazon's business for so long, that it is very important that they keep that growth up or come up with a new plan.</p>
          <p>And last, we have Meta, which is going to get a C. Yes, they beat key revenue expectations, and there are growing losses on the Reality Labs operation, hence the C. However, they are investing in a $40 billion stock buyback plan, and they're betting that this year of efficiency, this cost-cutting plan, is going to work. I'm withholding judgment for now, but they are certainly ready to bet on themselves.</p>
          <p>Of course, now Meta being in the news because they're reportedly set to do another round of layoffs that could affect thousands and could come as early as this week. That said, Meta is the only one we know is doing layoffs for the time being. However, given Jerome Powell's testimony earlier today that rates will continue rising, the macroeconomic climate that has been so difficult for so many of these companies will continue to be difficult, so we'll have to see how they navigate it moving forward.</p>
          <p>DAVID BRIGGS: Very good. So, Allie, you mentioned the ChatGPT lottery being won by Microsoft. Let's shift to the other one, which is the TikTok ban boost, if you will. Who stands to benefit the most? Because you're young and I'm old and because you're our tech reporter, is it YouTube Shorts, therefore Google? Is it Meta with their Reels? Or is it even Snap, who's seen a really solid pop to start the year? Who's the closest to emulating it in terms of social media style?</p>
          <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: That is a really good question, Dave, and I'll be candid. I think there are a couple of different answers, and we would have to have that whole scenario play out to really know who the winner is. That said, I'm going to actually throw my hat in on Snap here. Every analyst I've ever spoken to who's bullish on Snap has one key argument, and it's that it is essential for teenagers. And if that's like something TikTok has become known for, it's certainly something Snap is known for, definitely on Wall Street and, to be fair, among the teenagers I've talked to.</p>
          <p>So I'd say if there's anyone who's set to really benefit, I would put money on Snap. That said, YouTube Shorts is something Google has massively invested in. Meta has been preparing for the moment where, hopefully, TikTok is less of a competitor for a long time. I think we could see a massive shift in the competitive landscape. But I would say the biggest beneficiary could be Snap, and the market certainly seems to think so.</p>
          <p>DAVID BRIGGS: That's an interesting take because I sat at a Celtics game with a 15-year-old the other day, and he was on Snap the entire time, not TikTok.</p>
          <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: The kids love it.</p>
          <p>DAVID BRIGGS: So, yeah--</p>

          <p>The average rate for mortgage offers clicked on by Bankrate readers Thursday was 5.38 percent, up 15 basis points from the previous week. Mortgage rates remain higher than they were a year ago, so it remains important to shop around if you want to find a good deal for a new loan or a refinance.</p>
          <p>Bankrate’s “clicked-on” rate reflects both purchase mortgages and refinances with all terms, including 30-year and 15-year loans.</p>
          <p>The best deals come with some caveats. For instance, to reel in the best combination of interest rate and costs, you generally need a credit score of 740 or higher and a down payment of 20 percent or more. Many of the lowest rates posted on Bankrate.com also require borrowers to buy discount points, a way of lowering the loan’s interest by paying a fee at closing — known as “buying down” the rate.</p>
          <p>Rates for mortgages change constantly, and they’ve recently risen. Those ups and downs reflect the volatility of the mortgage market as the economy continues to grapple with slowing-but-still-significant inflation and a looming recession.</p>
          <p>While it still might make sense to refinance your mortgage, the rationale has changed: Most refis now are being done by homeowners pulling out equity to pay for home renovations or repairs.</p>
          <p>Key Takeway</p>
          <p>Be sure to get offers from at least three lenders — you can save thousands of dollars by comparison shopping.</p>
          <h3>Average clicked on rate for purchase loans</h3>
          <p>The average rate clicked on by Bankrate readers for 30-year purchase mortgages was 6.31 percent on Thursday.</p>
          <h3>Average clicked on rate for refinance loans</h3>
          <p>The typical rate clicked on by Bankrate readers for 30-year refinances stood at 6.23 percent Thursday.</p>
          <p>You can use Bankrate’s mortgage payment calculator to estimate your monthly payments and see the effect of making extra payments. The tool can also help you determine how much interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan.</p>

          <p>By Alexandra Alper</p>
          <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp's plans to sell technology to China's Huawei would be thwarted if the U.S. government proceeds with a proposal to further restrict shipments to the blacklisted company, a draft report by a government contractor shows.</p>
          <p>The Biden administration has been considering limiting the items it authorizes U.S. companies to ship to telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co, which was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 but which continues to receive billions in U.S. goods under a special plan implemented by the Trump administration.</p>
          <p>"The proposed 2023 amendment of (the Commerce Department's) licensing will likely have a high economic impact on Nvidia," according to excerpts of the draft report seen by Reuters, referring to the company's "pending license value."</p>
          <p>Nvidia's plans to sell to Huawei have not been previously reported.</p>
          <p>A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the document, saying: "The China market presents a significant opportunity for the U.S. semiconductor industry. While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”</p>
          <p>A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department "would not have approved of the report in its current form." It also said the government "has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions."</p>
          <p>The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
          <p>The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.</p>
          <p>Reuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.</p>
          <p>The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a "moderate economic impact" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei "relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering."</p>
          <p>Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
          <p>Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.</p>
          <p>Huawei was placed on the "entity list" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.</p>
          <p>The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level" to be shipped to Huawei was "under assessment."</p>
          <p>But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.</p>

          <p>(Bloomberg) -- With artificial intelligence booming, one key player in the fast-growing space is talking to investors about raising more money after just reaching unicorn status in a funding round late last year.</p>
          <p>The parent company of Stable Diffusion, an AI tool for making digital images, is seeking to raise money at a valuation of about $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because it isn’t public. It isn’t clear how much capital Stability AI Ltd. is seeking to raise in the potential round. A final decision hasn’t been made on whether to go ahead with the financing and the valuation could still change, the people added.</p>
          <p>London-based Stability, whose investors include Coatue Management and Lightspeed Venture Partners, last raised $101 million at a valuation of about $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported in October.</p>
          <p>Representatives for Stability AI didn’t provide a comment.</p>
          <p>That it’s going back to market so soon amid a tech downturn at a much richer valuation underscores how artificial intelligence in recent months has become the hottest topic in Silicon Valley, with the potential to upend entertainment, finance and even education.</p>
          <p>Microsoft Corp., Bloomberg News reported in January, is investing $10 billion in OpenAI, the parent of ChatGPT, a leader in the technology, with tools that can generate uncannily detailed pictures, text and other media with a short prompt. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said Friday that he was stepping down from the board of OpenAI, as his venture capital firm increasingly invests in other AI companies.</p>
          <p>Other tech giants including Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also competing to get out front in AI.</p>
          <p>Stable Diffusion competes with OpenAI’s Dall-E 2, another digital-image tool.</p>
          <p>The way Stable Diffusion works is that people type in a description of an image — say an astronaut riding a horse — and the program spits out a realistic or surrealistic picture. The company says it stands apart from competitors because its open-source software is available to the public. Its practical uses include designing video games to advertisements.</p>

          <p><strong>China E-Commerce Giant JD Set for $1.4 Billion Discount Spree</strong></p>
          <p>(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. will offer discounts across its online shopping platforms from Monday in a 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) campaign to capture new users ahead of an anticipated Chinese economic recovery this year.</p>
          <p>The campaign has spurred concerns that larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. or upstart PDD Holdings Inc. may retaliate with cuts of their own, igniting a margin-eroding price war. JD announced the launch of the subsidy plan in a statement on its official WeChat account Saturday.</p>
          <p>China’s internet firms are revving up efforts to outdo each other since Beijing began to wind back its bruising crackdown on the tech sector, spurring an abrupt surge in competition that’s spooking investors. Meituan is said to be expanding into Hong Kong and has embarked on a campaign to hire 10,000 people on the mainland — an effort to beat back heightened competition from new entrants such as ByteDance Ltd. in the $145 billion Chinese food-delivery arena.</p>
          <p>JD shares tumbled after news of the impending rivalry surfaced in domestic media last week. Alibaba executives have since dismissed speculation it would directly engage its longtime rival, warning that a return to the price wars of years past was in nobody’s best interest.</p>
          <p>In 2020, Beijing launched a crackdown campaign to rein in what it called the “reckless expansion of capital,” affecting sectors from e-commerce to online education and the sharing economy. The government has begun rolling back restrictions since late 2022, intent on reviving a Covid-struck economy.</p>

          <p>(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. partner Foxconn Technology Group plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in India to ramp up local production, people familiar with the matter said, underscoring an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.</p>
          <p>The Taiwanese company, also known for its flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., plans to build the plant to make iPhone parts on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public.</p>
          <p>The factory may also assemble Apple’s handsets, some of the people said, and Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business. Apple declined to comment.</p>
          <p>The investment is one of Foxconn’s biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China’s at risk of losing its status as the world’s largest producer of consumer electronics. Apple and other US brands are leaning on their Chinese-based suppliers to explore alternative locations such as India and Vietnam. It’s a rethink of the global supply chain that’s accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.</p>\
          <p>Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu, who met India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not comment on a possible Karnataka investment in a statement on Saturday outlining his visit.</p>
          <p>“My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships, meet old friends and make new ones, and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles,” Liu said. “Foxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders.”</p>
          <p>The new production site in India is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, the people said. The company’s sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs some 200,000 at the moment, although that number surges during peak production season.</p>
          <p>Output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain. Foxconn’s decision is the latest move that suggests suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected.</p>
          <p>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</p>
          <p>The plan may herald an accelerated relocation from China for Hon Hai. Once completed, we calculate this factory could materially improve the component supply in India and potentially boost the country’s share of iPhone assembly to 10-15 % from a sub-5% currently.</p>
          <p>— Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts</p>
          <p>Several government officials including India’s deputy tech minister tweeted confirmation of details around the upcoming plant on Friday, including that it will be built soon and create 100,000 jobs.</p>
          <p>The plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details, the people said. It’s also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities.</p>
          <p>The Karnataka state government also did not respond to a Bloomberg request for comment. Liu has committed to another manufacturing project in the neighboring Telangana state.</p>
          <p>Foxconn’s decision would be a coup for Modi’s government, which sees an opportunity to close India’s tech gap with China as Western investors and corporations sour on Beijing’s crackdowns on the private sector.</p>
          <p>India has offered financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which began making the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu last year. Smaller rivals Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. have also ramped up in India, while suppliers such as Jabil Inc. have begun making components for AirPods locally.</p>

          <p>(Reuters) - Twitter Inc reported a drop of about 40% year-over-year in both revenue and adjusted earnings for the month of December, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
          <p>The report comes after several advertisers slashed their spending on the social-media platform after Elon Musk took charge of the company on Oct. 27, resulting in a 71% drop in advertising spend on Twitter during December, data from advertising research firm—Standard Media Index showed.</p>
          <p>Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
          <p>Musk, who warned in November about the possibility of the Twitter going bankrupt, said in December that the company was on track to be "roughly cash flow break-even" in 2023.</p>
          <p>Twitter made its first interest payment in January on a loan that banks provided to help finance billionaire Musk's purchase of the social media company last year.</p>

          <p>(Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp said on Friday it made a "risk-based decision" to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network, its crypto payments network, two days after the digital asset-focused bank raised doubts about its viability.</p>
          <p>"Effective immediately Silvergate Bank has made a risk-based decision to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). All other deposit-related services remain operational," Silvergate said in a statement posted on its website.</p>
          <p>The Silvergate Exchange Network, one of the bank's most popular offerings, enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.</p>
          <p>Silvergate shares on Friday slumped more than 2% in after-hours trading, after closing up 0.9% at $5.77 in regular trade. The shares on Thursday had fallen to a record low, ending the day down more than 97% from their all-time high in November 2021.</p>
          <p>Silvergate on Wednesday warned in a filing that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern, disclosing that it had sold additional debt securities this year at a loss and that further losses mean the bank could be “less than well capitalized.”</p>
          <p>After the warning, cryptocurrency heavyweights including Coinbase Global Inc and Galaxy Digital dropped Silvergate as their banking partner. Stablecoin issuers Paxos and Circle, Cboe’s digital asset exchange, and crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Gemini also suspended their partnerships with Silvergate.</p>

          <p>Google is feeling the heat—from employees. With Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing making waves and Google’s answer to it, Bard, suffering a “demoralizing” demo last month, workers want to know the game plan with artificial intelligence and search.</p>
          <p>At an all-hands meeting Thursday, Google workers had the chance to pepper CEO Sundar Pichai and Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk with questions, according to CNBC, which said it obtained audio of the meeting.</p>
          <p>One worker asked the following question via Google’s internal forum Dory, according to CNBC:</p>
          <p>“Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”</p>
          <p>Krawczyk, making his all-hands debut, quickly responded, “I just want to be very clear: Bard is not search.”</p>
          <p>Instead, he said, it’s “a collaborative A.I. service.”</p>
          <p>“The magic that we’re finding in using the product is really around being this creative companion to helping you be the spark plug for imagination, explore your curiosity, etc.,” he said. But, he added, “We can’t stop users from trying to use it like search.”</p>
          <p>Of course, search is very much on the minds of Google investors and employees. When OpenAI shared its A.I. chatbot ChatGPT with the public in late November, thoughts immediately turned to how the technology might disrupt Google’s search dominance.</p>
          <p>Fears about that were hardly allayed when Microsoft launched a ChatGPT-powered rival to Google search last month. (It’s available to a limited number of users for now but will be more widely available soon.)</p>
          <p>Google responded last month with a video of a demo of Bard, but that was botched by a factual error from the chatbot concerning the James Webb Space Telescope. Wall Street promptly punished Google parent Alphabet, sending its shares down sharply.</p>
          <p>Another question on Thursday was about the demo, according to CNBC, with an employee asking, “The first public demo was demoralizing, sent our stock into a nosedive, and invited massive media coverage. What really happened?”</p>
          <p>“Questions like this can be fair and we want to reiterate the fact that Bard has not launched,” Krawczyk replied. “We acknowledged to the world that this is something that we’re experimenting with—we’re testing it. But there’s a lot of excitement in the industry right now.”</p>
          <p>Another worker reportedly commented, “Launching AI seems like a knee-jerk reaction without a strategy.”</p>
          <p>“I disagree with the premise of this question” Pichai responded, noting Google has been “working on A.I. for a long time.”</p>
          <p>Indeed, OpenAI was established in 2015 “as a counterweight to Google” in A.I., Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who helped start it, tweeted last month. He also complained that OpenAI had “become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” (Musk is now reportedly working to establish a rival to OpenAI.)</p>
          <p>But Google, though it’s long been strong on the A.I. research front, has much more to lose than anyone else if users start Googling less and turning to A.I. chatbots more for their search queries.</p>

          <p>Tokens of Shiba Inu-themed Floki can soon be used as collateral to borrow a basket of cryptocurrencies on Venus Protocol, the second-largest lending platform on the BNB Chain, Floki developers told CoinDesk on Friday.</p>
          <p>The move is part of a broader plan to make FLOKI, which was originally a meme coin named after billionaire Elon Musk's pet dog, as a serious decentralized-finance token.</p>
          <p>Venus provides a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing product that allows users to directly borrow against collateral at a high speed while losing less to transaction fees. It held over $800 million in locked tokens as of Friday.</p>
          <p>Venus will be integrating FLOKI in its money-market platform, thereby allowing FLOKI holders on the BNB Chain to borrow USDT, USDC, BNB and a basket of other cryptocurrencies while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
          <p>This allows FLOKI token holders to easily access liquidity without having to sell their tokens.</p>
          <p>The move is expected to benefit FLOKI holders, developers say, as they continue to build and seek strategic partnerships that ultimately benefit the token’s value.</p>
          <p>The FLOKI integration process on Venus has started, and is expected to be completed in March. After that, FLOKI holders will be able to seamlessly lend and borrow on Venus while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
          <p>FLOKI has so far been one of the strongest crypto performers this year, tripling in value over a 30-day rolling period, according to CoinGecko. Interest in the tokens has heightened in recent months following a $100 million token burn and a push to target Valhalla, Floki’s metaverse game, to the multibillion-dollar Chinese gaming market.</p>

          <p>On-chain liquidity and derivatives trading protocol Synthetix has deployed version 3 (v3) on the Ethereum mainnet following security audits, developers said Wednesday.</p>
          <p>Synthetix (SNX) is a protocol that enables the issuance of synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain – allowing users to mint, hold, and trade a wide range of derivatives – including commodities, fiat currencies, and even stocks.</p>
          <p>The protocol holds over $450 million in locked tokens over the Ethereum and Optimism blockchains as of Thursday. It held just shy of $3 billion in total locked value (TVL) at its February 2021 record high.</p>
          <p>Developers previously stated said that Synthetix v3 will have much more efficient architecture to allow developers to create faster, complex and more efficient decentralized financial (DeFi) applications.</p>
          <p>V3 will allow the creation of products that offer a liquid market for any financial derivative that developers want to build, from traditional financial markets to more exotic markets such as no-loss lotteries or even wholly separate protocols.</p>
          <p>V3 will also offer simplified staking and differentiated debt pools, allowing network stakers to supply collateral to, and receive fees from, specific asset pools without having to be exposed to every Spartan Council-supported asset.</p>
          <p>The Spartan Council (SC) is the central governing body of the Synthetix protocol that votes on overall improvement proposals and parameter changes.</p>
          <p>Synthetix’s native SNX tokens saw nominal price changes in the past 24 hours.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell in Wednesday morning trading in Asia along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon saw the biggest drop, while BNB dropped the least. A series of economic data in the U.S. released on Tuesday, including earnings reports from retail giants and the rising rate of some Treasury bills, weighed down on equity markets.</p>
          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin fell 1.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$24,442 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, though it was still up 10% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum fell 2.6% to US$1,658, rising 6.5% over the past seven days.</li>
            <li>Polygon lost 6.1% to US$1.39, though it still booked 10% gains over the past seven days. BNB fell 1.2% to US$311.48, but was still up 5.2% for the week.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.8% to US$1.11 trillion at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The total trading volume over the past 24 hours was up by 3.3% to US$66.70 billion.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday, which was the first trading day of the week, as markets closed on Monday for President’s Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%, the S&P 500 Index dropped 2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day down 2.5%.</li>
            <li>The three key indices posted the biggest single-day losses since Dec. 15 as the S&P 500 cut its year-to-date gains in half while the Dow Jones wiped out almost all of its 2023 gains.</li>
            <li>The two-year Treasury note yield rose to 4.7% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 3.9%. Elevated levels in Treasury bond yields represent a larger upside risk for yields, placing downward pressure on equities.</li>
            <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 policy meeting on Wednesday, which investors will look to for hints on how the central bank may act to tackle inflation.</li>
            <li>Retail giants Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc., released their holiday season earnings reports on Tuesday. Walmart’s revenue rose 7.3% to US$164 billion from the previous year, while Home Depot fell short of expectations, reporting US$35 billion in Q4 revenue. Both companies projected a challenging quarter ahead due to headwinds from supply chain shortages and ongoing inflation in the economy.</li>
            <li>Economic data released on Tuesday suggested that business activity in the U.S. is expanding. The S&P Global services purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to an 8-month high of 50.5 in February, up from 46.8 in the previous month, while the manufacturing PMI rose to a four-month high of 47.8 from 46.9.</li>
            <li>The Fed raised interest rates to the range of 4.5%-4.75% on Feb.1 to fight the inflation, the highest level since October 2007, with the latest Consumer Price Index data up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
            <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict a roughly 75% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

          <h3>Coinbase (COIN)</h3>
          <p>Coinbase Global shares jumped after the crypto exchange’s fourth-quarter revenue of $629.1 million came in above Wall Street expectations of $581.1 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg .</p>
          <p>The bar was set relatively low for Coinbase amid a sharp fall in trading volumes last quarter following a decline in crypto prices, the collapse of FTX.com, and increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>
          <p>“Coinbase and crypto proved to be largely resilient in 2022 despite major shocks to the system,” read the company’s shareholder letter. “Idiosyncratic events throughout 2022 exacerbated already weak macro conditions.”</p>
          <p>Coinbase slashed about 20% of its staff in January. The company says it expects a decrease in expenses of more than 30% given its reduced headcount.</p>
          <p>Coinbase shares, which lost about two-thirds of their value over the last year, have rallied sharply since the start of 2023, up roughly 80%. The rise comes amid a resurgence in the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which currently hovers above $24,300 per token.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks’ total revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2023 grew 26% year over year to $1.7 billion. Shares of the cybersecurity firm rallied in after hours.</p>
          <p>"We continue to see our teams execute well in the midst of macroeconomic challenges, helping customers consolidate their security architectures," said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date shares of the Palo Alto-based firm are up about 20% amid an overall rise in tech equities. Cybersecurity firms held up relatively well last year compared to the rest of technology stocks, as demand for keeping networks safe grows amid rising geo-political tensions.</p>
          <h3>Caesars Entertainment (CZR)</h3>
          <p>Caesars Entertainment posted fourth quarter net revenue of $2.8 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.</p>
          <p>The gambling company’s results were positively impacted by a continued consumer shift towards spending in services and experiences, from goods.</p>
          <p>"Our fourth quarter delivered another set of strong operating results as both our Las Vegas and Regional segments each set a new fourth quarter record for Adjusted EBITDA,” Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars Entertainment said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
          <h3>Toll Brothers (TOL)</h3>
          <p>Toll Brothers posted first-quarter earnings per share of $1.70 compared to $1.24 for the same period last year. The home builder also gave upbeat guidance after the housing market started to slow down last year.</p>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/stocks-moving.png" alt="ncx-stocks" />
          <p>“Since the start of the calendar year, we have seen a marked increase in demand beyond normal seasonality as buyer confidence appears to be improving,” Douglas Yearley, Jr., chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers, said in the company's earnings release.</p>
          <p>Toll Brothers reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance for an adjusted gross margin of 27% and an earnings per share range between $8.00 and $9.00.</p>
          <p>U.S. existing home sales fell to the lowest level in more than 12 years in January, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors. However the pace of decline slowed, signaling the housing market slowdown could could soon be bottoming.</p>

          <p>STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network, is surging as the recent arrival of the Ordinals protocol has unleashed a new narrative of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
          <p>Stacks Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 for smart contracts focused on establishing the world's biggest and oldest blockchain programmable – a dominant feature of Ethereum and its competitors like Solana, which currently account for a majority of global NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.</p>
          <p>Stacks has a separate ledger to store data outside the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications similar to those on Ethereum and Solana. STX, known for being the first token offering qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is used to incentivize Stacks miners and participants in the proposed Stacks bitcoin (sBTC) system, which is aimed at making bitcoin fully programmable.</p>
          <p>The token has risen nearly 50% to $0.60 in the past 24 hours, taking the month-to-date gain to 125%. Prices were quoted as high as $0.84 early Monday, the highest since May, CoinDesk data show. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin (BTC) has risen just 6% this month.</p>
          <p>The outsized move comes as the crypto community goes gaga over Ordinals, which went live on Jan. 21, allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, Ordinals are like drawing artwork directly on satoshi (sats), the lowest denomination of a bitcoin, while NFTs on Ethereum are analogous to an authenticity certificate from the creator that is separate from ether.</p>
          <p>The number of newly created Ordinals or NFTs inscribed directly into Satoshis on Bitcoin crossed the 100,000 mark last week, causing network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
          <p>Per Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, the growing popularity of Ordinals would bode well for layer 2 solutions.</p>
          <p>"Ordinals on Bitcoin L1 are complementary to Bitcoin NFTs on L2s like Stacks. Ordinals have a natural limit on the L1 scale, and L2s provide a clear scalability path," Ali tweeted Monday. "Wallets like Xverse and & Hiro are amongst the first to release or work on Ordinals."</p>
          <p>Activity in NFTs on Stacks has picked up in the wake of the Ordinals' rising popularity. Data from DappRadar shows trading volume on Gamma.io, a Stack-based Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has increased by more than 1,000% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, volumes on Megapont have increased by 125%. Per data tweeted by Ali, there is an active community of artists and creators on Stacks and people have minted 650K Bitcoin NFTs on the layer 2 solution.</p>
          <p>"Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin blockchain has been very successful, leading to a general Bitcoin NFT fever," CK Cheung, investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, said. "Stacks is a beneficiary of this as it is an L2 supporting smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin Network. People could mint new Bitcoin NFTs on top of Stacks with a lower cost and higher speed."</p>
          <p>Last week, the bitcoin-focused Web 3 wallet Xverse rolled out support for Ordinals. At the same time, Hiro Wallet added support for inscriptions on its testnet, with Ali describing the same as Metamask for Bitcoin.</p>
          <p>Early this month, Gamma.io unveiled a no-code creator platform for NFTs on native Bitcoin through the use of ordinals, opening doors for users to create inscriptions without having to run a full Bitcoin node or write any code. Gamma's new launch essentially made Ordinals accessible to everyone.</p>
          <p>"Ordinals (inscriptions) are similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the smallest value of Bitcoin (satoshis). This is now opening up the use case for NFTs and merging them with the Bitcoin network security layer," Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in an email while pointing to the upcoming "Building on Bitcoin Hackathon" as the key event to watch out for in the short term.</p>
          <p>The hackathon, scheduled from Feb. 24 to March 7, will have participants build their own smart contracts using Clarity, programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.</p>
          <p>"This virtual hackathon is driving a lot of attention as Stacks uses 'Clarity,' a programming language for writing smart contracts that might be easier to learn than Solidity. The hackathon will reveal in the next two weeks if everybody can now build smart contracts without too much technical knowledge," Thielen noted.</p>
          <p>Finally, on top of all this, STX is seemingly drawing a haven bid, according to Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik.</p>
          <p>"STX is also one of the rare tokens approved by the SEC. So in these uncertain times when the regulator is going after a lot of crypto companies, an SEC-approved token also sounds like a good thing to the market," Malik said.</p>

          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ordinal Inscriptions are similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin, as they allow users to mint images, videos, and even video games on satoshis, which benefit from the inherent immutability of the network.</li>
            <li>The upgrade was developed in the past year by software engineer Caser Rodarmor and relies on Bitcoin’s SegWit and Taproot upgrades to function.</li>
            <li>As interest in NFTs on proof-of-work blockchains strengthens, software engineer Anthony Guerrera launched Ordinals on the Litecoin network on Feb.19, motivated by the 22 Litecoin (US$2,066) bounty posted by pseudonymous Twitter user Indigo Nakamotoist.</li>
            <li>Guerrera told Decrypt that Litecoin was the only other blockchain that could support Ordinals because it also included Bitcoin’s SegWit and Taproot upgrades.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin was down 0.56% in the 24 hours to 7:45 p.m. Hong Kong time, trading at US$24,686. Litecoin was down 3.76% trading at US$93.86, according to CoinMarketCap.</li>

          <p>Bitcoin is closing in on $25,000 per coin as the entire cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose to $1.17tn.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation was trading at $24,500 on Monday, up 12.4% in the past week.</p>
          <p>The second largest cryptocurrency ethereum ETH-USD stood at $1,689 as of the time of writing, up 11.7% in the last seven days.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin shot above $25,000 late on Sunday evening UK time as Asia began the working week, revealing a positive price-movement signal.</p>
          <p>Other cryptocurrencies such as Solana SOL-USD, Polkadot DOT-USD, and Polygon MATIC-USD also experienced gains, with increases of 20%, 19%, and 18.5% in the past week respectively.</p>
          <p>Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told Coindesk that $23,000 was bitcoin’s new support level, adding that the coming week would decide whether the digital asset would hit $30,000 or not.</p>
          <p>He said: “It was critical for bitcoin to reclaim $23,000 if we were to see more upside action.</p>
          <p>“With February coming to an end, another bullish monthly close may be what the market needs for bitcoin to test $30,000.”</p>
          <p>On Monday morning bitcoin trader Matthew Hyland tweeted: "Bitcoin lower time frame, really hard to tell if the big breakout above $25.2k comes right here."</p>
          <p>Hyland tweeted a chart that suggested bitcoin would drop to a low of around $22,000 before rebounding above $25,000.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin is heading into a quiet week in terms of macroeconomic triggers that could affect the price. There are a few US data releases, such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, coming up.</p>
          <p>All eyes are on the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting being held on 15 and 16 March where a decision for the next benchmark interest rate hike will be made. Futures markets are pricing in a less hawkish Federal Reserve, forecasting a 25 basis point rate hike at the meeting in March.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Binance secretly moved large sums of money from its supposedly independent US partner to a company managed by the crypto giant's boss Changpeng Zhao, according to Reuters</p>
          <p>The publication said Thursday that Binance's US partner started transferring money to Merit Peak in 2020 and sent the trading firm over $400 million in the first quarter of 2021, citing banking records and company messages.</p>
          <p>Merit Peak is a market-maker trading firm owned by Binance CEO Zhao, who's often referred to by his initials CZ.</p>
          <p>Binance claims that Merit Peak and Binance's US partner Binance.US operate independently from the global exchange, which CZ co-founded in 2017.</p>
          <p>But Binance.US executives didn't know that it had been sending money to Merit Peak and were concerned when this came to light, according to company messages seen by Reuters.</p>
          <p>Then-CEO Catherine Coley reportedly asked a Binance executive for an explanation in late 2020, calling the transfers "unexpected" and saying that "no one mentioned them".</p>
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has previously probed ties between Binance.US, Merit Peak, and another CZ-owned trading firm called Sigma Chain AG, according to a Wall Street Journal report published in February 2022.</p>
          <p>Binance.US did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment.</p>
          <p>It's not clear why the money was sent from Binance.US to Merit Peak or if any of the funds belonged to US customers.</p>
          <p>Reuters reported in November that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had used at least $4 billion of customers' money to prop up Alameda Research, a supposedly independent trading firm that he managed.</p>
          <p>FTX had already filed for bankruptcy when that story broke but Bankman-Fried was subsequently arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the US to face eight counts of fraud.</p>

          <p>It's been a tough couple of years for Chinese stocks. The Covid pandemic, and Beijing's zero-Covid policy, have slammed the economy. Meanwhile, regulatory crackdowns vs. technology and data-centric firms such as Alibaba, Tencent TCEHY and NetEase NTES have been a major headwind. The tech crackdown seems to have eased.</p>
          <p>U.S. tensions are a concern. In recent months, the White House has barred shipments of key chip technology to China, adding to tariffs and other curbs on Chinese goods. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, China has rolled back Covid restrictions significantly. With an end to lockdowns and other severe controls, a massive wave of infections took hold. But investors are looking beyond to brighter days ahead. With China New Year holidays out of the way, will the Chinese economy finally rebound?</p>
          <p>While the current top China stocks to buy or watch are dominated by e-commerce plays, don't forget EV startups such as Nio (NIO) and Li Auto (LI). Like global giant BYD (BYDDF), all are taking on Tesla (TSLA) in the world's largest EV market.</p>
          <h3>Tencent Stock</h3>
          <p>Tencent is China's messaging and gaming giant, with major payments exposure and with key holdings in an array of Chinese companies, including JD.com.</p>
          <p>Earnings have declined for the past four quarters, and revenue for the past two, as a big crackdown on internet platforms and new mobile games took a toll. Earnings growth is expected to return in 2023.</p>
          <p>JD.com stock peaked at 94.46 in February 2021, tumbling to a five-year low of 23.52 on Oct. 24, 2022. Since then shares have doubled, vaulting above moving averages</p>
          <p>Shares hit 52.88 on Jan. 27 and have pulled back. TECHY stock has fallen below its 50-day line.</p>
          <p>Ideally, Tencent would forge a new base after its big run.</p>
          <p>Tencent stock is listed in Hong Kong and trades over the counter in the U.S.</p>

          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-24-1.webp" alt="ncx-blog" />
          <p>Bitcoin saw this week’s second-biggest gains among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, followed by Polygon’s Matic that rose 13.33% to US$1.44.</p>
          <p>“I am expecting a slightly sideways move. The market has to calm a little before any further impulses,” wrote Aziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange GammaX, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
          <p>“There is massive support and a strong buy orders wall which might push Bitcoin further towards US$29,000-30,000 in early March. However, there also is a strong support zone at US$22,250. If that support withholds, we might see another impulse toward US$25,300,” wrote Kenjaev, adding that “there will be more speculations over the SEC and Paxos, so keep your newsfeed open.”</p>
          <p>Kenjaev sees less correlation between traditional and crypto markets, as prices are mainly driven by industry developments.</p>
          <p>“The cryptocurrency market is more focused on developments inside its own ecosystem and the connectivity of this decentralized ecosystem to the centralized one. Hence, every development related to the regulators vs crypto companies, especially U.S. regulators, does and will affect the crypto market,” wrote Kenjaev.</p>
          <p>“Be mindful of the release, testing, deployment and adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The major macroeconomic data I would like to see is the national debt. There has been a lot of money spent in recent years and governments will be looking to recover it,” wrote Kanjaev, adding that “the government knows that there is a good portion of funds floating in Web3.”</p>
          <p>The global crypto market cap stood at US$1.09 trillion on Friday at 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 6.86% from US$1.02 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$458 billion market cap represented 42.2% of the market, while Ether accounted for 18.7%.</p>
          <h3>Biggest Gainers</h3>
          <p>Astar Network’s Astr token was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Astar Network is a multi-chain smart contract network focused on Web3 innovation.</p>
          <p>Astr rallied 51.72% this past week to change hands at US$0.1099 after the announcement of its partnership with Sony to launch a Web3 incubation program to support developers building Web3 projects.</p>
          <p>Decentralized gaming developer’s Magic token was the second biggest gainer, up 44.94% to trade at US$2.18. The token started its rally on Feb. 13, after the company launched a new Game Builders Program supported by Arbitrum to incentivize high-potential games building on Treasure, by offering developers access to open-source code as well as advisory and marketing support.</p>
          <h3>Next Week</h3>
          <p>For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, a “death cross” appeared on its weekly chart. This meant that the 50-week small moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator, stood below the 200-week SMA for the first time.</p>
          <p>Kasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, said that the death cross “gives very little input,” since it only shows that Bitcoin price performed better in the last 50 weeks compared to the last 200 weeks.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin prices charted another significant formation, with its first “golden cross” on the daily timeframe since the beginning of the crypto bear market in November 2021. A golden cross means that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. Historically, Bitcoin has charted multiple golden crosses in previous cycles before a sustained rally.</p>
          <p>“A record high 66.9% of circulating BTC has not moved in over a year,” tweeted Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, adding that “Bitcoin bear markets end when there are no sellers remaining, the price slowly starts drifting up due to (any) marginal buyer, and the next wave of adopters learn BTC is the least uncertain money.”</p>
          <p>According to Kenjaev, this suggests that Bitcoin holders were more conservative. “They are waiting for the right time to sell and are hedging over the upcoming recession. The state of the global economic conditions now leads to more uncertainty than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The reason why the situation is not changing with current global developments is that investors do not see the same scenario happening. Current market conditions look risk-attractive and favorable, although it’s very early to call it the next bull run. We shall at the very least wait for improvements from regulatory bodies globally.”</p>
          <p>“Some patterns suggest that an ideal scenario for Bitcoin would be to drop near US$19,500-19,300,” he added, hoping for “a decline to US$19,500 and a jump to US$30,000.”</p>
          <p>On Feb. 12, Blockstream chief executive officer Adam Back predicted that Bitcoin would exceed US$200 million in market cap, bringing BTC prices to US$10 million by 2032.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin and Ether rebounded in Thursday morning trading in Asia amid broad gains in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies after a bout of profit-taking and mixed economic indicators sent prices lower on Wednesday. Solana, Polygon and Cardano led gains among the top 10 by market capitalization. U.S. equities were mixed overnight. Tesla beat earnings forecasts but the poor outlook from Microsoft on Wednesday and an interest rate hike expected next week kept a lid on trading.</p>
          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin rose 2% to US$23,096 in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen 11.66% in the seven days to date and resumed a strong run up since the start of the year after hitting a speed bump on Wednesday. Ether added 3.43% to US$1,610, up 6.36% in the same week, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
            <li>Solana jumped 7.78% to US$24.56 to post a week-to-date growth of 17.9%. Solana recently opened pre-orders for its blockchain-focused mobile phone Solana Saga, which is expected to launch as early as Q1 this year.</li>
            <li>Polygon added 3.85% to US$0.99 after the Fractal NFT gaming site on Wednesday said it was expanding onto the Polygon network. Cardano rose by 3.91% to US$0.37.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization grew 2.72% to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume saw a 12% increase to US$61.86 billion.</li>
            <li>U.S. equity markets had a mixed day on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dipped almost 0.2%.</li>
            <li>More economic indicators are out on Thursday in the U.S., including GDP, durable goods orders and jobless claims, which could provide direction to equities through the end of the week.</li>
            <li>Members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are in a so-called blackout period before they meet next week – Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 – to decide the next move on interest rates. Analysts from CME Group predict a 99.8% chance of an increase of 25 basis points.</li>
            <li>Last month, the Fed raised interest rates by 50-basis points to between 4.25% and 4.5%, the highest in 15 years, to try and slow the pace of inflation and a number of indicators suggest that slowdown is happening. However, some investors remain concerned about the U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, tipping into a recession.</li>

          <p>NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced in choppy trading on Thursday as investors grappled with an onslaught of economic data and a string of mixed corporate earnings, all while eyeing the clock as it ticks down toward next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.</p>
          <p>While all three major U.S. stock indexes were green, megacap momentum stocks, buoyed by Tesla Inc's earnings beat and upbeat sales forecast, helped put the Nasdaq in the lead.</p>
          <p>A raft of data showed the U.S. economy fared better in the fourth quarter than analysts expected, and the labor market remains tight, despite some signs of weakening demand. This is a double-edged sword for investors, as it could embolden the Fed to keep key interest rates at restrictive levels for longer.</p>
          <p>While financial markets have largely priced in a 25 basis point rate from the central bank next Wednesday, that sentiment is not unanimous.</p>
          <p>The data "suggests a 50-basis-point rate hike next week and 25 basis points in March, and then possibly an end to the tightening cycle," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "I think the Fed wants to make sure that the markets don’t get ahead of themselves."</p>
          <p>"(The Fed tightening) hasn't worked its way through the system, but you’re beginning to see cracks in consumption and inflation," Cardillo added. "I'm sure the Fed is going to take note of that."</p>
          <p>Fourth-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with more than one fourth of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 69% have beaten consensus estimates, up from 67% on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv.</p>
          <p>Analysts now see aggregate fourth quarter earnings falling 2.7%, worse than the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1, but an improvement over the 3% annual decline as of Wednesday, per Refinitiv.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.4 points, or 0.26%, to 33,831.24, the S&P 500 gained 24 points, or 0.60%, to 4,040.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 122.49 points, or 1.08%, to 11,435.85.</p>
          <p>Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy led the percentage gainers, boosted by rising crude prices due to signs of increasing demand from China.</p>
          <p>Tesla Inc provided the most upside muscle to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, its shares jumping 9.4% in the wake of its earnings report.</p>
          <p>Chevron Corp announced it would triple its budget for share buybacks, which sent the oil major's stock up 4.4%.</p>
          <p>Among losers, IBM Corp fell 4.3% in the wake of its announcement that it would cut jobs divest some assets after falling short of its annual cash target.</p>
          <p>Southwest Airlines Co slid 4.0% after warning of current quarter losses.</p>
          <p>And despite forecasts of strong demand for air travel in 2023, the broader S&P 1500 Airlines index was off 1.6%.</p>
          <p>That might have something to do with Mastercard Inc's disappointing current quarter revenue forecast, cited an expected diminishing pent-up travel demand. The consumer payments company's shares were down 1.7%.</p>
          <p>Mastercard rival Visa Inc is due to post results after the bell, as is chip bellwether Intel Corp.</p>
          <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 26 new lows (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Johann M Cherian and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 metric showed a price correction while Ethereum continued an uptrend.</p>
          <p>Percent Supply in Profit was over 67% at press time, representing a four-month high for Ethereum.</p>
          <p>The price of Ethereum [ETH] rose dramatically over the last few days, which indicated a bull trend. Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.</p>
          <h3>Ethereum and equity prices go in opposite directions</h3>
          <p>Recent information indicated that Ethereum’s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment’s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.</p>
          <p>When the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.</p>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <p>The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor’s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.</p>
          <h3>Percent Supply in Profit hits four-month high</h3>
          <p>Besides the stock market’s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.</p>
          <p>The graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.</p>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <h3>MVRV shows reduced loss</h3>
          <p>When the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of Ethereum.</p>
          <p>Though a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.</p>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <h3>Ethereum remains in the overbought zone</h3>
          <p>A daily timeframe chart of Ethereum’s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory.</p>
