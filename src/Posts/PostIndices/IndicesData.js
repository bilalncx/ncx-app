    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures rose modestly Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, even as Treasury yields rebounded. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and a big speech from Fed chief Jerome Powell lie ahead.</p>
    	<p>Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reported Friday night, with PANW stock surging early Monday. U.K. regulators cleared the Broadcom (AVGO) takeover of VMware (VMW) Monday, with the U.S. taking no action. Only China is left to OK the Broadcom-VMware deal. VMW stock popped, while Broadcom edged higher.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market fell into a correction last week, as the key indexes tumbled below their 50-day lines and leading stocks broke hard with Treasury yields surging to 15-year highs. The indexes did bounce off lows Friday as the 10-year yield fell back, but the picture hasn't fundamentally changed.</p>	
    	<p>Friday could just be a short-term bounce. Investors should wait for sustained strength. Nvidia's earnings and Fed chief Powell's Jackson Hole speech could be market catalysts, but which way?</p>
      <p>Investors should be defensive during the market correction, but looking for stocks that are holding up relatively well. Arista Networks (ANET), Diamond Offshore (DO), Commercial Metals (CMC), Visa (V), Boeing (BA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are six stocks to watch, along with Nvidia.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia stock is on IBD Leaderboard. ANET stock is on the IBD 50. Google stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20. Diamond Offshore was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>	
    	<p>The video embedded in the article discussed a big market week and analyzed Google, Boeing and DO stock.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.3% above fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.45% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.6%.</p>	
    	<p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose a few basis points to 4.3%.</p>	
    	<p>Crude oil futures climbed more than 1%.</p>
      <p>China's Hang Seng index fell 1.8%. Overnight, China's central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.45% from 3.55%, but unexpectedly kept its five-year loan prime rate at 4.2%. Chinese financial regulators met with state-owned banks, once again telling lenders to boost loans along with various housing-related measures, according to a central statement released Sunday. Beijing has pledged support frequently for a faltering economy, but has relied on rate cuts and regulatory tweaks or prodding vs. fiscal stimulus.</p>	
    	<p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Palo Alto Earnings</h3>	
    	<p>Palo Alto earnings beat views late Friday, while revenue just missed. The cybersecurity giant guided up on earnings but down slightly for revenue.</p>
      <p>Friday night earnings reports are rare, so the timing had raised investor concerns.</p>
      <p>PANW stock jumped nearly 13% in premarket trading Monday. Shares rose 1% to 209.69 in Friday's session after falling to 201.07 intraday, testing a prior buy point around 203. But Palo Alto stock has dived 16.1% in August through Friday's close.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Correction</h3>
      <p>A stock market correction took hold last week, with big losses for the major indexes and leading stocks. Rising Treasury yields and mounting China economic concerns were big headwinds.</p>	
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index sank 2.1%. The Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 skidded 3.4%.</p>	
    	<p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 8 basis points this week to 4.25%, even with Friday's retreat of nearly six basis points. During the week, the 10-year yield came within a fraction of the 15-year high of 4.331% set in October 2022. It did set its highest close since late 2007.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.3% to $81.25 a barrel last week.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>	
    	<p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) tumbled 3.7% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) retreated 1.5%. PANW stock is in IGV. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) lost a fraction. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 SMH holding.</p>	
    	<p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) rose 0.5% last week, with CMC stock a significant holding. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) sank 2.6%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 4.7%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) plunged 4.4%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) fell 1.2%, snapping a five-week win streak. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) retreated 1.6%. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) declined 2.4%, with BA stock a major holding.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) retreated 2.8%, with Visa stock a top-10 member. And the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) tumbled 6.4%.</p>	
    	<p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 5.5% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 4.9%.</p>	
      <h3>Nvidia Earnings</h3>
    	<p>It's fair to say that expectations are high heading into Nvidia earnings on Wednesday night. Q1 results were stellar while the Q2 guidance was spectacular. Meanwhile, at least five Wall Street analysts pounded the table for Nvidia last week, upgrading the chip giant or raising NVDA stock price targets. Two more raised price targets on Monday.</p>
      <p>So strong results and guidance could fail to lift Nvidia stock.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia stock actually popped 6% in the past week to 432.99, fueled by Monday's 7.6% surge. Shares flirted with an aggressive entry, but then faded to end the week just below the 50-day line.</p>	
    	<p>Shares rose nearly 3% early Monday amid the ongoing bullish analyst comments, signaling a move back above the 50-day and 21-day lines.</p>	
    	<p>Investors could use Tuesday's high of 452.68 as an early entry. Nvidia stock is on track to have a new base at the end of this week.</p>
      <p>Nvidia earnings will likely have a big impact on the broader market, especially chip and AI plays.</p>	
      <h3>Fed Chief Powell's Jackson Hole Speech</h3>
    	<p>Fed chief Jerome Powell will give a policy speech on Friday, Aug. 25, at the annual Jackson Hole symposium.</p>	
    	<p>Fed chief Powell is likely to signal patience about further rate hikes, while still leaving the door open, and pushing back on the prospects for rate cuts. With inflation still too high but coming down, policymakers see less urgency to act. A big jump in Treasury yields means that market rates have tightened considerably in the past few weeks, further reducing the need for official Fed rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Another reason to wait and see? While U.S. economic growth is solid, Europe and China are showing weakness and could be a drag on U.S. inflation and growth ahead.</p>
      <p>Of course, a hawkish Powell speech could upend rate-hike expectations. Investors see scant chance of a Fed rate hike in late September, with modest odds of a hike by the Nov. 1 meeting.</p>
      <h3>Stocks Near Buy Zones</h3>	
    	<p>ANET stock rose 3.25% to 180.62 last week, regaining a 178.36 buy point. Strong Cisco (CSCO) earnings and orders buoyed peer rival Arista Networks. Shares have been trading relatively tight following an earnings gap-up, with the relative strength line continuing to climb.</p>	
    	<p>DO stock jumped 5% on Friday to 15.96, rebounding from the 21-day and 50-day lines and breaking a trendline in an emerging consolidation. Diamond Offshore is among many oil drillers, machinery and services firms showing strength.</p>
      <p>Google stock fell 1.9% on Friday to 127.46, closing above the 127.10 cup-with-handle buy point after briefly undercutting that. Investors could buy the internet giant here, but getting above the 132 area would clear the bulk of a shelf.</p>	
    	<p>Visa stock found support at the 50-day line on Friday, also holding a 235.57 buy point from a flat base. The Dow Jones payments giant has been trading tightly in the buy zone for some weeks, and now has a new flat base, or base-on-base pattern, with a 245.37 buy point. A move above the Aug. 10 high of 243.95 could be a good place to enter.</p>
      <p>CMC stock rose 1.7% to 55.99 last week, working on a 56.49 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, according to MarketSmith analysis. Commercial Metals flirted with breaking the handle's downtrend a few times. The specialty steel play is trading around the 21-day line while the 10-week has nearly caught up,</p>	
    	<p>BA stock fell 3.8% to 226.76 last week, getting as low as 221.68 on Friday morning, round-tripping an 8.6% advance from a 223.91 flat-base buy point. But Boeing stock found support at the 50-day/10-week line and closed in buy range. A move above the 21-day line, especially if it coincided with a reviving market, might offer a place to buy shares.</p>
      <h3>Market Analysis</h3> 
      <p>The stock market is in a correction. The key indexes have all fallen below their 50-day lines, especially the Nasdaq.</p>	
    	<p>While Arista Networks, Boeing, Visa, Diamond Offshore and Google stock are in buy areas, most leading stocks have suffered significant damage that could take several days, weeks or months to repair.</p>
      <p>Winners outpaced losers on Friday, but market breadth has been terrible, especially on the Nasdaq.</p>	
    	<p>Friday's rebound from intraday lows was nice to see, but the market was "due" for a bounce. But we don't know if that will last more than a day or two. The 50-day line would be key resistance for the Nasdaq and many stocks.</p>
      <p>Friday marks day one of a stock market rally attempt. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edged lower Friday, they closed in the upper half of their range, so that qualifies as a "pink" rally day for those indexes. The Dow Jones finished slightly higher.</p>	
    	<p>The market rally attempt continues until the indexes undercut Friday's lows.</p>
      <p>A follow-through day could come as soon as Wednesday, though it could be weeks away. As a practical matter, a FSD seems unlikely before Nvidia earnings Wednesday night. Powell's Jackson Hole speech Friday also could be the trigger for a new confirmed market rally.</p>	
    	<p>But these events also could spur much-bigger losses for the now-shallow correction.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield is a major stock market driver right now. Despite Friday's sharp decline the 10-year yield has risen for five straight weeks, up 43 basis points.</p>	
    	<h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>Investors shouldn't get excited over Friday's bounce. One day doesn't make a trend. Investors should have pared exposure significantly over the past couple of weeks. If you still feel too exposed, you could use market bounces as a chance to sell further.</p>
      <p>For those so inclined, a brief market bounce could create shorting opportunities.</p>	
    	<p>The market could have a short correction, with Nvidia and Fed chief Powell reviving bullish sentiment. Or the selling could intensify.</p>
      <p>Don't try to guess what the market will do. Pay attention to what the market is doing, and be prepared. Keep updating your watchlists, focusing on stocks showing relative strength. Those names could change significantly during the correction.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stocks in Europe moved higher by the afternoon on Monday in London as further evidence of price falls in the UK housing market hit.</p>
    	<p>The FTSE (^FTSE) was trading 0.3% higher while Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was up 0.6% and the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris rose 1%.</p>	
    	<p>Average asking prices for UK homes listed by new sellers fell by £7,012 to £364,895 this month, or about 1.9%, according to fresh data from online real estate portal Rightmove (RMV.L).</p>
      <p>This was coupled with a falling number of agreed sales, which were 15% lower than levels seen in 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the data showed that rents continue to creep up, meaning it is becoming more attractive for first-time buyers to enter the market. The number of first-time buyers was above the average — sitting at 10% lower than levels seen in 2019.</p>	
    	<p>Elsewhere, China adjusted its mortgage rates causing jitters in its markets during the trading day.</p>
      <p>Stay with us for live updates throughout the day:</p>
      <h3>Here are our tickers to watch today</h3>
      <p>Retail stocks and energy are propping up the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) today. Here's the lowdown on the top risers as of 10.25am:</p>
      <p>BP (BP.L) 1.7% ⬆️</p>
      <p>Shell (SHEL.L) 1.25% ⬆️</p>
      <p>Tesco (TSCO.L) 1.6% ⬆️</p>
      <p>JD Sports (JD.L) 1.3% ⬆️</p>
      <p>Burberry (BRBY.L) 1% ⬆️</p>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) just fell about 0.1% against the dollar, but it remains above the $1.27 mark, which has been a resistance point of late.</p>
      <p>Jackson Hole, the meeting of central bankers in the US between 24 and 26 August, will be the event to watch this week in terms of monitoring for price changes in FX.</p>
      <p>Some new charting on inflation from the ONS:</p>
      <p>The ONS notes that the sharp fall in the 12-month inflation rate in August 2020 reflects the Eat Out to Help Out scheme introduced by the British government to support the hospitality industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a corresponding sharp increase in the inflation rate in August 2021 because of the base effect.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there's some turmoil in the natural gas market due to supply concerns in Australia. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto Trading has the update:</p>
      <p><strong>Natural gas prices rose sharply in Europe amid supply concerns in Australia. US prices edged up, trading about 4% above Friday’s lows early on Monday. Union talks in Australia are due on Wednesday and traders are concerned about the potential for supply disruptions if a deal cannot be achieved. Meanwhile crude oil prices rallied for a third day to clear the 21-day EMA, with spot WTI north of $81 for a one-week high.</strong></p>
      <p>Elsewhere, real estate-related stocks are also in trouble this morning,:</p>
      <p>Taylor Wimpey (TW.L) 3.4% ⬇️</p>
      <p>Persimmon (PSN.L) 2.8% ⬇️</p>
      <p>Barratt (BDEV.L) 2.1% ⬇️</p>
      <p>Continuing the real estate theme this morning, housebuilder Crest Nicholson (CRST.L) has issued a profit warning amid "worsened" trading conditions over the summer.</p>
      <p>It blamed the chill on the increased borrowing costs for first-time buyers as things have become "significantly more expensive".</p>
      <p>Stock was down 10.5% by 9.15am in London as it said its sales-per-outlet-per-week which was running at 0.5 for the first half of the year has pulled back to 0.25 for H2.</p>
      <h3>Overnight in the US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Chinese stocks pulled back further on Monday after the country moved to stabilise the economy via changes to rates linked to mortgages. Beijing kept the key interest which guides mortgage rates on hold, but made a cut to another shorter-term rate.</p>
      <p>The People's Bank of China kept the five-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 4.2% when the expectation was it would be cut by 15bp. Meanwhile, the one-year LPR was cut by 10bp to 3.45%.</p>
      <p>Chinese stocks had been in the doldrums in recent weeks due to fears of stagnating growth.</p>
      <p>The Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong closed 1.9% lower, while the SSE Composite (000001.SS) was 1.2% lower. In Japan, the Nikkei (^N225) rose 0.4%.</p>
      <p>After a week of relative volatility in US markets due to signals on inflation, major indexes made muted moves at the close on Friday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was almost flat, while the Dow (^DJI) rose 0.1% and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) lost 0.2%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stocks look set to start the week as they ended on Friday: focused on Fed rate risks and China's weakening post-Covid recovery.</p>
    	<p>U.S. equity futures rebounded pre-market trading Monday, while Treasury bond yields edged higher and the dollar held steady against its global peers, as investors continue to weigh the impact of China's weakening economy, and the threat of higher Federal Reserve interest rates, on a sputtering domestic stock market.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 ended modestly lower Friday, capping another down week that has taken the biggest U.S. benchmark more than 5% lower from its late July peak amid a surge in longer-term Treasury bond yields tied, in part, to the surprising outperformance of the U.S. economy.</p>	
    	<p>Investors will be looking for direction from Powell with respect to the Fed's near-term rate plans, particularly in light of the resilient U.S. economy, which the Atlanta Fed suggests is growing at a 5.8% clip, more than twice the pace of the 2.4% growth recorded over the three months ending in June.</p>
      <p>At last year's Jackson Hole summit, Powell warned that the rate hikes needed to tame inflation, which was then running at more than 8%, would require "some pain" for American consumers. Since then, however, headline CPI has fallen to 3.2%, the unemployment rate has retreated to a five-decade low of 3.5% and the economy has continued to outpace its global rivals.</p>
      <p>Whether or not that performance will lead to higher Fed rates, however, remains to be seen, with the CME Group's FedWatch pricing in a just an 11.5% chance of a September rate hike ahead of Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming symposium later this week.</p>
      <p>That said, 10-year Treasury note yields were back above 4.3% level in overnight dealing, extending an August move that has added 33 basis points to the benchmark paper, with 2-year notes also rising to 4.973% -- more than triple the current dividend yield for the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currency peers, was marked 0.12% lower at 103.356 as markets adopted a modestly more aggressive appetite for risk heading into the Monday session.</p>
      <p>That optimism wasn't tied to overnight events in China, however, where the central bank trimmed another key lending benchmark -- the 1-year Loan Prime Rate -- by a less-than-expected 10 basis points, and left the longer 5-year rate unchanged, as part of its piecemeal effort to revive its moribund economy.</p>
      <p>Stocks in Hong Kong extended their run of declines to a seventh consecutive session, falling 1.5%, while further weakness in China pulled the region-wide Asia ex-Japan index deeper into its two-month low.</p>
      <p>European stocks were firmer, however, and largely tracking U.S. markets in early Frankfurt trading, with the Stoxx 600 rising 0.62% and the FTSE 100 gaining 0.24% in London.</p>
      <p>Heading into the start of the trading day on Wall Street, futures tied to the S&P 500, which is down 4.78% for the month, were priced for a 15 point opening bell gain.</p>
      <p>Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, suggest a 65 point advance while the tech-focused Nasdaq, blunted by the ongoing rise in Treasury yields, is priced for an 80 point opening bell bump.</p>
      <p>Chipmaker Nvidia NVDA, which published blowout quarterly earnings in late May that effectively kick-started the rally in AI-related stocks around the world, will publish its second quarter update after the close of trading on Wednesday, with investors looking for the sector's 'kingmaker' to report a bottom line of $2.07 per share on revenue of $11.131 billion.</p>
      <p>Earlier this spring Nvidia forecast current-quarter revenue of around $11 billion, more than 50% ahead of Wall Street estimates, with a gross margin of around 70%, which equates to earnings in the region of $2.04 a share.</p>
      <p>The group's near-term sales outlook, however, will be crucial in determining if companies are putting real investment dollars into their much-hyped AI strategies.</p>
      <p>he stock was marked 2.6% higher in pre-market trading following a price target upgrade from KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p>
      <p>The second quarter earnings season will also wind to a close this week, with 12 S&P 500 companies reporting over the next five days, including retailers Lowe's Companies  (LOW) - Get Free Report, Macy's  (M) - Get Free Report, Kohl's  (KSS) - Get Free Report, Dollar Tree  (DLTR) - Get Free Report, Nordstrom  (JWN) - Get Free Report and GAP  (GPS) - Get Free Report.</p>
      <p>With 472 companies in the S&P 500 reporting so far, collective earnings are set to fall 3.4% from last year to a share-weighted $449.8 billion. That total is likely to rebound over the third quarter, however, with earnings expected to rise 1.3% to a $46.2 billion over the three months ending in September.</p>

    	<p>U.S. stock futures were rising early on Monday after another losing week. Earnings from Nvidia and messages from the Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers are set to be the highlights of the week.</p>
	    <p>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures pointed up 0.6%.</p>	
    	<p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was leading the gains as investors look ahead to the earnings of chip maker Nvidia on Wednesday, which are expected to show whether investment in artificial-intelligence technology is holding up.</p>	
    	<p>Later in the week attention will shift to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his remarks at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium for central bankers. The event kicks off on Thursday evening and features a speech by Powell on Friday morning which will be watched for clues to the Fed’s interest-rate path.</p>
      <p>“As recently as early June, futures were still expecting a rate cut from the Fed by the end of 2023. But they now don’t see a full 25bp [basis points] cut priced in until the May 2024 meeting.

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures were little changed early Friday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.</p>
    	<p>Applied Materials (AMAT) and Ross Stores (ROST) headlined overnight earnings, with Deere (DE) and China EV startup XPeng (XPEV) due early Friday.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market continued to bleed on Thursday while Treasury yields kept rising. The major indexes tried to hold their ground, helped by Cisco Systems (CSCO) rallying on earnings. But once again stocks weakened as the session wore on. The Dow Jones fell below its 50-day line, joining the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Russell 2000.</p>
      <p>Leading stocks suffered more damage, looking bad even when the major indexes were flat. Homebuilders Lennar (LEN), KB Home (KBH) and D.R. Horton (DHI) broke lower.</p>
      <p>Nvidia (NVDA), the stock of the 2023 market rally, largely held its ground as yet another analyst made bullish comments about NVDA stock heading into earnings next week. But almost all other chip stocks are below their 50-day lines. Meanwhile, more-speculative AI plays Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and C3.ai (AI) broke further.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures climbed 0.1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield declined several basis points to 4.25%.</p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin tumbled Thursday night on news that SpaceX has sold all its holdings in the cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>China property giant Evergrande filed for bankruptcy in New York on Thursday night. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 1% intraday Friday.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Earnings</h3>
      <p>AMAT stock rose modestly in late trading after Applied Materials earnings and revenue comfortably beat views. The chip equipment giant also guided higher. AMAT stock edged down 0.5% to 137.59 on Thursday, after falling below its 50-day line recently.</p>
      <p>ROST stock jumped overnight, signaling a breakout, after Ross Stores topped earnings views and guided slightly higher. Shares fell 1.9% to 113.06 on Thursday. Ross Stores stock has been flirting with a 115.48 cup-with-handle buy point.</p>
      <p>Deere, XPeng and Chinese e-commerce play Vipshop (VIPS) are on tap before Friday's open.</p>
      <p>DE stock fell slightly Thursday but found support at its 50-day line. XPEV stock rose Thursday but has pulled back sharply after a huge June-July move. VIPS stock bounced but is below its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) looms Friday night. Earnings reports after the close are highly unusual, and the cybersecurity giant has given no explanation. PANW stock fell Thursday to its worst level since late May.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Thursday</h3>
      <p>The stock market closed near session lows yet again.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index also lost 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite skidded 1.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slumped 1.15%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 5 basis points to 4.31%. Intraday, the yield hit 4.328%, a whisker below the 15-year high of 4.331% set last October. It's already the highest close since November 2007.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices rose 1.3% to $80.39 a barrel, snapping a three-session slide. Copper futures climbed 0.9%.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) slumped 2.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gave up 1.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell 0.7%. AMAT stock is a notable SMH holding, with Nvidia the No. 1 holding.</p>
      <p>Reflecting stocks with more-speculative stories, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) retreated 2.4% and ARK Genomics (ARKG) lost 0.7%.</p>
      <p>The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) edged up 0.2%, while the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) declined 1.5%. U.S. Global Jets (JETS) descended 1.5%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) tumbled 3.6%, with DHI stock and Lennar holdings. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) rose 1.2%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) dropped 0.8%.</p>
      <p>The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) slipped 0.8%, with DE stock a top-10 holding.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dipped 0.5%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was flat.</p>
      <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
      <p>The losses keep piling up for the major indexes and leading stocks. Bulls are no longer putting up much of a fight.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq is 3.5% below its 50-day line, with the 21-day about to cross below the 50-day. The S&P 500 is separating from the 50-day while the Russell 2000 is approaching its 200-day.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones, which looked strong Monday, has dipped below its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq advance/decline line has hit long-term lows. The NYSE A/D line has pulled back, but more modestly.</p>
      <p>Leading stocks do not look good. Some heretofore resilient areas are cracking, like homebuilders. Lennar, D.R. Horton and KBH stock fell 5% to 6% and are now decisively below their 50-day lines.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock lost a fraction Thursday but is still holding the bulk of Monday's big rebound. The ultimate AI stock finished pennies below its 50-day line but is essentially finding support. But that's not enough to prop up the broader market.</p>
      <p>Other AI plays are not holding up. PLTR stock plunged 8.5% and AI stock skidded 5.3%. Both broke below fresh levels after diving through their 50-day lines earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Energy plays are doing well thanks to rising crude prices. Industrials, infrastructure plays and some steel stocks are showing relative strength, even as many pull back modestly.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The stock market has piled losses onto losses. Investors have to take action, paring exposure as recent buys turn into losers and longer holdings slash gains.</p>
      <p>The stock market arguably is due for a rebound. But with the Nasdaq well below its 50-day and Nvidia looming, there's little reason to get excited over one good day.</p>
      <p>Investors may want to use a market bounce as a chance to exit positions.</p>
      <p>Still, when a strong uptrend resumes, many stocks will offer buying opportunities. So you want to be ready. Keep working on watchlists, emphasizing stocks showing relative strength.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell under a key level as Walmart (WMT) reversed lower despite an earnings beat. CVS Health (CVS) cratered after a big insurer tapped rivals including Amazon.com (AMZN) for drugs. Famed fund manager Cathie Wood snapped up shares in a pharma stock despite a big plunge.</p>
    	<p>With the market weakening, now is a good time to bulk up one's watchlist. PDD (PDD), Cinemark (CNK) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) are potential candidates near entries.</p>	
    	<p>Stocks fell after investors digested more economic data. First-time jobless claims fell to 239,000 vs. 248,000 in the previous week, according to the Labor Department. Economists had expected them to fall to 240,000. Ongoing strength in the jobs market bolsters the case of interest rate hawks.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index came in with a 12.0 reading, showing growth. This was much better than the expected -10.0 reading.</p>
      <p>Treasury yields were mixed. The 10-year yield rose 5 basis point to 4.31% while the two-year yield slipped 5 basis point to 4.93%. Dow Jones Market Data says the 10-year yield is at the highest since Nov. 7, 2007, based on 3 p.m. ET yields.</p>
      <h3>Bears Maul Nasdaq, Small Caps</h3>	
      <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at session lows, falling 1.2%. Moderna (MRNA) stood out from the crowd as it turned in a powerful gain of 7.4%.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&P 500 held up slightly better, but still fell 0.8%. Juniper Networks (JNPR) shined here thanks to a lift of 3.1%.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 sectors were almost all negative. Consumer staples and consumer discretionary lagged the most in the stock market today. Energy was the only area to finish in positive territory.</p>
      <p>Small caps were spanked, with the Russell 2000 falling 1.1%. But bears gave growth stocks the worst thrashing, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) diving 2.1%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Walmart Earnings Beat, WMT Reverses</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones closed down 291 points, or 0.8%. There was enough to cause it to end below the 50-day moving average, joining the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 below this key level.</p>
      <p>Walmart was among the worst performers in the Dow despite posting strong earnings and sales results and raising its fiscal-year outlook. The retail giant ended the session down 2.2% after reversing lower. It retreated below the 50-day moving average, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Cisco Systems (CSCO) popped 3.3% after topping views on the top and bottom lines.</p>
      <p>Poor sessions from the likes of Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA) and UnitedHealth (UNH) also dragged. But Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fared worst of all on the index as it skidded 3.7%.</p>
      <h3>Cathie Wood Snaps Up Stock After Dip, Sells Shopify</h3>
    	<p>Big-name investors are often brave enough to buy on the dip. That is certainly the case with Wood, the famed fund manager.</p>
      <p>The ARK Invest CEO was at it again when she snapped up a big chunk of Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Her firm bought almost 220,000 shares for the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG).</p>
      <p>From its July 19 high of 16.75 to today's low of 8.42, its decline was about 50%. The company is unprofitable for now but its shares are in the top 13% of stocks in terms of price performance over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>RXRX stock does seem to be getting support at the 200-day moving average, at least for now.</p>
      <p>Wood also trimmed her holdings of Shopify (SHOP) in her flagship ARK Innovation ETF by just over 182,000 shares Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>CVS Stock Craters On Amazon Move</h3>
      <p>CVS Health was given a painful beatdown on news Blue Shield of California is ending its pharmacy benefits partnership with the firm.</p>
      <p>The insurer is ditching CVS Caremark in favor of Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug as it seeks to save on the cost of pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p>Blue Shield of California CEO Paul Markovich said he believes the firm will "be saving $500 million a year" once the plan comes to fruition.</p>
      <p>But while this may benefit customers, it has proved to be a bitter pill for CVS shareholders. CVS stock ended off lows but still fell 8.1%, gapping below its 50-day moving average. This is a key sell signal for a stock that had barely begun to rebound.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: These Stocks Eye Buy Points</h3>
      <p>With the stock market struggling, it is a good time to add names to your watchlist.</p>
      <p>China e-commerce stock PDD is one to watch for adventurous investors. Shares have formed a cup-with-handle base with a 92.79 buy point.</p>
      <p>PDD stock has been finding support at the 10-week moving average. Overall strong performance is reflected in its IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of 99.</p>
      <p>Cinemark is eying a consolidation pattern entry of 18.85, but has formed a handle with an 18.46 buy point. It is in the top 11% of stocks in terms of price performance over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>The cinema chain has also been seeing rising institutional investment, with its Accumulation/Distribution Rating coming in at B.</p>
      <p>Outsourcing and payroll services play ADP has formed a cup with handle with an entry point of 256.84. The relative strength line is looking bullish. Performance is strong overall, with its IBD Composite Rating coming in at 99.</p>

      <p>Early Thursday, key earnings movers included Walmart (WMT). The retail giant gave up early losses to drop 0.6% after the company reported strong earnings and sales results and raised its fiscal-year outlook.</p>
      <p>Also on the move were StoneCo (STNE), and Dow Jones stock Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco shares rallied nearly 5% in early action, while StoneCo dived 6%.</p>	
    	<h3>Stock Market Today</h3>

      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column as the stock market continues to pull back from this year's highs.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks: Boeing, Visa</h3>

      <p>Oracle continues to trace a flat base with a 127.54 buy point. An early entry at 121.36 is also in play, as the software leader tries to maintain support around the 50-day line. ORCL stock moved up 0.6% early Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>David Rosenberg expects a repeat of last year's sharp decline in stocks as risks mount in markets.</li>
        <li>The economist sees several headwinds including Fitch and Moody's downgrades and Chinese deflation.</li>
        <li>The S&P 500 is way overvalued by historical standards and relative to other assets, Rosenberg says.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Get ready for a repeat of last year's slump in stocks, as investors wake up to the mounting risks in markets today, David Rosenberg has warned.</p>
    	<p>The Rosenberg Research president pointed to deflation in China, the prospect of higher borrowing costs for the US government after Fitch downgraded the country's credit rating, and a looming credit crunch after Moody's cut the credit ratings of several US regional banks. He also singled out the resumption of student-loan payments in September as a likely drag on young Americans' future spending.</p>	
    	<p>"The stock market simply does not understand, or more charitably does not appreciate," those headwinds, Rosenberg said in a video uploaded to his firm's YouTube channel on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"It would be one thing if the S&P 500 was priced for these imperfections, but instead it is priced for perfection," the former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch added.</p>
      <p>Rosenberg explained that the equity-risk premium, or the projected difference in returns from stocks versus safe assets like government bonds, has tumbled to two-decade lows. Moreover, S&P 500 companies' valuations are in the top 9% of expensiveness in the index's history, he said.</p>
      <p>The veteran economist noted his firm's Strategizer tool, which models future returns for different assets and markets, is now showing its lowest score for the S&P 500 since January 2022. He pointed out that the benchmark index slumped nearly 30% during the next nine months last year, as price-to-earnings multiples receded toward historical averages.</p>
      <p>"We should expect a déjà vu, especially with interest rates so much higher than they were back then," Rosenberg said.</p>	
    	<p>Investors should avoid the "uber-expensive" US stock market, and instead buy "undervalued and deeply shorted" US Treasuries, Rosenberg argued. He also touted stocks in Canada and Asia — excluding China given the geopolitical risks of parking money there now —  as well as gold, a traditional haven asset.</p>
      <p>Rosenberg has been pounding the alarm on stocks and economic risks for a while. In a recent research note, he compared the current hype around stocks to the mania that preceded the Great Crash of 1929, the dot-com bubble's implosion in the early 2000s, and the housing market's collapse in 2008.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he warned that American consumers are burning through their savings and racking up credit-card debt as they weather historic inflation and sharply higher interest rates. They're now "at the end of the rope," paving the way for a painful recession, he said.</p>

    	<p>The stock market rally had a mixed week, but the action was generally negative, with resurgent Treasury yields and mixed earnings weighing on growth.</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq fell through the 50-day and 10-week moving averages last week. Tesla stock and Nvidia (NVDA) are decisively below their 10-week lines. Nvidia stock's decline is especially important as it's the leader of the AI-led market rally.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 edged lower, but found support around its 10-week line Friday. The Dow Jones rose slightly for the week.</p>
      <p>The market rally is in danger of falling into a correction. While techs arguably already are in a correction, industrials, infrastructure, housing and energy sectors are holding up or gaining ground. So are some retail, travel, medical, transportation and financial names.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield held at 4.17%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures fell 1%. Copper prices edged lower.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.6% as property sector woes continued.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stocks Near Buy Points</h3>
      <p>Arista Networks (ANET), Tenaris (TS), Visa (V), SLB (SLB), Lennar (LEN), Martin Marietta (MLM), Delta Air Lines (DAL), Flowserve (FLS), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are all setting up or holding up.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cardinal Health (CAH), Cava Group (CAVA), Home Depot (HD), StoneCo (STNE) and On Holding (ONON) are trading around buy zones with earnings due this coming week.</p>
      <p>Still, investors should be thinking defensively in the current market environment.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock, Nvidia and Martin Marietta are on IBD Leaderboard. SLB stock is on SwingTrader. Tesla, SLB, Applied Materials and ANET stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20. Flowserve was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article discussed the weekly market action in depth, while also analyzing Flowserve, JPM stock and Nvidia.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Cuts Model Y China Prices</h3>
      <p>The EV giant cut China prices of the Model Y Long Range and Performance variants by RMB14,000 ($1,930), adding to pressure on Tesla margins. The Model Y faces several new crossover rivals in China. The base Model Y, the most popular variant in China, was left unchanged.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tesla is offering an insurance subsidy of RMB 8,000 for Model 3 buyers. It may be trying to clear out inventory. An updated Tesla Model 3 reportedly is imminent in China.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>TSLA stock fell more than 2% early Monday, signaling a two-month low.</p>
      <p>Last week, Tesla stock declined 4.4% to 242.65. Shares fell below their 50-day line on Monday and then kept losing ground. TSLA stock is now 6.7% below its 10-week line. Finishing the week more than 2% below the 10-week is a significant sell signal. Recent buyers should likely get out.</p>
      <p>Those with big cushions can consider taking partial profits depending on your investing strategy and conviction in the stock.</p>
      <h3>U.S. Steel Rejects Takeover Bid, But...</h3>
      <p>Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) offered $17.50 a share plus 1.02 CLF shares for each U.S. Steel (X) share, worth $32.53 a share as of Friday's close. U.S. Steel rejected the deal, Cleveland-Cliffs said Sunday. Earlier Sunday, U.S. Steel said it was mulling strategic options after "receiving multiple unsolicited proposals." Options include the sale of key assets or even the entire company.</p>
      <p>U.S. Steel stock soared more than 25% early Monday. CLF stock reversed slightly higher.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally had a mixed week that was damaging for the Nasdaq and growth names.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite slumped 1.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1.65%.</p>
      <p>Market breadth is weakening on the Nasdaq, but much less so on the NYSE.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 11 basis points to 4.17%, close to the 2023 high of 4.21% set Aug. 4. The yield rocketed from a Thursday morning low of 3.96%.</p>
      <p>With Treasury yields rising and overseas economies ailing, the U.S. dollar is coming up to 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures climbed 0.45% to $83.19 a barrel, the seventh straight weekly gain. But copper prices fell 3.4%, and it's off 5.2% in two weeks.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) tumbled 4.9% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slid 1.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) plunged 5.2%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 SMH holding.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) gave up 5.8% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) sold off 6.15%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
      <p>The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) slipped 1.4% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) edged up 0.2%, with MLM stock a holding.</p>
      <p>U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) edged down 0.5%, with DAL stock a notable component. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) dipped 0.7%, with LEN stock a member.</p>
      <p>The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) popped 3.5%. SLB is one of the top XLE components. and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) rose 2.45%, with CAH stock advancing. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) nudged 0.6% higher.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose a fraction, with Dow Jones giants Visa and JPM stock both notable holding. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 1.65%.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Stock</h3>
      <p>Nvidia fell below its 50-day line on Wednesday, reversed lower on Thursday and extended losses Friday. Shares finished down 8.6% to 408.55, their worst weekly decline of the year, and in higher volume. NVDA stock is now 5.1% below its 10-week line. Recent investors likely should be out.</p>
      <p>Longer-term investors could take profits or not. If you're going to hold a winner for its big run, you're going to have to sit through corrections. Nvidia is the leading stock of the AI-led rally, but are you willing to sit through the downturn?</p>
      <p>Also note: Nvidia earnings are due on Aug. 23.</p>
      <p>The overall chip sector is falling back, with fellow leaders such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) tumbling below the 50-day line this past week. More broadly, AI plays had a tough week.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally is on the verge of a correction.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq fell through its 50-day and 10-week lines on Wednesday, and those are now starting to separate. But it's not decisively below those levels.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 touched its 10-week line on Friday, but is holding that for now. The Russell 2000 nearly touched its 10-week. Both have hit resistance at the 21-day line.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones is holding its 21-day.</p>
      <p>Many growth leaders are decisively below the 10-week line, with Tesla and Nvidia stock just two notable names. A large number of tech plays suffered huge losses in the past couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the S&P 500 is holding the 50-day line, even with tech losses. Many sectors look fine, with Visa, SLB, JPMorgan, Flowserve and Lululemon among the names in those fields. That could continue even if the market enters a mild correction. But most aren't really booming either.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>Investors should be increasingly defensive, especially with regards to growth plays. Overall and tech exposure should have been coming down in the past couple of weeks, even if only by addressing holdings on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>You can still make buys outside of tech, but those areas are generally holding up or giving ground grudgingly vs. making real advances. One exception is the energy sector, fueled by weeks of higher oil prices. SLB stock is among the few names noted in this article that is actually in a buy zone.</p>
      <p>It's still possible that the market rally revives, especially if Treasury yields ease.</p>
      <p>The ongoing pullback is letting leading stocks pull back to key levels and work on new bases. So a slew of buying opportunities could develop, whether that's in a few days or several weeks.</p>
      <p>Investors need to prepare for that moment. Build up those watchlists, keeping an eye on stocks showing strong relative strength.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets tumbled Monday after mixed U.S. economic data revived worries the Federal Reserve might hike interest rates again.</p>
	    <p>Hong Kong's main market index plunged 2.3% and Shanghai, Tokyo and Sydney also fell. Oil prices retreated.</p>	
	    <p>Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index slipped 0.1% on Friday after government data showed producer price inflation accelerated in July. Earlier data showed consumer prices also rose faster in July.</p>
      <p>“Setbacks to optimistic expectations are hard to ignore,” said Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in a report. “The data need to provide reasons” for the Federal Reserve "not to hike.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.1% to 3,154.16 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo shed 1% to 32,160.30. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank to 18,629.82.</p>
      <p>The Kospi in South Korea retreated 1% to 2,565.37 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was 0.8% lower at 7,283.60.</p>
      <p>New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also declined.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell to 4,464.05 on Friday after the Labor Department's producer price index rose 0.8% over a year earlier, accelerating from June's 0.2% rate. The index fell 0.3% for the week, its second consecutive weekly decline.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq composite fell 0.7% to 13,644.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3% to 35,281.40.</p>
      <p>The price data clashed with investor hopes the Fed will decide inflation is under control following a year of rapid rate hikes to cool economic activity and no more increases are needed.</p>
      <p>The majority of Wall Street traders still bet the central bank will make no change to the fed funds rate at its September meeting, according to data from CME Group. Such hopes helped the S&P 500 rally 19.5% in the first seven months of this year.</p>
      <p>Critics warn Wall Street too quickly formed a consensus that inflation is under control, the economy will avoid a recession and the Fed has ended its rate hike cycle.</p>
      <p>Earlier, government data showed U.S. consumer inflation accelerated to 3.2% in July from the previous month's 3%. That is down from last year's peak above 9% but still higher than the Fed's 2% target.</p>
      <p>Bond yields rose, including the two-year Treasury yield, which climbed to 4.89%. The yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, had been at 4.80% right before the report’s release. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.10% late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.</p>
      <p>Fed officials say rate decisions will depend on hiring, inflation and other data.</p>	
	    <p>Major U.S. retailers are set to report quarterly results this week, including Home Depot on Tuesday, Target on Wednesday and Walmart on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude lost 72 cents to $82.47 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 37 cents on Friday to $83.19. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, fell 76 cents to $86.05 per barrel in London. It advanced 41 cents on Friday to $86.81 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The dollar fell to 144.93 yen from Friday's 144.97 yen. The euro fell to $1.0933 from $1.0951.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>But, when it comes to the best of breed outlier companies, earnings follow superstar stocks. And you can spot them following institutional demand.</p>
    	<h3>Earnings Follow Superstar Stocks</h3>
      <p>Let’s start with the market first. Below shows how the price of the S&P 500 plots a strong correlation to its trailing 12-month EPS since 2012.</p>	
    	<p>Understanding the overall earnings picture will give you an edge. But when it comes to the best stocks out there, the stock often moves prior to exploding earnings.</p>	
    	<p>Take NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) as an example. Below plots the stock price since 2012 overlaid against its 12-month trailing EPS. Notice 3 periods when the stock rallied well ahead of the earnings pop:</p>
      <p>Circled first, NVDA started jumping in 2015, when trailing earnings were .28 per share. Fast forward to January 2019, EPS rallied to $1.87.</p>
      <p>Observing the 2nd green circle, the stock started juicing in the 2nd half of 2019 when trailing EPS was at a low of $1.11. Fast forward to April 2022, EPS ballooned to $3.85.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at another recent example, Super Micro Computer (SMCI).</p>
      <p>Below plots the stock price overlaid against earnings since 2012. Notice last summer, the stock began to explode higher in the middle of the bear market!</p>
      <p>Shares and earnings were muted for years. Then in June 2022, the stock began to march higher. Back then, the 12-month trailing EPS sat at $3.44, ballooning to $10.61 by August 2023.</p>
      <p>This proves once again how earnings follow superstar stocks.</p>
      <p>So, what can investors do to catch these trending stocks early? Follow the Big Money. MAPsignals is all about finding the best stocks under institutional accumulation.</p>
      <p>Below plots NVIDIA each time it was profiled in our research. This blue signal is made up of 2 drivers: institutional buy pressure and healthy fundamentals like earnings growth.</p>
      <p>Below I’ve noted the 3 circles for NVDA:</p>
      <p>Next, here’s SMCI footprints. Again, blue bars appeared last summer as earnings were set to explode:</p>
      <p>Please note, this buying began right in the teeth of a nasty bear market. That’s the power of Big Money analysis.</p>
      <p>In general, stocks follow earnings. The relationship is undeniable. But, the bigger prize is in spotting outlier stocks which are on professional investors’ radar.</p>
      <p>Disclosure: As of the time of this writing, the author holds no positions in NVDA or SMCI.</p>

    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed near session lows after ceding ground early as Walt Disney (DIS) jumped following its report. Famed fund manager Cathie Wood loaded up on Roblox (RBLX) despite a huge plunge for the stock. China stock Alibaba (BABA) vaulted after earnings.</p>
    	<p>Meanwhile, a couple of stocks attempted breakouts amid the buoyant early action. But Expro Group (XPRO) and Progress Software (PRGS) had mixed luck after moving above entries.</p>	
    	<p>Stocks initially jumped after data showed consumer prices in July rose 3.2% vs. July 2022, cooler than economists consensus view for a 3.3% lift. The rise of 0.2% from June was in line with expectations. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, were up 4.8% year over year and 0.2% from June. This met expectations. Investors are hoping falling inflation will cause the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive on interest rates.</p>	
    	<p>"Stocks pared gains after summer doldrums settled in and the buying dried up," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told IBD. "The S&P 500 is at some key technical levels and it seems buyers are not willing to try to push it higher."</p>
      <p>Treasury yields rose. The 10-year yield jumped 10 basis point to 4.11% while the two-year yield rose 5 basis point to 4.85%. The yield curve remains inverted.</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq Gains Vanish As Small Caps Slide</h3>
      <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw almost all of its early gains disappear as it closed 0.1% higher. MercadoLibre (MELI) was a top performer here, rising 5.7% and clearing a cup base buy point of 1,365.64.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&P 500 fared even worse, closing virtually flat. Tapestry (TPR) stood out here for the wrong reasons, plunging 15.9% on the news it plans to buy rival Capri Holdings (CPRI) for $8.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 sectors ended the session mixed. Communication services and consumer discretionary fared best in the stock market today. Utilities and real estate lagged the most.</p>
      <p>The bears nibbled at small caps, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.4%. Growth stocks were also mauled, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) closing the day down 0.8%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Disney Stock Pops After Earnings</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones flirted with negative territory. It ended the session with a meager gain of 53 points, a 0.2% gain.</p>
      <p>Disney was the top performer on the Dow Jones today, popping despite posting mixed results late Wednesday. While it is struggling with slowing streaming growth and high content costs, Wall Street cheered its second set of major price increases in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Among those hikes were more than 20% increases to the cost of the ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu. The cost of the ad-supported versions will not change. Disney Parks, Experiences and Products revenue jumped 13% over the year to $8.33 billion.</p>
      <p>But while Disney stock gained 4.9%, its lift year to date of just over 3% badly lags the benchmark S&P 500's gain of nearly 17%. Disney gapped up through its 50-day moving average. But with the stock still below its 200-day line, this would be a very aggressive entry point.</p>
      <p>Intel (INTC) and Salesforce (CRM) were the next best performers on the Dow Jones, with gains of 1.2% each. Goldman Sachs (GS) lagged as it skidded 0.7% and sank further below the 200-day line.</p>
      <h3>Cathie Wood Loads Up On Roblox Stock After Plunge</h3>
      <p>Fund manager Wood is never afraid to buy on the dip. Some would say the ARK Invest CEO outdid herself after loading up on Roblox stock Wednesday.</p>
      <p>At its lows for that session, Roblox lost 23% on the previous day's closing price. It was hammered after missing analyst views for both earnings and revenue.</p>
      <p>A silver lining for bulls is that daily active users rocketed 25% year over year.</p>
      <p>She snapped up just under 664,000 shares for her ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), almost 122,000 for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and just under 80,000 for the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF).</p>
      <p>And Cathie Wood is not the only fan of Roblox stock. Wedbush analyst Nick McKay upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral. He has set a price target of 37. In a research note he said the stock "may have the most compelling growth trajectory among the video game names in our coverage universe."</p>
      <p>Roblox stock rallied 3.9% Thursday but remains firmly rooted below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
      <h3>Alibaba Earnings Boost China Stocks</h3>
      <p>China e-commerce play Alibaba had a strong session after it posted solid results.</p>
      <p>The firm managed to beat analysts expectations on the top and bottom lines. A 14% pop in revenue was its best year-over-year sales growth since 2021. Management also touted its efforts in artificial intelligence, telling analysts "the growth opportunity driven by AI services has just begun."</p>
      <p>Alibaba stock finished the session up 4.6% and sits above both its major and its short-term moving averages.</p>
      <p>Other China stocks also rose. Vipshop (VIPS) rose 0.4% while Baidu (BIDU) lifted 0.6%, Tencent (TCEHY) rose 0.6% while Warren Buffett-Backed BYD (BYDDF) rose 0.9%.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: These Stocks Test Buy Points</h3>
      <p>Even with the current stock market uptrend under pressure, it is important to keep an eye on breakouts.</p>
      <p>Oil well construction play Expro Group ended the day in a buy zone after clearing a cup-with-handle entry of 23.72.</p>
      <p>Overall stellar performance has netted it an IBD Composite Rating of 97. It is currently in the top 6% of stocks in terms of price performance over the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Progress Software had less luck, reversing back under its buy zone after testing a cup-base entry of 61.79. The database software play boasts strong earnings and stock market performance but has been struggling to move decisively higher of late.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 and stocks across Europe built on gains from the day before on Thursday, in spite of evident pain in the UK housing market and fresh data showing inflation is creeping up in the US.</p>
    	<p>The US Consumer Price Inflation reading for July hit analysts expectations of 0.2%, and matched the previous month's reading. Year-on-year CPI for the US hit 3.2%, up from 3% the month before.</p>	
    	<p>Markets will be looking to reads on inflation such as the CPI as a guide on how the Federal Reserve might adjust interest rates in future meetings.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was 0.5% higher by the close in London. Meanwhile, the Dow (^DJI) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) gained 0.6% respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, UK housing market data from RICS released Thursday morning showed more signs of a slowdown in property in the UK, as agreed sales fell to -44% in July, down from -36% the previous month.</p>
      <p>The pressure of high interest rates has choked both buyer demand and mortgage applications meaning that price declines reached levels last seen in 2009.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was up 0.4% by the end of the day, while the DAX (^GDAXI) in Germany had risen 1% and Paris's CAC (^FCHI) moved 1.6% higher.</p>
      <h3>LIVE UPDATES</h3>
      <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets is noting that the FTSE 100 is underpoerforming today due to "over 10% of the index going ex-dividend, including the likes of AstraZeneca, Rio Tinto, Shell, NatWest, Barclays, BP, and HSBC, which has served to knock over 30 points off the index."</p>
      <p>"The announcement by China to end its ban on overseas travel groups to other countries has also helped boost travel, leisure, and the luxury sector, especially the CAC 40, with LVMH, Hermes, and Kering, getting a lift along with Burberry in the UK," he added.</p>
      <p>Some more commentary from Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management:</p>
      <p><strong>A building trend of disinflation will certainly be welcomed by the Fed as they prepare for a policy decision at the September meeting. Within the data, shelter costs continued to be a driving factor for inflation, while price declines were seen in the goods sector and in particular used vehicles. Overall, the case continues to build for the Fed to done with the hiking cycle as real yields are well into positive territory and progress on bringing down inflation is evident.</strong></p>
      <p>Tamara Charm, partner at McKinsey & Company comments on US inflation figures:</p>
      <p><strong>We’re seeing consumers are of two minds. Despite the fact that most Americans have more money now than they did pre-pandemic, consumers are still more cautious with their spend than last year. At the same time, according to The University of Michigan, consumer sentiment continues to recover.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Consumers are continuing to trade down, yet they are also splurging on those things that feel more important in the moment. This is true across income levels and demographics, with higher earners trading down from their usual spending habits as well. At the same time, consumers are excited to be out and about again and splurging in certain areas including travel and entertainment. Higher income Gen Z and millennials are especially excited to splurge.</strong></p>
      <p>LaToya points out that Disney will be one to watch at the open in the US with shares up around 1.7% premarket.</p>
      <p>It said it is raising prices for its streaming service by more than a quarter.</p>
      <p>From October, the US entertainment firm will hike the monthly cost of Disney+ to $13.99 (£11) per month, a 27% increase.</p>
      <p>It is also planning to roll out its ad-supported subscription tier internationally, starting at £4.99 in the UK, as chief executive Bob Iger looks to increase profitability.</p>
      <p>Traditional TV continued to struggle during the period, with revenues down 7% and profits falling 23%.</p>
      <p>Disney+ saw a 7.4% decline in subscribers to 146.1 million, yet The Walt Disney Company reported a 4% rise in revenues to $22.3bn compared to the same period in 2022.</p>
      <p>Alongside gloom from RICS today, a shocking stat has come through from Hilltop Credit Partners:</p>
      <p>-- UK rents rose at +3.8% in the 3 months to June and are currently +10.4% above year-ago levels and 29% above pre-pandemic levels.</p>
      <p>Latest figures from Ireland shows the pace of consumer price inflation slowing. Prices rose by 5.8% between July 2022 and July 2023, down from an annual increase of 6.1% in the 12 months to June 2023.</p>
      <p>Even with the decrease, this is the twenty second straight month where the annual increase in the CPI has been at least 5.0%.</p>
      <p>Education (-6.3%) and Transport (-4.5%) were the only divisions to show a decrease when compared with July 2022.</p>
      <h3>Top movers in the FTSE today are:</h3>
      <p>Spirax-Sarco Engineering (SPX.L) ⬇️ 5.6%</p>
      <p>Persimmon (PSN.L) ⬆️ 3.5%</p>
      <p>Rio Tinto (RIO.L) ⬇️ 3.2%</p>
      <p>Prudential (PRU.L) ⬆️ 2.6%</p>
      <p>Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG.L) ⬆️ 2.5%</p>
      <p><strong>BREAKING: </strong>Wilco bosses say the chain has collapsed as rescue talks have failed, leaving 12,000 jobs on the line.</p>
      <p>Mark Jackson said that Wilco "must concede that with regret, we've no choice but to take the difficult decision to enter into administration."</p>
      <p>Bloomberg is reporting that low-cost retailer Wilko is teetering on the brink of insolvency, with proceedings to begin as soon as this morning.</p>
      <p>The company has roughly 400 stores and employs 12,000 people.</p>
      <p>After a review of fund managers, the FCA has found that some businesses "require improvement" on best practices.</p>
      <p>Here's what the regulator said:</p>
      <p><strong>Today’s findings show that many firms have now fully integrated considerations on assessment of value into their product development and fund governance processes. This greater focus has also driven changes in fees and charges, resulting in savings of costs to consumers amounting to millions of pounds.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>However, there remain outliers, where action needs to be taken. This is particularly important with the Consumer Duty which came into force on 31 July, where firms are expected to deliver fair value for retail consumers.</strong></p>
      <p>Following the RICS numbers housebuilder Persimmon (PSN.L) echoed the mood music.</p>
      <p>It said it completed 4,249 homes in the first half of 2023, down from 6,652 in January-June 2022.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, pre-tax profits dropped to £151m, down from £439.7m a year ago, even though average prices rose to £256,445 from £245,597. Profit margins shrunk, as costs rose.</p>
      <p>Despite the souring numbers, its stock was up 1.3% in early trade in London.</p>
      <h3>Overnight in the US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Despite a cheery mood in Europe on Wednesday, major stock indexes in the US closed in the red overnight.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 0.7%, the Dow (^DJI) pulled back 0.5% and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 1.2% lower.</p>
      <p>Traders are practising some cation ahead of the US CPI reading, which analysts think could indicate more difficult times ahead for the economy.</p>
      <p>"Today’s number is expected to show us that it is not possible for inflation numbers to continue to move in a straight line," said Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets. "In fact, the number is likely to show us today that the journey for the inflation number from here onwards is going to be a lot more difficult than previously anticipated, and there are a number of important factors behind this, such as soaring oil prices."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile it was a broadly positive day in Asia on Thursday, with the Nikkei (^N225) up 0.8% by close, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) finishing almost flat and Shanghai's Composite index (000001.SS) rising 0.3% in the session.</p>
      <p>Indexes have done well to recover from jitters about China's growth rate amid declines in factory activity and a year-on-year decline in consumer prices.</p>
      <p>Good morning! It's another beautiful day in London. Markets look set to open in the green. Let's get to it.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>European stock markets were in negative territory on Tuesday as UK retail data showed that like-for-like sales slowed during July, rising 1.8% but well below the three-month average of 3.3%.</p>
    	<p>In London, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) fell 0.5% by afternoon trade, also knocked by weaker-than-expected trade data from China, while the CAC (^FCHI) also lost 1% in Paris, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) was 1.2% lower.</p>	
    	<p>Across the pond, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 1.2% lower at the opening bell. The Dow Jones (^DJI) also slipped 1.2%.</p>	
    	<p>The British Retail Consortium (BRC) revealed that food sales performed particularly well during the period, but at the expense of online sales of non-food items like clothes which showed a sharp slowdown.</p>
      <p>"It is clear that consumers are spending their money much more carefully and spending only when necessary, as Bank of England rate hikes continue to bite on incomes," Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said.</p>
      <p>"With some consumers approaching a cliff edge as their fixed rate terms come up for expiry, they may well be saving more in order to mitigate the impact of an impending sharp rise in mortgage costs."</p>
      <p>A separate survey from Barclaycard showed that spending on entertainment saw a boost of 15.8% even as clothing sales declined. Bars, pubs, and clubs saw a pickup in spending as did the concerts and movies.</p>
      <p>Hewson added: "Bars, pubs, and clubs saw a pickup in spending as did the entertainment sector as Taylor Swift did for July, what Beyoncé did for May.</p>
      <p>"The release of a big slate of summer films may also have offered a boost with the latest Indiana Jones film, along with Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning, Barbie and Oppenheimer prompting people to venture out given the wetter weather during the month."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, exports in China during July suffered a bigger than expected decline of 14.5%. This was worst performance since February 2020, with global demand remaining weak.</p>
      <p>Imports saw a decline of 12.4%, an even worse performance from June’s 6.8%, with all sectors of the economy showing weakness.</p>
      <h3>Blog close and recap</h3>
      <p>Well that's all we have time for today - thanks for following along. Be sure to join us again tomorrow bright and early.</p>
      <p>Here's a quick summary of the main headlines from today:</p>
      <p>China's trade slumps in July</p>
      <p>Investors lose taste for Beyond Meat</p>
      <p>Italy approves 40% windfall tax on banks</p>
      <p>Abrdn falls to bottom of FTSE</p>
      <p>US trade deficit shrinks by more than 4%</p>
      <h3>Pound and oil update</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) is down against the US dollar by 0.6% to 1.2702. Against the euro, sterling (GBPEUR=X) is 0.1% lower to 1.1612.</p>
      <p>In commodities, oil prices are on a downward trajectory.</p>
      <p>US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), has lost 1.1% to trade at $81.03 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) fell 1.2% to $84.40.</p>
      <p>George Pavel, general manager at Capex.com, said:</p>
      <p><strong>"Oil prices came under pressure after Chinese economic data demonstrated a faster-than-expected decline in exports and imports. This data comes on top of an already weaker-than-expected recovery in China. The data directed traders’ concerns to oil demand levels once again as China sees declining oil imports.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>"Overall, crude has been accumulating gains for more than a month. Prices have been recovering due to the expectations of tighter supply as Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their production cuts to include September. Both countries remained open to increasing the size of their production cuts if necessary to support the market.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>"Otherwise, rising tensions in the black sea could affect Russia’s ability to deliver part of its oil production to its remaining trade partners. Renewed issues on this supply route could add to the concerns around available volumes on the market and could contribute to support prices."</strong></p>
      <h3>Tenants more likely to receive support from younger landlords</h3>
      <p>Over half (57%) of landlords aged between 18 and 24 would provide support to tenants during the cost-of-living crisis if asked, it has been revealed.</p>
      <p>However, only just over a fifth of all tenants (21%) believe their landlords would definitely support them if approached</p>
      <p>Landlords who answered ‘yes’ to providing support if asked, decreased with each age group, down to 40% at 55+</p>
      <p>More than half of all landlords (51%), and over two thirds of tenants (68%), believe communication is the most important factor in a landlord-tenant relationship.</p>
      <h3>Wall Street falls after opening</h3>
      <p>US stocks have opened lower after Moody’s cut credit ratings of several small- to mid-sized American banks.</p>
      <p>The ratings agency downgraded 10 of the country’s biggest lenders, sparking concern about the financial health of the world’s largest economy.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)fell 0.4% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened 0.5% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped 0.9%</p>
      <h3>US trade deficit shrinks by more than 4%</h3>
      <p>US trade deficit has shrunk by over 4%, it has been revealed.</p>
      <p>America’s goods and services deficit was $65.5bn in June, down $2.8bn from the $68.3bn recorded in May.</p>
      <p>Imports fell by 1% to $313bn, including a $2.3bn decrease in shipments of heavy-duty capital goods into the US.</p>
      <p>Exports were 0.1% down at $247.5bn, partly due to a £500m drop in the value of crude oil shipments.</p>
      <h3>NIESR key points:</h3>
      <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) held a press conference today. Here are the key points from the meeting:</p>
      <h3>Wider economy</h3>
      <p>*Inflation has peaked in the advanced economies</p>
      <p>*It expects a relatively quick return to target rates</p>
      <p>*GDP growth expected to be weak this year and next</p>
      <p>*...and likely to remain low relative to the recent past</p>
      <h3>UK economy</h3>
      <p>*Projection of the UK Bank Rate is below market curve at a 5.50% peak</p>
      <p>*Forecasts GDP growth in this year and next of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively</p>
      <p>* Unemployment rate expected to by 4.1% in 2023, 4.7% in 2024, and peaking at 5.1% in 2025.</p>
      <p>*It expects wage growth to remain above 6% in 2023 and 2024.</p>
      <h3>Glencore sees profit fall and cuts shareholder returns</h3>
      <p>Glencore (GLEN.L) slumped as much as 4% in London on Tuesday after it reported a sharp fall in first-half profit and cut returns to its shareholders.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland-based mining firm blamed a decline in the price of coal, which has plunged 69% since September last year, as well as disappointing growth in China. It is now seeking to increase the supply of key materials, such as copper, cobalt, and nickel.</p>
      <p>First-half core earnings came in at $9.4bn (£7.4bn), half the record number it posted last year when Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring. It was also 15% below analyst consensus.</p>
      <p>Glencore added that it would top up its dividend by $1bn and buy back a further $1.2bn of its own stock — also sharply lower than a year earlier, in part because the company is holding back $2bn in cash while it bids to buy Teck Resources’s (TECK-A.TO) coal business.</p>
      <h3>Abrdn falls to bottom of FTSE</h3>
      <p>Abrdn (ABDN.L) tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) after it reported a drop in its assets under management thanks to clients pulling money from its funds amid volatile markets. The stock is currently 10% lower on the day.</p>
      <p>Assets dropped to £495.7bn from £500bn at the end of 2022, while net outflows came in at £5.2bn in the first half of the year, compared to an average £3.1bn forecast by analysts.</p>
      <p>Analysts on average also expected AUMA of £500bn for the period, according to company-compiled estimates.</p>
      <p>The asset manager raised its share buyback plan to £300m from £150m announced in June.</p>
      <p>Adjusted operating profit for the first half rose 10% to £127m as the company reined in costs, however, it still missed analysts' estimate of a profit of £133m.</p>
      <p><strong>Stephen Bird, chief executive, said: "The business has been reshaped to deliver greater resilience, while getting set to take advantage of fast moving sectoral and macroeconomic factors.</strong></p>
      <p>"There is still work to do to complete our transformation."</p>
      <h3>NS&I: Premium Bonds winning odds increase</h3>
      <p>NS&I has said that there will be 5,785,904 prizes up for grabs from September — an increase of more than 269,000 when compared with August 2023.</p>
      <p>This improves the odds of winning to 21,000 to one, from 22,000 to one previously — their best level since the April 2008 prize draw.</p>
      <p>The estimated number of £1m prizes in September will remain the same, at two, but will be around 90 £100,000 prizes, up from an estimated 77 in August.</p>
      <p>There will also be an estimated 181 £50,000 prizes, up from 154 in August.</p>
      <p>While there will be more big money prizes on offer, the estimated number of £25 prizes will reduce, to 1,027,604 in September, down from 1,700,728 in August.</p>
      <p>The prize fund rate will increase from from 4.00% to 4.65% from the September draw, marking its highest level since March 1999.</p>
      <p>The change in odds will see an estimated extra £66m added to the prize fund next month, with a potential prize pot of more than £470m.</p>
      <h3>JP Morgan's Chase UK chief executive exits</h3>
      <p>The CEO of JP Morgan’s online-only retail bank, Chase UK, has resigned.</p>
      <p>An internal memo said:</p>
      <p><strong>We will continue on this journey together, but we will need to do so without Sanjiv Somani, who is leaving the firm and will pursue opportunities outside of JPMorgan Chase.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>I want to thank Sanjiv for leading ICB in the UK, and for his considerable contribution to building and launching the business that we have today. I will immediately reassume the day-to-day leadership of our UK business to ensure seamless continuity in the execution of our plans.”</strong></p>
      <h3>Property: How to give your home a summer MOT</h3>
      <p>Regular maintenance is essential to keep your home running smoothly and help to avoid major repairs — and hefty bills — further down the line.</p>
      <p>It can be a good idea to tackle these tasks now, before colder weather sets in.</p>
      <p>It comes as Moneyfacts has reported that:</p>
      <p>The average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 6.84%, unchanged from Monday</p>
      <p>The average five-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 6.35%, also unchanged from Monday.</p>
      <p>Three more residential mortgage products have come onto the market today, lifting the total available to 5,106.</p>
      <h3>Italian banks slide</h3>
      <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says:</p>
      <p><strong>Italian banks such as Intesa Sanpaolo, BPER Banca and Unicredit are falling particularly sharply after the government approved a 40% windfall tax on banks for 2023.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Banks have enjoyed a major tailwind from rising interest rates with the government looking to redistribute those earnings towards those who are struggling with expensive mortgage payments.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Euro Stoxx banks index is on track for its worst session since March.</strong></p>
      <h3>Italy approves 40% windfall tax on banks</h3>
      <p>Italy has hit banks with a one-off 40% windfall tax for 2023 as it plans to use proceeds to help mortgage holders.</p>
      <p>The move, which has already been imposed in countries such as Spain and Hungary, has sent banking shares plunging.</p>
      <p>Rome expects to collect less than €3bn (£2.58bn, $3.29bn) from the measure, sources close to the matter told Reuters. However, some analysts' estimates were higher.</p>
      <h3>Investors lose taste for Beyond Meat</h3>
      <p>Shares in Beyond Meat (BYND) have slumped as much as 14% in pre-market trading on Tuesday after it lowered its profit forecast for the year amid “softer demand in the plant-based meat category”.</p>
      <p>The supplier of McDonald’s McPlant burger said net revenues slumped by nearly a third (30.5%) in the three months to the end of June, as shoppers turned to cheaper animal meat.</p>
      <p>It added that it now expects annual revenue of between $360m (£282m) to $380m, down from earlier estimates of as much as $415m.</p>
      <h3>China's trade slumps in July</h3>
      <p>The latest China trade numbers for July continued to point to weak economic activity and subdued domestic demand.</p>
      <p>The last two months of Q2 saw sharp declines in exports, with a 12.4% fall in June, while July numbers suffered a bigger than expected decline of 14.5%. This was the worst performance since February 2020, with global demand remaining weak.</p>
      <p>Imports during July saw a decline of 12.4%, an even worse performance from June’s 6.8%, with all sectors of the economy showing weakness.</p>
      <p>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said:</p>
      <p><strong>With numbers this poor it surely can’t be too long before Chinese policymakers take further steps to support their economy with further easing measures, however, there appears to be some reluctance to do so at any scale for the moment, due to concerns over capital outflows.</strong></p>
      <h3>Wall Street and Asia</h3>
      <p>Asian shares closed mostly lower last night as investors digested weaker Chinese trade data ahead of key inflation readings from China and the United States due later this week.</p>
      <p>The Hang Seng (^HSI) slumped 1.9% in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) dropped 0.3% on the day. In Japan, the Nikkei (^N225) managed to outperform, climbing 0.4% during the session.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, US stocks ended with mild gains after their worst weekly decline since March last week.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.9%, recovering more than a third of losses last week, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.6% lower at the close. The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 1.2%.</p>
      <p>The US dollar also pushed higher and the benchmark yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced eight basis points to 4.11%.</p>
      <p>This followed comments from a Federal Reserve official signalling that interest rates could remain higher for longer to tame inflation pressures.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3> 
    	<p>Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.</p>
    	<p>The stock market rally came under pressure last week, with the Nasdaq leading a sell-off as Treasury yields jumped to 2023. The major indexes tried to rebound Friday as yields fell back, but stocks reversed lower.</p>	
    	<p>The market rally could be at an inflection point, for good or ill. With the uptrend "under pressure," investors should be cautious about new buys. But it is an excellent time to be looking for promising stocks.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia (NVDA) is bouncing from a near-test of its 10-week line. Tesla (TSLA) is holding its 50-day and 10-week lines, with multiple possible entries. Broadcom (AVGO) is trading tightly. Toll Brothers (TOL) is rebounding from its 10-week line while Delta Air Lines (DAL) is trying to do so.</p>
      <p>Earnings season has gone through its busiest two weeks, but hundreds of companies will be reporting this coming week.</p>
      <h3>Berkshire Earnings</h3>
    	<p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) reported a 7% gain in operating profit Saturday morning, with with revenue up 21% to $92.5 billion. Analysts expected Berkshire earnings to fall 8% vs. a year earlier to $3.87 a share, with revenue up nearly 6% to $80.58 billion.</p>	
    	<p>Berkshire stock buybacks slowed to $1.4 billion in Q2 vs. $4.4 billion in Q1. The conglomerate's cash pile jumped to $147.38 billion  from Q1's $130.62 billion.</p>	
    	<p>Warren Buffett sold a net $7.98 billion worth of stocks. In Q1, Berkshire sold a net $10.4 billion worth of stocks.</p>
      <p>BRKB stock is slightly extended from a buy point.</p>
    	<p>Apple (AAPL) accounts for nearly half of Berkshire's equity portfolio. Apple stock is up 40% in 2023, though it fell sharply last week, breaking key levels Friday on lackluster earnings and guidance.</p>	
    	<p>Palantir Technologies (PLTR) reports Monday night, with Eli Lilly (LLY) and Celsius Holdings (CELH) on Tuesday.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia stock, Tesla and Celsius are on IBD Leaderboard. TSLA stock is on the IBD 50. The video embedded in this article discusses the market action in depth, while also analyzing AVGO stock, Delta Air Lines and Toll Brothers.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET Sunday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.</p>
    	<p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>	
    	<p>The stock market rally saw solid losses this past week. A Friday bounce turned into a downside reversal, even as Treasury yields came well off highs. It's not clear what drove the afternoon selling. There was a report of a major cyberattack.</p>	
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 1.1% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index slumped 2.3%. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.85%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1.15%.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq regained their 21-day moving averages intraday Friday, but closed back below that level. The Russell 2000 is just above that key short-term level, while the Dow Jones is approaching it.</p>
    	<p>Apple stock was a big contributor to the market's tough week. The Dow titan tumbled 7.1%, its worst weekly loss in nine months. AAPL stock gapped below the 50-day line on Friday following earnings, with its market cap back below $3 trillion.</p>	
    	<p>The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 9 basis points to 4.06%. But that's below the old 2023 highs. The yield got as high as 4.21% intraday Friday, a nine-month high and not far from the October 2022 15-year high of 4.31%. But the yield tumbled 13 basis points for the day.</p>	
    	<p>The July jobs report showed hiring trends are slowing, with two Fed policymakers signaling a shift away from further rate hikes. The two-year Treasury yield, more closely tied to Fed policy, fell 10 basis points on Friday and for the week to 4.79%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures rose 2.8% to $82.82 a barrel, a sixth straight weekly gain.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
    	<p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) tumbled 4.3% last week.  The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slumped 3.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gave up 3.9%. Nvidia is the No. 1 holding in SMH, with AVGO stock a notable holding as well.</p>	
    	<p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) plunged 8.2% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) sold off 8.85%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns some PLTR stock.</p>	
    	<p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) fell 1.9% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) dipped 0.2%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 4.4%, with DAL stock a big component. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) declined 0.7%, with TOL stock a notable holding. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) rose 1.25%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) fell back 2.1%, with LLY stock a notable component. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) stepped down 1.7%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) shed 0.8%. BRKB stock is the No. 1 holding in XLF, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire owning stakes in a number of other big financials, including Bank of America (BAC). The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dipped 0.3%.</p>
    	<p>Rising long-term yields and falling shorter-term rates is good news for banks.</p>	
      <h3>Stocks To Watch</h3>
    	<p>Nvidia stock slumped 4.4% to 446.80, but did rise slightly after testing the 10-week line on Wednesday. Investors could try to add shares with a strong bounce. But a longer pause, perhaps with an actual touch of the 10-week line, would be preferable. Nvidia is the clear AI chip leader and the poster child for the Ailed market rally, so investors should be paying close attention to its action.</p>	
    	<p>AVGO stock sank 2% to 881.65 last week. The chipmaker has flirted with a 921.78 buy point from a 16%-deep consolidation, according to MarketSmith analysis. The base is odd, starting with a downside reversal on a massive spike May 30. But Broadcom, which is also getting a big AI lift, has tightened up while the 10-week line is catching up. Last week's move may be part of a healthy shakeout.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock fell 4.7% to 253.86, closing just above the 50-day line but below the 10-week. Shares are hitting resistance at the 21-day line. A strong move above the 21-day line could offer an early entry into the EV giant. Meanwhile, Tesla stock has an official cup-with-handle buy point of 299.29 on a deep consolidation going back to last September.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla continues to increase discounts, adding to pressure on margins. An updated Model 3, with an eye at lower production costs, may begin production at the Shanghai plant later this month, according to local social media posts. Tesla China sales, including exports, hit a 2023 low last month, perhaps as Shanghai cuts production of the current Model 3.</p>
      <p>Delta stock fell 2.5% to 44.59, testing its 10-week line before a slim gain Friday. Shares have retreated from a two-year high of 49.81 following earnings last month, but DAL stock is looking better than other airline stocks. A strong bounce, perhaps above the 21-day line, would offer an early entry. Investors also could view 49.81 as a handle buy point to a massive base starting in March 2021.</p>	
    	<p>TOL stock fell 1% to 79.39 last week, bouncing back Friday from the 10-week line with a 2.2% gain, albeit in below-average volume. Toll Bros. could be actionable from a move above  a short trendline, using the Aug. 1 high of 81 as an entry point. The luxury homebuilder is a few weeks away from a new base.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally suffered significant losses last week amid rising Treasury yields, with Friday's downside reversal discouraging.</p>	
    	<p>The market has been due for a sideways stretch. The Nasdaq is just above its 50-day line, the smallest gap in four months. A longer pause or pullback also would be healthy.</p>
      <p>Market breadth remains strong with leadership across many sectors.</p>	
    	<p>Many leading stocks are finding key support or working on bases. Some of the names finding 50-day/10-week support, including Tesla stock, Toll Bros. and DAL, could be setting up for bullish moves. But they could also break those key levels, especially if the broader market retreats.</p>
      <p>Treasury yields are clearly a major factor for the stock market rally right now. If the 10-year yield tumbles back below 4%, the indexes could move back toward recent highs. If yields resume their sharp advance and approach long-term peaks, the uptrend would likely come under further pressure.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>	
    	<p>With the market rally under pressure, investors don't want to be too aggressive. As a practical matter, not many stocks are flashing buy signals at the moment. But, a lot of stocks are close to doing so. So spend this weekend running screens and building up your watchlists.</p>
      <p>With the market at a possible inflection point, investors have to stay flexible.</p>	
    	<p>In the past week, investors may have wanted to take a more-defensive stance, taking some profits and trimming exposure somewhat. If the market shows further weakness, investors may need to step that up, so review your portfolio closely.</p>
      <p>If stocks flash buy signals and you take action, do so gradually. The past few weeks of up-and-down trading, including Friday, have meant that many recent buys have quickly struggled.</p>
      <p>Earnings season is far from over. This past week saw several big winners but also a lot of major losers.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Greece’s investment-grade status was restored by Scope Ratings, evidence of its progress in repairing public finances 13 years after it became the first euro-zone member to be cut to junk.</p>
    	<p>Friday’s decision helps draw a line under the debt crisis that erupted in 2010 and required three international bailout programs as Greece’s membership of the now 20-member euro zone was thrown into question.</p>	
    	<p>It also follows the resounding reelection of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who’s pledged sound state finances and a continuation of the economic reforms he embarked on four years ago.</p>	
    	<p>“A steady trajectory of decline in public debt, on the back of high inflation, above-potential real economic growth, low average interest costs of the prevailing debt portfolio and achievement of primary fiscal surpluses” is among drivers for the upgrade, Scope said in a statement lifting Greek sovereign rating to BBB- from BB+.</p>
      <p>It also cited “sustained European institutional support for Greece,” while added that “credit ratings remain challenged,” mainly due to high government debt.</p>
      <p>The upgrade was widely expected by investors, who have been buying the nation’s bonds at lower yields than those of investment-grade peers like Italy, making them the euro area’s best performers this year. That’s a turnaround after many were burnt in the largest sovereign restructuring in history.</p>
      <p>Scope’s assessments aren’t currently recognized by the European Central Bank — meaning it won’t accept Greek bonds as collateral. But that situation may change soon as the Frankfurt-based institution reviews Scope’s eligibility.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect other ratings firms to follow Scope’s example over the coming months, with Mitsotakis targeting upgrades by year-end. Before Friday’s announcement, Japan’s Rating and Investment Information Inc. was the first credit assessor to lift Greece to investment.</p>
      <p>The move by Scope is “a development that further strengthens the forecasts for an upgrade by the end of the year also by the rating agencies recognized by the European Central Bank,” the Greek Finance Ministry said in a statement Saturday.</p>
      <p>The government will continue the same policy of fiscal seriousness and responsibility which is the only stable basis for the development of the Greek economy, the ministry said.</p>
      <p>DBRS Morningstar on Friday highlighted that Greece is on the threshold of an investment grade rating, saying it was focused on the implementation of structural reforms, improvements in economic prospects and the country’s commitment to fiscal consolidation.</p>
      <p>With Mitsotakis planning to repay rescue loans early and trim the ratio of debt to economic output below 140% by 2027 from a high of 206% in 2020, investors had already been piling into Greek bonds.</p>
      <p>The benefits of attaining investment status will be huge and haven’t been fully priced in yet, according to Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras. Only one in 10 funds can invest in a jurisdiction rated below that, he said last month.</p>
      <p>Other Mitsotakis promises for his second term include cutting unemployment to 8%, boosting exports to 60% of gross domestic product and returning to primary budget surpluses of 2%-2.5% of GDP a year.</p>
      <p>“Structural reforms that have meaningfully curtailed high non-performing loan ratios and substantively enhanced banking-system stability alongside policies aligned with Recovery and Resilience Facility funding and the European Semester mobilizing investment and boosting recovery” also supported Friday’s action, Scope said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed lower for a loss of 0.4% Friday on reports that a cyberattack hit hospital computer systems across several states. Top gainers in the Dow Jones included Amgen (AMGN), which jumped on earnings. But Apple (AAPL) was a drag, down nearly 5%.</p>
    	<p>Amgen gapped up close to its 200-day moving average on a nice earnings and revenue beat. It also upped its full-year forecast. But Wall Street frowned on Apple's earnings report, which showed another quarter of declining revenue. IPhone and iPad revenue missed expectations, but services were a bright spot, with revenue up 8% to $21.2 billion. Apple stock gapped below the 50-day moving average.</p>	
    	<p>Microsoft (MSFT) also outperformed in the Dow Jones today, but it's still stuck below its 50-day moving average.</p>	
    	<p>The July jobs report was a focal point in the stock market today. Nonfarm payrolls came in at 187,000, just below the 200,000 consensus. June payroll growth was revised slightly lower to 185,000 from an initially reported 209,000. The Federal Reserve wants to see some softness in the labor market to help bring inflation down. But wages rose more than expected, up 0.4% month over month and 4.4% year over year.</p>
      <p>Federal funds futures traders aren't expecting the Fed to raise interest rates at the September meeting. In fact, they think the current federal funds rate will be right where it is now (5.25% to 5.5%) at the end of the year.</p>
    	<p>After three straight gains, the 10-year yield slumped 14 basis points to around 4.05%. The U.S. dollar fell sharply, too.</p>
      <h3>Outside The Dow Jones</h3>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq composite also turned lower after a strong early move above the 14,000 level. It closed with a loss of 0.4%. Preliminary data showed lower volume on the Nasdaq, with declining stocks only having a slight edge over advancers.</p>	
    	<p>Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included enterprise software giant Atlassian (TEAM), which rallied sharply after reporting strong Q2 results.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500, up 0.8% intraday, turned lower and closed with a loss of 0.5%. Preliminary data showed slightly higher volume on the NYSE, with winners having a slight edge over losers.</p>
    	<p>Several leading growth stocks have come under heavy selling pressure in recent days. The Nasdaq marked a harsh distribution day Wednesday, falling 2.2% in higher volume, putting the stock market uptrend under pressure.</p>	
    	<p>A weak earnings report from Fortinet (FTNT) fueled broad-based selling among security software firms. Fortinet gapped below its 200-day moving average and was down 25% in late trading. Group peer Palo Alto Networks (PANW) slumped below its 50-day line in heavy volume, falling around 8%.</p>	
    	<p>Amazon.com (AMZN) was an earnings winner, up 8% in strong volume. Revenue at Amazon Web Services rose 12% to $22.1 billion. Ad revenue jumped 22% to $10.7 billion. AMZN guided Q3 revenue above expectations.</p>
      <p>At one point Friday, Amazon picked up $139.7 billion in market cap, making it the 10th largest one-day market cap gain in history.</p>
    	<p>Several technology stocks in the Dow Jones index came under selling pressure, but losses were contained. Cisco Systems (CSCO) gave back 1%, while Salesforce (CRM) eased 0.5%.</p>	
    	<h3>Growth Stocks On The Move</h3>
      <p>Dropbox (DBX), tracked in the top-rated database software group, soared nearly 6% after reporting strong Q2 results. DBX is in a follow-on buy zone after a bullish bounce off its 10-week moving average.</p>	
    	<p>Two other top stocks found support at their 10-week lines this week: Shake Shack (SHAK) and Martin Marietta (MLM). SHAK and MLM are new additions to the Leaderboard model portfolio, which is about 70% invested at this point.</p>
      <p>Booking Holdings (BKNG) gapped above its short-term moving averages and the 3,000 level, rising nearly 8% to an all-time high. Adjusted profit jumped 97% to $37.62 a share. Revenue increased 27% to $5.46 billion. CEO Glenn Fogel said the company expects a record summer travel season.</p>
    	<p>Retail leader Floor & Decor (FND) gapped down to its 50-day line and held support for most of the session. But the stock closed near session lows and just below the support level. Earnings and revenue came in mostly in line with expectations.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) managed to close higher on Friday as UK housebuilding continued to suffer from high interest rates, and the US economy added fewer new jobs than expected last month.</p>
    	<p>London's benchmark index had a rollercoaster day, starting lower and closing 0.5% up, while the CAC (^FCHI) gained 0.8% in Paris, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) was 0.3% higher.</p>	
    	<p>According to S&P Global there was a sharp fall in house building in July as new orders were constrained by rising borrowing costs.</p>	
    	<p>It meant that residential construction work declined for eight consecutive months, with construction companies noting that rising interest rates had led to fewer sales enquiries and slower decision-making among clients during the month.</p>
      <p>The reading came in at 43.0, up from June’s 39.6, but still well below the 50-point mark showing stagnation.</p>
      <p>The construction Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) recovered to 51.7, its highest level since February, and up from June’s five-month low of 48.9.</p>
      <p>John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: "Although the sector showed a slight uplift in activity in July, there is a question mark over the sustainability of this growth and the challenges that lie beneath the floorboards.</p>
      <p>"Decisions about buying a new home are being delayed by many consumers. Another fall in residential building levels and for the eighth month in a row, it’s obvious that UK interest rate rises and cost of living pressures have dealt a hammer blow to the housing sector. The commercial and civil engineering sectors remained the only engines of growth last month."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, German factory orders saw their highest jump in three years in June in a sign that the economy is stabilising. Demand climbed 7% from the previous month, thanks to major orders, beating expectations of a decline.</p>
      <p>"European markets underwent another negative session yesterday as this week’s sell off continued to gather momentum, with the DAX falling for the 4th day in a row, while the FTSE100 finished lower for the 3rd straight session, although it was notable that we closed well off the lows of the day," Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said.</p>
      <p>World stock markets are set for their worst week since March. According to Reuters the MSCI All-World index is headed for its biggest weekly drop in five months.</p>
      <p>Across the pond, the US non-farm payroll rose by 187,000 in July, below forecasts of an increase of 200,000.</p>
      <p>June’s NFP was also revised down 209,000 to 185,000, while May’s was cut from 306,000 to 281,000, meaning fewer jobs were created in the spring than initially thought.</p>
      <p>The US Bureau of Labour Statistics has also reported that the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, down from 3.6% in June.</p>
      <h3>Blog close and recap</h3>
      <p>Well that's all from us today - thanks for following along. Be sure to catch us again on Monday.</p>
      <p>Here's a quick reminder of today's top stories:</p>
      <p>UK car sales rise for 12 months in a row</p>
      <p>WPP shares slide 7%</p>
      <p>Capita shares plummet as cyber attack costs up to £25m</p>
      <p>UK housebuilding knocked by high interest rates</p>
      <p>US adds 187,000 new jobs in July</p>
      <p>Apple market cap falls back below $3trn</p>
      <h3>Interest rate hikes slowing UK inflation</h3>
      <p>Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s (BoE) chief economist, has said he sees growing evidence that interest rate hikes are slowing down UK inflation.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a briefing for the Bank’s agents about Thursday’s interest rate decision and monetary policy report, he said Threadneedle Street’s consecutive run of rate hikes was bringing down the cost of borrowing.</p>
      <p>UK inflation dropped to a 15-month low of 7.9% in the year to June — the lowest reading since March 2022. Economists predicted that the rate would dip to 8.2% from 8.7% in both April and May.</p>
      <p>But while the rate of inflation is slowing, it is still nearly four times more than the BoE’s 2% target, and higher than in other advanced economies.</p>
      <p>"The monetary policy committee (MPC) is committed to achieving its target," Pill said during the presentation. "There are increasing signs that the policy actions it's taken over the last 18 months are working in pursuit of that target."</p>
      <p>He added that “MPC analysis focused on inflation persistence” and that “higher rates are helping curb inflation and pay”.</p>
      <p>“We are trying to balance the risks of doing too little, but it is possible that we do too much,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Apple market cap falls back below $3trn</h3>
      <p>Apple has lost its status as the world’s only $3trn company thanks to a slowdown in iPhone sales.</p>
      <p>The tech company revealed last night in its earnings update that sales for its iPhones fell in the three months to June, leading to it posting a third straight quarter of revenue losses.</p>
      <p>The news sent shares down 3.5% to $184 after the bell in New York, knocking $100bn from its overall value.</p>
      <p>It is now trading 2.7% lower, with a valuation of $2.93trn.</p>
      <h3>More on US jobs...</h3>
      <p>Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, said:</p>
      <p>"Today’s jobs report is slightly weaker than expected. Last month’s results offered evidence that employment growth had begun to slow, and today’s numbers indicate that a downward trend may be in motion.</p>
      <p>"While this should be encouraging for policymakers as they continue to battle sticky inflation, the Fed would likely prefer to see wage gains closer to 3%. Growth in the 4% region may not be enough to convince bankers that monetary policy is working, so further interest rate hikes may be around the corner.”</p>
      <h3>US adds 187,000 new jobs in July</h3>     
      <p>US non-farm payrolls rose by 187,000 in July, below forecasts of an increase of 200,000.</p>
      <p>June’s NFP was also revised down from 209,000 to 185,000, while May’s has been cut from 306,000 to 281,000.</p>
      <p>This means fewer jobs were created in the spring than initially thought, as a string of 11 interest rate rises by the US Federal Reserve since March 2022 has reduced the number of new positions.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Labour Statistics added that the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in July, down from 3.6% the previous month.</p>
      <h3>Wall Street set to open higher</h3>
      <p>With just over an hour to go before the bell in New York, stocks across the pond look set to open in positive territory.</p>
      <p>S&P 500 futures (ES=F) are up 0.2%, Dow futures (YM=F) have risen 0.1%, and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) are 0.2% higher.</p>
      <p>We will find out about the latest US jobs report in a few minutes too.</p>
      <h3>Capita shares plummet as cyber attack costs up to £25m</h3>
      <p>Capita slumped 15% in London on Friday, the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 (^FTMC), after a recent Russian cyber attack heavily impacted the company.</p>
      <p>The outsourcing firm dropped to a statutory pre-tax loss of £67.9m for the six months to 30 June following the impact of disposals and costs linked to the data breach. This was a fall from £100,000 profit the previous year.</p>
      <p>The attack hacked its Microsoft Office 365 software and accessed the personal data of staff working for the company and dozens of clients.</p>
      <p>Capita said the loss was also driven by business exits and a goodwill impairment.</p>
      <p>It expects the cyber attack to cost between £20m and £25m, comprising of specialist professional fees, recovery and remediation costs and investments to its cyber security.</p>
      <p>“Having taken extensive steps to recover and secure our data, using third party monitoring we still have found no evidence of any information in circulation, on the dark web or otherwise, more than three months after the cyber incident," it said.</p>
      <p>Capita manages crucial services for local councils, the military, and the NHS.</p>
      <h3>Mortgage rate update</h3>
      <p>Moneyfacts have released their latest daily mortgage rates.</p>
      <p>It has reported that the average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate is 6.85%. This is unchanged from the previous working day – and since Tuesday, when it rose from Monday’s 6.81%.</p>
      <p>However, this provides little relief for those seeking longer-term fixed rates.</p>
      <p>The average five-year fixed residential mortgage rate today has dropped to 6.35%, down from 6.36% on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>How to improve your credit score before buying a house</h3>
      <p>With lenders increasing mortgage rates and tightening up on their affordability criteria, having a healthy credit score is becoming increasingly important for those wanting to get on the housing ladder.</p>
      <p>It's a good idea to become more informed about your credit score prior to seeking a mortgage and begin monitoring and building your credit score before purchasing a new home.</p>
      <h3>Business registrations fall amid climbing interest rates</h3>
      <p>Experts at Forbes Advisor have conducted an analysis of the most recent UK business demography statistics report from the Office for National Statistics.</p>
      <p>Here are some of their key findings:</p>
      <p>*UK business registrations drop by 14% in Q2 2023 compared to the same period last year</p>
      <p>*Transportation & Storage sector hit hardest with 59% decrease in business births in Q2 2023 vs Q2 2022</p>
      <p>*Wales faces largest drop in business ‘births’, with a 34% decrease in new business registrations year on year</p>
      <p>*There has been a notable 15% improvement in business survival rates in Q2 2023 vs Q2 2022</p>
      <h3>Gold price faces the strength of dollar</h3>
      <p>The price of gold (GC=F) is at a crossroads as the weekend approaches, coinciding with the rise of the US dollar and the yields of US Treasury bonds.</p>
      <p>Gold was trading flat at $1968.80 at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>"Traders are anticipating more significant market events, notably the release of Non-Farm Payrolls data later today," Rania Gule, market analyst at XS.com, said.</p>
      <p>"Moreover, the downgrade of the US sovereign debt rating from AAA to AA+ by Fitch has led to increased concerns and a notable decline in market risk appetite.</p>
      <p>"From a technical perspective, the current gold price is testing the support trendline at $1930, and in the event of a downside break, the next support could be in the range of $1885 to $1895.</p>
      <p>This price zone includes a series of previous lows, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the movement from $1614 to $2062. In the bullish scenario, resistance could be seen at the recent peak level of $1950, followed by stubborn resistance at $2000."</p>
      <h3>Airport parking could cost 300% more</h3>
      <p>Holidaymakers who park at UK airports could be paying four times the price — or hundreds more — by not booking ahead, according to a new analysis.</p>
      <p>Travellers could stand to save £150 on average with forward planning, consumer group Which? found after analysing prices at 16 airport car parks. It said the analysis reveals leaving it to the last minute can come with a "serious financial sting.”</p>
      <p>The consumer group looked at the differences between the prices a traveller could expect to pay for a week’s stay in August on the day versus booking four months in advance.</p>
      <p>In the most expensive case, Which? found travellers could pay as much as £583 on the day for a week of parking.</p>
      <p>The biggest saving was at Manchester Airport's multi-storey car park, where paying on the day would cost you four times (327%) as much. A week's stay booked four months in advance was charged at £95, compared with a staggering £406 on the day of departure.</p>
      <h3>Asia and Wall Street</h3>
      <p>Stocks in Asia climbed on Friday after China’s new central bank governor met with real estate developers, saying they would be allowed to raise more money by selling bonds.</p>
      <p>The Nikkei (^N225) climbed 0.1% on the day in Japan, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) gained almost 0.5% in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) advanced 0.2%.</p>
      <p>Across the pond, Wall Street sank for a third day in a row. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.25% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.1% lower at the close. The Dow Jones (^DJI) dipped 0.2% lower during the session.</p>
      <p>Traders will be focusing on July’s US jobs figures later today. Economists predict around 200,000 new jobs were created in America last month, down on the 209,000 the previous month, with the unemployment rate coming in steady at 3.6%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was in the red on Thursday, with the pound (GBPUSD=X) also trading lower, as traders digested news that the Bank of England had increased interest rates from 5% to 5.25%.</p>
    	<p>London's benchmark index fell 0.8% by noon trade, hovering just above a two-week low, while the CAC (^FCHI) tumbled 0.7% in Paris, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) was 0.8% lower.</p>	
    	<p>The move, which was widely expected by economists, means UK interest rates are now at a fresh 15-year high. It was the 14th consecutive increase, as the Bank battles runaway inflation.</p>	
    	<p>The Bank also warned on Thursday that interest rates will remain high for at least two years while forecasting that inflation will hit its 2% target in the second quarter of 2025.</p>
      <p>The pound which was already trading lower during the day, weakened further after the announcement, down 0.5% at $1.26 and 0.4% lower at €1.16.</p>
      <p>"With stubbornly high services inflation and a remarkably resilient jobs market, the Bank of England had no choice but to hike again today," James de Bunsen, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said.</p>
      <p>"Real signs of pain in the housing market earlier this week all but ruled out another 50bps rise. However, the MPC will keep administering its bitter medicine to the economy until it cures those price pressures. And, like a toxic course of chemo, this patient is going to feel a whole lot worse before it starts to get better."</p>
      <p>The hike will mean further pain for mortgage rates. Higher mortgage rates are ready starting to weigh on the UK property sector, where prices are falling by the most since 2009.</p>
      <p>For the roughly 150,000 borrowers on tracker or variable rate mortgages in London, today's hike means an instant hike in mortgage payments.</p>
      <p>However, for the majority of homeowners who are on fixed-rate deals, the effect will not be felt until their fixes expire.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin falls on Binance fraud charge fear</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin dipped over 2% following news the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly contemplating bringing fraud charges against cryptocurrency exchange Binance.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below the $29,000 mark in early trade in Asia, but then bounced back modestly, with its price settling around $29,100 (£22,956), down over 2%.</p>
      <p>The DOJ is hesitating over the fraud charges due to concerns over the negative impact on the larger crypto industry, according to Semafor.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors are concerned charges against Binance could cause a run on the platform. They fear a repeat of the FTX collapse in November 2022 when an indictment led to a bank run that caused many retail investors to lose their money.</p>
      <h3>Era of cheap food has come to an end</h3>
      <p>The Bank’s decision today to raise its policy rate by 25 basis points reflects the good, the bad and the ugly of tightening monetary policy.</p>
      <p>The more positive news is that the inflation, which is currently running at 7.9pc, is expected to fall further. The Bank’s conditional forecasts show that they are due to fall to 5pc by the end of the year and that it will hit the Bank’s target by the beginning of 2025. Monetary policy is working.</p>
      <p>The bad news is that even though food inflation is expected to moderate, food prices will remain high and not decrease. This means that the era of cheap food has probably come to an end in the UK. It also highlights the need to build resilience in the UK economy by doing more to bolster the domestic food growing industry.</p>
      <p>The ugly news is that financial conditions are tightening for both homeowners with mortgages and those who are renting. The Bank estimates that four million additional households will face higher mortgage payments by the end of 2025.</p>
      <p>Rental prices for new lets are increasing at double digits rates. The cooling in the housing market means that housing investment is expected to decrease, which is likely to lead to fewer houses being built in the future.</p>
      <h3>Will the UK go into recession?</h3>
      <p>During the press conference, Andrew Bailey said it was the Bank's job to ensure inflation falls all the way back to its 2% target and stays low.</p>
      <p>He added: "We do recognise, and I think it’s very important to say, that inflation has a very serious effect particularly on those least well off.</p>
      <p>"But I will emphasise that the economy is more resilient. Yes unemployment has gone up a bit, but it is still at historically low levels. We haven’t experienced a recession and we’re not forecasting one."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, said:</p>
      <p><strong>"With over 500 basis points in cumulative tightening so far, it is hard to see the UK avoiding a period of weak economic growth.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Pandemic savings and cost-of-living support have been providing a buffer to UK households, but the delayed impact of rate rises, including the impact of higher mortgage rates, will start to bite.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Whether or not a recession formally occurs is secondary to the bigger picture – when we look back at this period in decades to come, we’ll likely see this as the middle of a multi-year stretch of near-zero growth."</strong></p>
      <h3>BoE on inflation</h3>
      <p>The Bank added on Thursday that it is forecasting inflation will hit its 2% target in the second quarter of 2025.</p>
      <p>It also warned that interest rates will remain high for at least two years, and downgraded its expectation for GDP growth for this year to 0.5% from 0.75%.</p>
      <h3>Chancellor responds to interest rates decision</h3>
      <p>Chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:</p>
      <p><strong>“If we stick to the plan, the Bank forecasts inflation will be below 3% in a year's time without the economy falling into a recession.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“But that doesn't mean it's easy for families facing higher mortgage bills so we will continue to do what we can to help households.'”</strong></p>
      <h3>Bank of England raises interest rates to new 15-year high</h3>
      <p>The Bank of England has increased interest rates by 0.25% to 5.25%, its 14th consecutive hike, as it aims to combat high inflation.</p>
      <p>The move, which was widely expected by economists, means UK interest rates are now at a fresh 15-year high.</p>
      <p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in a three-way split over the rate rise.</p>
      <p>Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said:</p>
      <p><strong>“It’s perhaps a little astonishing that, with inflation sitting at 7.9%, the Bank of England has managed to sound somewhat dovish today.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Clearly the weaker-than-expected June inflation number has strongly influenced the Bank’s decision to hike by just 25 basis points rather than the 50 basis points, although the three-way split in voting suggests that there are still a couple of hawks who are very concerned by the extremely elevated inflation numbers.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Bank’s growth outlook is appropriately bleak. While Rishi Sunak will be relieved to see the UK is expected to escape recession, economic stagnation through to 2025 will certainly make for a challenging election backdrop.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Policy rates may not rise all the way to 6%, as had been feared a month ago, but the economic damage will still be significant.”</strong></p>
      <h3>BoE: Positive Money protest</h3>
      <p>We are just moments away from the Bank of England decision at noon. Here are some photos of protestors outside of Threadneedle Street this morning.</p>
      <p>As well as an end to interest rate hikes, the protesters are calling for a windfall tax on the excess profits banks have made off the back of soaring rates.</p>
      <p>They held balloons bearing the figure of £28.93 billion, reflecting the profits of the Big Four UK banks for the first half of this year and symbolising how they’ve “ballooned” 80% since last year, when they were £16.6 billion.</p>
      <p>Hannah Dewhirst, head of campaigns at Positive Money, said:</p>
      <p><strong>“We came out today to tell the Bank of England that we’ve had enough of senseless interest rate rises.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“Rate rises are failing to bring down inflation fuelled by international fossil fuel prices and food prices disrupted by climate change. They will only continue to impoverish households and enrich banks.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“What we need are better tools for dealing with inflation than blunt instruments like interest rates, and a windfall tax on bank profits to redress the harm done to workers and families by rate hikes."</strong></p>
      <h3>London Stock Exchange Group boosted by interest rates</h3>
      <p>The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L) was among the top fallers in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Thursday. despite revealing a jump in income from rising interest rates and growth in its data operation.</p>
      <p>The stock sank around 6% in early trade following as it slightly missed profit estimates for its first half. Adjusted operating profit hit £1.4bn ($1.78bn), compared to a consensus estimate of £1.5bn. This was almost flat compared with a year ago.</p>
      <p>Capital markets was the segment that grew the least, up 1.5% on the year. Meanwhile post-trade grew 19.2% and the data and analytics business was up 7.6%.</p>
      <h3>Next ups profit forecast</h3>
      <p>Next has announced its second quarter trading statement today. Here are the top lines:</p>
      <p><strong>Full price sales were up 6.9% versus last year in the second quarter (May to July)The end of season sale went well with clearance rates ahead of group expectationsNext has increased its full year profit before tax guidance by £10m to £845m</strong></p>
      <p>Charlie Huggins of Wealth Club said:</p>
      <p><strong>"Next pulled a rabbit out of the hat on 19 June when it said sales had been much better than expected in the first seven weeks of the year. Since then sales growth has remained robust with Next ending the first half strongly.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Despite this excellent first half performance, Next remains cautious and is expecting sales to be broadly flat in the second half, a material slowdown.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>So far, 2023 has not been anywhere near as bad as expected for the UK consumer, and this has benefitted Next and its peers. The big question is - how much longer can this last? Recent signs that inflation is moderating offers hope for the economy, but the longer interest rates stay above 5% the greater the likely squeeze on disposable incomes."</strong></p>
      <h3>Pound hits lowest level since June</h3>
      <p>The pound has fallen to its lowest level since June ahead of the Bank of England rate decision at noon today.</p>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) is down against the US dollar by 0.5% to 1.2649. Against the euro, sterling (GBPEUR=X) was 0.3% lower to 1.1578.</p>
      <p>Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates to a 15-year high of 5.25%, up from its current level of 5%, as the Bank seeks to tame inflation.</p>
      <p>Sterling was the best performing major currency against the dollar in the first half of the year due to expectations the Bank would have to raise rates further than its global peers.</p>
      <h3>Gold gains reverse after US credit rating downgrade</h3>
      <p>Gold has been trading at around $1,950 an ounce for most of this year. The precious metal is often seen as a safe haven. Photo: Getty.</p>
      <p>Gold prices reversed some of its gains on Thursday after Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating, which weighed on the US dollar, and had boosted the safe-haven asset.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, Gold (GC=F) was trading down 0.26% at $1,969.80 an ounce.</p>
      <p>Since the start of the year it has gained about 8% but has not returned to the $2,081.58 peak seen on 3 May — close to the high last seen in March the previous year, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>U.S. stock futures remained in a slump on Thursday as the U.S. credit rating downgrade by Fitch continued to sour sentiment, with investors looking ahead to earnings results out of Big Tech in the day ahead.</p>
    	<p>Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 50 points, or 0.1%, after the index tumbled 348 points on Wednesday to finish at 35,282. S&P 500 futures shed 0.2%, with contracts tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 0.3% in the red.</p>	
    	<p>Fitch’s shock downgrade of the U.S. credit rating earlier this week has slammed the stock market—albeit not as much as the last time another major rating firm did the same, in 2011—and ushered the S&P 500 to its worst day since April on Wednesday. Stocks are still under pressure moving into Thursday as a shift in sentiment away from risk has continued with corporate earnings and key economic data looming.</p>	
    	<p>“In a couple of weeks we may have forgotten about the Fitch U.S. debt downgrade but it's certainly given the start of the month a big dose of volatility,” said Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. “All this excitement has occurred ahead of a big day today including the Bank of England rate decision, U.S. services ISM, jobless claims, unit labor costs, and productivity, with Apple and Amazon then reporting after the bell.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, quarterly earnings out of Big Tech are on tap, including from the world’s largest public company, Apple (ticker: AAPL), and fellow technology giant Amazon (AMZN), both reporting after the market close. After a big rally for tech stocks this year—which has buoyed the major indexes—the bar looks high for both companies.</p>
      <p>Economic data will also be in focus in the day ahead, though U.S. services ISM and other readings will likely be overshadowed by the highlight of the week coming Friday, when the U.S. jobs report for July is released. This report is a key bellwether for the strength of the U.S. economy and an influential data point for the Federal Reserve as the central bank mulls interest-rate policy at a watershed moment.</p>

    	<p>Investors reacted to the Fitch Rating agency’s downgrade of U.S. credit, sending long-term bonds higher and the Dow Jones lower by about 1%, or 350 points.</p>
    	<h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Dow Jones dropped almost 350 points, or about 1%, as stocks fell across indexes as Fitch cut the U.S. credit rating.</li>
        <li>Walgreens was up as its rival CVS reported positive results.</li>
        <li>Intel, Microsoft, Salesforce and Apple all fell as the tech sector lost 2.5%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Investors reacted to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by sending stocks lower across the board, along with boosting Treasury yields, to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by almost 1%, or about 350 points.</p>	
    	<p>The downgrade from the Fitch Ratings agency served to boost the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level since November, hitting 4.08%, which served to serve tech stocks lower.</p>	
    	<p>Since tech companies are primarily valued on profits expected to be earned in the future, higher bond yields make those future earnings look less valuable in comparison. Consequently, the Nasdaq dropped more than 2.1%, while the S&P 500 declined by 1.4%.</p>
      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was up 3.3% as its rival pharmacy retailer CVS (CVS) beat analyst estimates on earnings and revenues for the second quarter, sending CVS shares higher by 3.4%.</p>
      <p>Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares moved up 0.4% after it reached an agreement with cancer victims in its talc lawsuits to appeal a bankruptcy judge’s recent ruling that derailed the $9 billion settlement.</p>
      <p>Intel (INTC) shares fell 3.75% as its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported earnings that showed continued weakness in the PC market, helping send AMD shares lower by almost 7%.</p>
      <p>Shares of Walt Disney Company (DIS) traded lower by 3% while Boeing (BA) shares dropped 2.75%.</p>
      <p>Amid a broader technology sector decline of 2.5%, Microsoft (MSFT) was down 2.4%, Salesforce (CRM) lost 1.7% and Apple (AAPL) dropped 1.5% ahead of its earnings report, scheduled for after the market closes on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Dynatrace (DT) gapped below its 50-day moving average in a 13% sell-off despite a better-than-expected June quarter. CrowdStrike (CRWD) fell back below the 162.25 buy point of Tuesday's breakout as shares slid 7.5%.</p>
      <p>ELF Beauty (ELF) offset some of the IBD 50's loss as it soared 15% to a record high. The cosmetics products company sailed past June-quarter expectations and raised its full-year outlook.</p>
      <p>Among major stocks, Microsoft (MSFT) dipped below its 50-day moving average, and Alphabet (GOOGL) is back near its 127.10 buy point.</p>
      <h3>Fitch Downgrade Hits Stock Market</h3>
      <p>In an unpleasant surprise for the stock market, Fitch Ratings late Tuesday downgraded U.S. long-term debt from a best-possible AAA to AA+ with a stable outlook.</p>
      <p>"In Fitch's view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters," the rating agency said in announcing its decision. "The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management."</p>
      <p>Fitch also cited concerns about ballooning government deficits. It expects government deficits to rise to 6.3% of GDP in 2023, from 3.7% in 2022. That reflects weaker federal revenues, new spending initiatives and a higher interest burden. State and local governments are expected to run an overall deficit of 0.6% of GDP this year after running a small surplus of 0.2% of GDP in 2022.</p>
      <p>It was the first Fitch downgrade of U.S. debt since Aug. 5, 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 fell 6.7% the next day, which makes today's stock market reaction much more tolerable. Still, investors should be more guarded with risk-off now the predominant theme.</p>	
      <p>Earlier Wednesday, the ADP Employment Survey showed the job market was still firm. July payrolls of 324,000 fell from 455,000 in June, but it was well above forecasts for 185,000, according to FactSet. That doesn't show a weakening job market like the one the Fed might prefer.</p>
      <p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 4.11%. It's been above the 4% level three of the past five days. It is at the highest since Nov. 9, 2022.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil fell 2.5% to $79.34 a barrel. That's despite the fact that the Energy Information Administration reported a drop in inventories of 17 million barrels from the previous week.</p>
      <h3>Earnings Movers In Today's Stock Market</h3>
      <p>Technology and health care companies were among the big earnings movers this morning.</p>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reversed to a loss of 6.9% even after the chip company late Tuesday beat Q2 expectations. AMD cited growing sales of chips for artificial intelligence. The stock is meeting resistance at its 50-day moving average as it forms a base-on-base formation.</p>
      <p>Cardlytics (CDLX) vaulted 21% in huge volume, gapping to the highest level in nearly a year. The purchase analytics company beat Q2 expectations.</p>
      <p>But Dynatrace (DT), another tech leader, sold off 13% at midday in heavy volume, piercing its 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>Humana (HUM) gapped above its downward-trending 50-day moving average. The managed care provider topped second-quarter estimates and raised its estimate of Medicare Advantage membership.</p>
      <p>CVS Health (CVS) reversed higher by 3.6%. The operator of CVS drugstores and Aetna managed care topped sales and profit views. It cut its GAAP EPS guidance but maintained adjusted EPS guidance of $8.50 to $8.70.</p>
      <h3>Restaurant Results Mixed</h3>
    	<p>In the restaurant industry, Starbucks (SBUX) also reversed higher, up 2.7% at midday. The company gave a mixed June-quarter report late Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Yum Brands (YUM) — which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut — erased early losses and was up nearly 1% at midday. Wingstop (WING) reversed higher and is trying to reclaim its 200-day moving average. The company beat Q2 views and raised its same-store sales and store expansion forecasts.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stock indexes across Europe finished the day in the green on Monday in London, as the market parsed positive inflation readings in the bloc and higher than expected mortgage approval rates among Britons.</p>
    	<p>Fresh Bank of England data showed net mortgage approvals for house purchases up from 51,100 in May to 54,700 in June, while approvals for remortgaging rose from 34,100 to 39,100 during the same period.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was up 0.3% by the close in London, having fallen earlier in the session. Meanwhile the DAX (^GDAXI) was up 0.1% and the CAC (^FCHI) was up 0.5%.</p>
      <p>European markets were buoyed by a positive read on inflation. The bloc's consumer price index reading for June matched expectations, falling from 5.5% to 5.3%.</p>
      <p>US stocks were also modestly up by closing time in Europe. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Dow (^DJI) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) all rose by around 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, an announcement is due to be made by UK prime minister Rishi Sunak on the future of Britain's North Sea drilling operations.</p>	
    	<p>Sunak is set to lay out an expansion of carbon capture and storage as well as oil and gas drilling plans for the North Sea. These, the government says, are a bid to help Britain move towards net-zero by 2050.</p>
      <p>The announcement will contain details of two new CSS clusters to be developed in the north-east of Scotland and the Humber — sites which could support up to 50,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The plans have drawn protests from climate change groups who argue that new oil and gas drilling is a distraction from actual solutions to reducing emissions.</p>
      <p>Housebuilders are supporting the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and FTSE 250 (^FTMC) today, here's Michael Hewson from CMC Markets UK with the lowdown:</p>
      <p><strong>Both the FTSE100 and FTSE250 have fared reasonably well, with the FTSE100 closing at a 2-month high, with house builders seeing a bit of a rebound this month as interest rate rise expectations eased back from the peaks of a few weeks ago.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Persimmon had led the sector rebound, followed by Taylor Wimpey, while the better-than-expected numbers from Rolls-Royce last week catapulted it to the second-best performer this month behind Ocado, which has seen gains in excess of 60% in July, despite being one of the worst performers today.</strong></p>
      <h3>Mortgage approvals rise amid soaring interest rates</h3>	
    	<p>The Bank of England has released some key data on household money and credit:</p>
      <p>-- Net mortgage approvals for house purchases saw an increase from 51,100 in May to 54,700 in June, while approvals for remortgaging rose from 34,100 to 39,100 during the same period.</p>
      <p>-- The ‘effective’ interest rate – the actual interest rate paid – on newly drawn mortgages continued to exhibit sustained increases, having risen by a further seven basis points, to 4.63% in June.</p>
      <p>-- Net borrowing of consumer credit by individuals rose to £1.7bn in June, the highest since April 2018.</p>
      <p>No surprises here that interest rates on mortgages are tracking central bank rises. The net borrowing figure will be one for the Treasury to watch to assess the health of household finances overall.</p>
      <h3>Here are the Eurozone CPI readings for July:</h3>
      <p>-- Eurozone CPI (Y/Y) Jul: 5.3% (exp 5.3%; prev 5.5%)</p>
      <p>-- Eurozone CPI Core (Y/Y) Jul P: 5.5% (exp 5.4%; prev 5.5%)</p>
      <p>-- Eurozone CPI (M/M) Jul P: -0.1% (exp -0.1%; prev 0.3%)</p>
      <p>Oil prices were set for the biggest monthly gains in over a year in July, hovering at three-month highs in the last trading session of the month.</p>
      <p>Brent Crude (BZ=F) was sitting at around $84.90.</p>
      <p>The moves come on expectations that Saudi Arabia will extend its output cuts into September. The nation has already cut output by 1 million barrels per day.</p>
      <p>Brewing giant Heineken (HEIA.AS) reported a pullback in beer sales in its first half on Monday. The company put a 5.6% second quarter decline to disappointing performance in Vietnam and socio-economic volatility in Nigeria affecting consumer off-take accounted for over half of the decline in the first six months.</p>
      <p>It also cut its outlook for full-year profit growth.</p>
      <p>Stock dropped around 5% in Amsterdam on Monday morning following the report.</p>
      <h3>There's some bellwether housing data on the slate today. Watch out for:</h3>
      <p>-- The Nationwide House Price Index</p>
      <p>-- A UK mortgage approvals reading</p>
      <h3>Overnight in Asia and the US</h3>
      <p>Chinese stocks appear to have shrugged off the latest data that shows activity in the service sector and manufacturing activity has weakened. Equities rose on the hope that Beijing would step in with stimulus to restart the lagging economy.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) rose 1.5% while the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was up 0.6%. The official manufacturing sector PMI came in at 49.3, slightly ahead of consensus expectations of 49.2. The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes sectors such as construction and agriculture, was 51.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth.</p>
      <p>Japan's Nikkei (^N225) rose 1.3%, extending Friday's gains.</p>
      <p>US stocks also finished Friday in the green.</p>
      <p>Good morning! It's another week. Last week we saw a slew of central bank decisions and earnings calls around the world move markets — later this week the Bank of England is set to do the same.</p>
      <p>Happy Monday, let's get to it.</p>

      <p>Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM), Broadcom (AVGO), Skechers (SKX) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to watch in the current stock market rally.</p>	
      <p>Tesla is an IBD Leaderboard stock, while Boeing and Skechers were recent IBD Stocks Of The Day.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
    	<p>After Monday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved down 0.15% in morning action.</p>

      <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "Buyers came back into the stock market Friday after a harsh downside reversal for the major stock indexes Thursday. Friday's gains were fueled by mostly in-line inflation data inside the Personal Income and Spending report, along with another round of solid earnings reports."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column as the stock market is at this year's highs.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Boeing, Caterpillar, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Aerospace giant Boeing broke out last week, surpassing a 223.91 flat-base entry. Shares are just out of the 5% buy area that went up to 235.11. BA stock dipped 0.3% Monday morning.</p>

      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla rallied 4.2% Friday, snapping a three-day losing streak. Amid the recent pullback, Tesla shares are trying to find support around their key 50-day line. A decisive rebound would place the electric-vehicle leader in a new buy area.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock looked to add to Friday's gains, trading up 0.7% Monday morning.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock added 1.35% Friday, holding near its recent highs. AAPL stock continues to hold sharply above a 157.38 buy point. Apple will report fiscal third-quarter results late Thursday. Early Monday, shares edged higher in morning action.</p>

      <h3>For Immediate Release</h3>
    	<p>Chicago, IL – July 31, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses CME Group CME, Intercontinental Exchange ICE, Cboe Global Markets CBOE, Nasdaq NDAQ and Coinbase Global Inc. COIN.</p>
    	<h3>Industry: Securities & Exchanges</h3>
      <p>A compelling and diversified product portfolio helps drive revenues of Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry players. An increase in trading volumes, product expansion through prudent acquisitions and the increased adoption of a greater number of crypto assets are expected to benefit CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange, Cboe Global Markets, Nasdaq and Coinbase Global Inc.. Increased focus on accelerating their non-trading revenue base, which includes market technology, listing and information revenues, infuses dynamism in the business profile of the industry players. However, alterations in investment patterns, and priorities and compliance with regulations pose challenges.</p>
      <h3>About the Industry</h3>
      <p>The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry comprises companies that operate electronic marketplaces, which facilitate the buying and selling of stocks, stock options, and bonds or commodity contracts. They facilitate trading across a diverse range of products in multiple asset classes and geographies. They generate revenues from fees received from the listed companies on their exchanges.</p>
      <p>They also provide a range of data and listing services to global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, investments, risk management, desktops, and connectivity solutions, as well as corporate and ETF listing services, on the cash equity exchanges of players. The industry is witnessing increased adoption of crypto assets. Yet, industry players have to comply with a number of regulations, resulting in challenges.</p>
      <h3>3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Securities and Exchanges Industry</h3>
      <p><strong>Volatility Fueling Trading Volume: </strong>The players in the industry are largely dependent on product and service portfolios for revenues. Major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services plus trading, and clearing systems services. Other revenue sources include data products and financial indexes along with information and public company services.</p>
      <p>The maximization of transaction and clearing fees and the lowering of transaction-based expenses drive profits. Sustainable trading volume growth, driven by trading volatility, fuels transaction and clearing fees (a major component of the top line of industry players). Increasing focus on accelerating the non-trading revenue base, which includes market technology, listing and information revenues, infuses dynamism in the business profiles of the industry participants.</p>
      <p><strong>Mergers and acquisitions:</strong> The industry continues to witness mergers and acquisitions, with companies evaluating opportunities to supplement their internal growth story by forging strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies. These enable them to penetrate untapped markets, offer new products or services and enhance the value of their platforms and existing trade-related operations. Additionally, strategic buyouts lead to a diversified product portfolio (the primary growth catalyst) and help industry participants maintain their domestic market share, as well as fortify their global footprint.</p>
      <p><strong>Continuous Investment in Technology:</strong> Industry players continue to invest heavily in technological development. Focus on building a strategic economic market model via technological advancements and upgrades of products and services will help all exchanges stay afloat amid changing industry dynamics.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the players have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machine learning, automation and algorithms designed to improve trading decisions, while reducing trading inefficiencies, cyber threats and human errors, thus accelerating trading frequency. Players are also investing in automating non-trading operations that play an important part in revenue generation for the companies. Nonetheless, players have to comply with various regulations that are being implemented.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</h3>
      <p>The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #57, which places it in the top 23% of the 253 Zacks industries.</p>

    	<p>By Makiko Yamazaki and Anton Bridge</p>
    	<p>TOKYO (Reuters) -Two of Japan's megabanks reported solid quarterly profits on Monday amid hopes the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) nudge towards policy normalisation will herald a sea change in their business after years of being squeezed by rock-bottom interest rates.</p>	
    	<p>The central bank's relaxation of its cap on bond yields on Friday boosted the prospect of higher government bond yields creating a windfall for lenders, sending Japan's benchmark index of banking stocks to an eight-year high.</p>	
    	<p>Higher government bond yields will in the long run lift returns on bond holdings at major lenders, which have had limited options for where to park huge deposits and so flocked to higher-yielding assets overseas such as U.S. Treasuries.</p>
      <p>The tailwind comes as top banks revamp their businesses to withstand ultra-low rates at home by slimming domestic retail operations, beefing up their presence in Asia through acquisitions and ramping up U.S. investment banking.</p>
      <p>Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) and Mizuho Financial Group, Japan's second- and third-largest lenders by assets respectively, on Monday stuck to their full-year net profit forecasts, which point to their highest earnings since the mid 2010s.</p>
      <p>Both forecasts have not factored in the impact of the latest policy shift.</p>
      <p>"It might take a while till the BOJ ends its negative interest rate policy," IwaiCosmo Securities analyst Tomoaki Kawasaki said. "But the business environment for the Japanese lenders is improving."</p>
      <p>For April-June, SMFG reported a net profit of 248 billion yen ($1.75 billion), down 1.8% from the same period a year earlier but accounting for 30% of its annual profit forecast of 820 billion yen.</p>
      <p>Mizuho's net profit for the quarter jumped 53.9% to 245.19 billion yen, representing 40% of its annual profit forecast.</p>
      <p>Japan's biggest lender, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Years of ultra-low interest rates in Japan have meant lenders have little margin for earnings from lending, which has typically translated into a discount for Japanese banking stocks.</p>
      <p>SMFG is trading at a price to book value of 0.7, meaning its shares are trading at a discount to the value of its assets. In comparison, U.S. bank JP Morgan is trading at almost twice the value of its assets, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>The Japanese banks, however, say a full earnings impact will only be felt after the BOJ ends its negative interest rate policy, where it imposes a 0.1% interest rate on a portion of excess reserves banks park with the central bank.</p>
      <p>SMFG said it expects a policy rate increase to 0% would boost its annual net interest income by 30 billion yen.</p>
      <p>While the latest policy change does not necessarily hasten the end of negative interest rates, "normalisation of the policy will come into sight if stable inflation is confirmed," IwaiCosmo's Kawasaki said.</p>

    	<p>Top AI stock Marvell Technology and Eli Lilly lead this weekend's watch list of five stocks near buy points as the new S&P 500 bull market revs back up.</p>
    	<p>Top AI stock Marvell Technology (MRVL) and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (LLY) lead this weekend's watch list of five stocks near buy points as the S&P 500 bull market revs back up. MRVL stock, whose AI chip business is surging, and LLY stock, which is being powered by prospects for its Alzheimer's treatment and weight-loss drugs, are joined by cruise line Carnival (CCL), construction equipment supplier United Rentals (URI) and aerospace contractor TransDigm (TDG).</p>	
    	<p>CCL stock and URI are both part of the flagship IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.</p>	
    	<p>For now, the powerful AI-led stock market rally has found its footing and taken another step forward after some earnings volatility. The S&P 500 finished the week at a 15-month closing high and just 4.5% off its record close on Jan. 3, 2022. The renewed momentum came courtesy of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. He indicated that if benign inflation data in June continues, the Fed may be done hiking.</p>
      <p>Be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and what it means for your trading decisions.</p>
      <h3>MRVL Stock</h3>
      <p>Marvell makes chips used in wireless phone networks, automobiles, industrial systems, data storage devices and data centers.</p>
      <p>MRVL expects its AI chip business to grow to $400 million in fiscal 2024, up from $200 million in fiscal 2023. Then it sees AI sales doubling again in fiscal 2025 to $800 million, reaching about 15% of sales. However, that strength will be partly offset by near-term softness in enterprise networking and data storage.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis highlighted comments by Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on capex and AI spending, saying his firm's "above-consensus" estimates for AI-chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) "may prove conservative." He also sees their commentary as positive for Marvell, among others.</p>
      <p>On July 11, KeyBanc raised its price target for MRVL stock to 80 from 70, highlighting design wins from Amazon (AMZN) and Google.</p>
      <p>MRVL stock rose 1.6% to 64.91 on Friday. Marvell has a 66.81 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, according to MarketSmith. However, a move above Thursday's 66.24 high would constitute a break above the handle downtrend and give investors an entry point just below the official buy point.</p>
      <h3>LLY Stock</h3>
      <p>Eli Lilly stock is riding a wave of good news and optimism over its donanemab Alzheimer's treatment and its Mounjaro type 2 diabetes treatment.</p>
      <p>LLY stock was featured as IBD Stock Of The Day on July 18 after it announced a 29% slower decline in cognition over 18 months for patients who received its experimental drug than for placebo recipients.</p>
      <p>Leering Partners analyst David Risinger predicted FDA approval of donanemab by year-end 2023. Lilly also is hoping to gain approval this year for Mounjaro as a weight-loss drug.</p>
      <p>LLY stock rose 0.8% to 458.48 on Friday. On Wednesday, LLY stock bounced off its 50-day moving average. With Friday's advance, LLY stock is now actionable, though the bounce above the 50-day has come on below-average volume.</p>
      <p>Eli Lilly could be setting up a 469.87 flat-base buy point but needs another week to complete it.</p>
      <h3>CCL Stock</h3>
      <p>Carnival was featured as IBD Stock Of The Day on Thursday, as CCL stock broke a trendline following better-than-expected Q2 results.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, rival Royal Caribbean (RCL) reported big Q2 revenue and earnings beats, highlighting record pricing levels. Carnival reported results for its May fiscal second-quarter in June.</p>
      <p>Recent data indicate little sign that the consumer is growing cautious when it comes to travel.</p>
      <p>On July 11, Carnival's Holland America Line, a luxury cruise line, enjoyed a record day for bookings. "People are planning their vacations for next year and even into 2025, an in the process, they're choosing the best service at sea," Holland America Line president Gus Antorcha said in the news release.</p>
      <p>Investors should note that Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) reports before Tuesday's market open.</p>
      <p>CCL stock rose 1.5% to 18.49 on Friday. After finding support at its 21-day exponential moving average, CCL stock jumped higher late in the week, breaking a down-sloping trendline and offering an aggressive entry point. Investors also could use Thursday's high of 18.81 as an entry.</p>
      <h3>URI Stock</h3>
      <p>United Rentals was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day, as the equipment-rental giant continued to bounce back after an initial selloff following Q2 earnings late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>United Rentals topped estimates with Q2 EPS rising 26% to $9.88 and revenue up 28% to $3.55 billion. The company said its equipment sales surged 133%. Baird analyst Mircea Dobre said that the earnings beat and guidance raise largely reflect the equipment sales, while core rental operations basically matched expectations. But Credit Suisse said that URI's acquisition of Ahern, though a near-term drag, sets the firm up to capitalize on megatrends of infrastructure spending, reshoring of manufacturing and a clean energy boom.</p>
      <p>URI stock tumbled just over 7% Thursday morning following earnings, but rebounded from the 10-week moving average and closed down just 0.7%. On Friday, United Rentals rose 1.1% to 446.07, though, finishing well off its 459.30 high. A move back above Friday's intraday high would break the handle trendline and offer an early entry. URI stock has an official cup-with-handle buy point of 471.82.</p>
      <h3>TDG Stock</h3>
      <p>TransDigm Group comprises 48 companies that produce highly engineered components and systems for nearly all military and commercial aircraft. About 90% of sales are unique, proprietary products, TransDigm says. About 50% to 55% of sales come in the aftermarket.</p>
      <p>On July 6, Citi analyst Jason Gursky started coverage on TDG stock with a buy rating and 1,042 price target. He cited rising global air traffic, the healthy outlook for production of new aircraft and growing defense budgets. He also likes TransDigm's focus on proprietary products, giving it pricing power and margin-expansion potential.</p>
      <p>TDG stock dipped 0.8% to 885.13 on Friday. TDG has now etched out a five-weeks-tight pattern, closing up or down by no more than 1.5% in each of the past four weeks. That has established an 899.97 buy point.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Southwest Airlines flashed a sell signal. At the session low near 329, MSFT stock dipped notably below its sharply rising 50-day moving average and 10-week moving average.</p>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its 13-day winning streak snap in the stock market today, losing 237 points, or almost 0.7%. The 30-stock blue chip index also finished near session lows. Microsoft (MSFT) slumped for the fifth time in seven sessions, falling nearly 2.1%.</p>
      <p>At the session low near 329, MSFT stock dipped notably below its sharply rising 50-day moving average and 10-week moving average.</p>
      <p>A strong bounce off the 50-day line or the 10-week line could furnish a new secondary buy point. Please keep in mind that in terms of buying strategy, the best time to add shares in a winning position is during a confirmed market uptrend.</p>
      <p>The generative AI play and cloud computing giant has blazed a torrid run since its breakout past a pair of proper entry points. One, Microsoft coasted past a narrow flat base with a 276.76 entry back in March.</p>
      <p>Two, Mr. Softy rolled over a 292.08 entry in a handle within its first-stage cup with handle.</p>
      <h3>Inside Dow Jones</h3>	
    	<p>Within the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Honeywell (HON), Microsoft, American Express (AXP) and at least four additional components fell 2 points or more. At Thursday's session high of 35,645, the Dow Jones had gained 7.5% year to date, lagging much more robust gains by the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500.</p>
      <h3>AmEx And Honeywell Produce Sell Signals</h3>	
    	<p>AXP undercut its 50-day line in disappointing fashion. The stock is triggering the golden rule of investing, falling more than 7% below a 177.04 handle buy point following a low-volume breakout earlier in the month.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Honeywell cleaved its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish move that triggers a defensive sell signal.</p>
      <p>Shares finished near their low for the day, down nearly 12 points, or almost 6%. Volume rushed 121% higher than usual levels. The expert in automotive and aerospace systems products posted a 13% rise in second-quarter earnings to $2.38 a share. Revenue inched up 2% to $9.15 billion; growth in the top line decelerated from year-over-year gains of 6% in the prior three quarters.</p>
      <p>Notice on a daily chart how Honeywell's relative strength line has been falling precipitously since early July. This means HON stock has grossly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the Nasdaq eased almost 0.6% after poking to a session high 14,360, up 37% since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 backtracked a little more than 0.6% lower, less than a 1.3% drop by the Russell 2000.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rallied more than 1.2% to close at $79.77 a barrel in the wake of a solid first reading on second-quarter U.S. GDP data. At one point, Nymex crude touched $80.60, the highest point since April 19.</p>
      <p>The U.S. economy rose 2.4% on an annualized basis, boosted in part by a 1.6% increase in personal consumption expenditures. Gasoline futures rose 1.4%, but natural gas fell 3%.</p>
      <p>Investors sold more government securities. The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped 16 basis points to 4.01%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year note's yield last closed above 4% on July 10.</p>
      <h3>Beyond Dow Jones: European Stocks Rally</h3>
      <p>Across the pond, European bourses rallied even after the ECB ratcheted the cost of short-term money by another quarter point. But European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde noted during a news conference that the bank is getting to the stage of weighing the possibility of pausing its monetary tightening campaign that's aimed at quelling inflation.</p>
      <p>The Stoxx Europe 600 jumped nearly 1.4%. It's gained in seven of the past eight trading days and notched a fresh 52-week high.</p>
      <h3>Market Breadth Negative</h3>
      <p>According to Thinkorswim data, falling stocks far exceeded rising ones by a nearly 3-1 margin on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.</p>
      <p>Despite strength in the price of crude oil, oil-related firms cooled off.</p>
      <p>VanEck Oil Services ETF (OIH) slumped 1.5% to 332.62 in light turnover.</p>
      <p>The exchange traded fund is trying to clear a cup without handle that shows a 336.30 buy point.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, iShares Expanded Tech Software ETF (IGV) reversed from early gains to a relatively milder 0.8% drop. Volume dropped 37% below its 50-day average. The fund remains nicely above its rising 21-day exponential moving average.</p>
      <p>IGV has rallied more than 23% since clearing a flat base with a 300.11 entry.</p>
      <h3>Airlines Nose Lower</h3>
      <p>Elsewhere, Southwest Airlines (LUV) flashed a key sell signal. The stock fell 9% in more than quadruple usual turnover and sliced through its rising 50-day moving average, a true sign of weakness.</p>
      <p>Shares sold off hard on Q2 results (net loss of 27 cents per share despite a 22% rise in revenue to $5.71 billion). As seen on a weekly chart, LUV skidded back below a 40-week moving average, a no-no for growth stock pickers.</p>
      <p>Prior to the drop, Southwest's Relative Strength Rating of 57 had already pointed to the stock's middling performance over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>In general, focus on companies that hold an RS Rating of 85 or higher.</p>
      <p>Some new issues may not have 12 months' worth of trading history, but as seen in the case of Cava Group (CAVA), they can still produce excellent relative strength.</p>
      <h3>Beyond Dow Jones: Watch This New IPO</h3>
      <p>Cava, down 3.4% to 49.88 in accelerating turnover on Thursday, priced its initial equity offering at $22 a share. After its IPO, the Mediterranean cuisine-themed fast-casual eatery chain rocketed on its June 15 debut on the NYSE to as high as 47.89. The stock built a narrow IPO base and powered past the 47.89 entry less than four weeks later.</p>
      <p>According to MarketSmith, Cava stock hosts a solid 96 3-month Relative Strength Rating.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, shares rallied more than 2% to a session high 53.25 before pulling back below 50 by day's end. That translated into a solid 11% advance from the entry. It also means CAVA has gotten extended past the 5% buy zone (from 47.89 to 50.28) and thus should not be chased at current price levels.</p>
      <p>At this point, watch for a potential new base to form.</p>
      <p>Cava's revenue climbed 28% to $203.1 million in the first quarter vs. a year earlier. That marked the strongest year-over-year top-line increase in at least five quarters. In the prior four quarters, Cava's top line grew on average 12.8%.</p>
      <p>First-quarter net loss of 2 cents was also the smallest net loss in five quarters.</p>
      <p>Wall Street sees the company losing 8 cents a share for all of 2023 and losing another 6 cents in 2024.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones falls more than 200 points, ending the historic 13-day rally, on investor fears that strong economic data could bring more rate hikes.</p>
    	<p>Plunging almost 300 points over two hours in the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended its 13-session winning streak, missing its chance to set its longest run of gains since 1897. The Dow closed down 0.65% or about 225 points.</p>
      <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Dow Jones falls 0.65%, or 225 points, the first time the index has finished in the red in 14 sessions.</li>
        <li>Dow Chemical rises 2%, while McDonalds moves higher by 1.4% on an earnings report beat.</li>
        <li>Honeywell plunges more than 5% as revenue falls short of projections.</li>
      </ul>	
    	<p>Other stock indexes joined the Dow in moving downward. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6% and the Nasdaq fell 0.5%, as investors processed more positive economic news, including a U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) that showed the economy was growing faster than expectations. Investors worried economic growth could prompt even more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <h3>On the Upswing</h3>	
      <p>Dow Chemical (DOW) rose 2%, climbing for the third-straight session since its second-quarter earnings report beat estimates, thanks to lower costs.</p>
      <p>McDonald's (MCD) shares were up 1.4% after its earnings report beat revenue and profit estimates, but the company signaled sales would slow in the second half of the year. McDonald’s earnings of $3.17 a share were above estimates of $2.78, but its chief financial officer told investors on a call that revenue was expected to moderate.</p>
      <p>Intel (INTC) shares rose 0.4% ahead of its earnings report release after markets close.</p>
      <h3>On the Downside</h3>
    	<p>Honeywell International (HON) tumbled 5% after the conglomerate’s earnings and full-year outlook were modestly above analysts' expectations. However, revenue fell to slightly lower than projections. The aerospace and building technologies provider reported revenue of $9.1 billion, less than the $9.2 billion analysts had forecast. Its earnings of $2.23 a share came in higher than the $2.21 analysts were looking to see.</p>
      <p>American Express (AXP) dropped 2.2% following its $15 million settlement for its business-card sales practices after a Piper Sandler analyst raised concerns over how the resumption of student loan repayments could drag down the stock.</p>
      <p>Microsoft (MSFT) shares dropped 2.4%, while Verizon (VZ) moved lower by 2.2%. Procter & Gamble (PG) shares traded 0.9% lower ahead of its earnings report on Friday.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- European stocks were subdued at the start of the busiest week of the earnings season, with investors also awaiting key central bank policy meetings. Spanish stocks fell after an inconclusive election outcome.</p>
    	<p>The Stoxx 600 was little changed at the close, with media and technology stocks underperforming. Telecom and energy stocks gained. Spain’s IBEX 35 Index closed 0.3% lower.</p>	
    	<p>“We expect markets to remain in a holding pattern until mid-week when the Fed and then the ECB publish their rate decisions,” said Joachim Klement, head of strategy, accounting and sustainability at Liberum Capital. “We think the central banks will hint at an end to their rate hikes, which should support markets significantly.”</p>	
    	<p>A rally in European stocks has lost steam this month amid worries about central banks remaining hawkish for longer. Investors will hear from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank this week, with both central banks expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. Focus will remain on any clues about further rate hikes as US inflation slows while the labor market remains resilient.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the second-quarter earnings season kicks into high gear this week as Stoxx 600 companies with a combined market value of $6.8 trillion are scheduled to report results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists said they expect firms to beat the low bar for the quarter, but guidance might be tougher to raise given a loss of momentum and disappointing economic data from China.</p>
      <p>Growth worries are also increasing, as data showed the euro-area private-sector economy contracted more than anticipated in July, with order inflows and output expectations pointing to the downturn deepening in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Among individual movers, Ryanair Holdings Plc dropped after the carrier lowered its full-year traffic prediction and said it may need to cut ticket prices to fill seats this winter as passengers become more cost sensitive. Vodafone Group Plc rallied as it reported first-quarter service revenue growth that beat analysts’ expectations.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>One of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" stocks, Meta Platforms, dodges the pending changes, says an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group. Meta's weight in the Nasdaq 100 will actually rise slightly. The Nasdaq 100 owns the 100 most-valuable nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq.</p>
    	<p>The Nasdaq 100 — one of the best-known and top-performing stock indexes — gets shaken up today. And some of the changes from the "special rebalance" might surprise you.</p>	
    	<p>The biggest surprise of all? One of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" stocks, Meta Platforms (META), dodges the pending changes, says an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group. Meta's weight in the Nasdaq 100 will actually rise slightly.</p>	
    	<p>The stock skates through the rebalance's rules designed to limit the weight of the dominant stocks in the index. The Nasdaq 100 owns the 100 most-valuable nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>This twist shows just how difficult it is to tame the outsize influence this group of stocks is having on markets, says Robert Maltbie, fund manager of Argonaut 2000 Partners. "Everyone is wrapped around these seven stocks," he said.</p>
      <h3>Apple Isn't The Top Nasdaq 100 Change</h3>
      <p>What's prompting the rare special rebalance in the Nasdaq 100? It's triggered when all the Nasdaq 100 stocks with individual 4.5% market value weights collectively account for 48% or more of the index.</p>
      <p>And that happened on July 3, with six stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA). Together they accounted for 50.9% of the Nasdaq, Bespoke found. It's the third time since 1998 this rebalance happened.</p>
      <p>And this raises another surprise. Apple isn't the stock to see the largest weighting cut in the Nasdaq 100. That's surprising as Apple is the most valuable stock in the Nasdaq 100, valued at roughly $3 trillion. But its weighting in the index is only falling 2.66 percentage points from its July 3 level, Bespoke said.</p>
      <p>That's smaller than the 2.74 percentage point drop by Microsoft. The software giant's weight in the Nasdaq 100 is dropping to 10.06 from 12.8. Microsoft's big weighting cut is a remnant of the last Nasdaq 100 special rebalance during the tech rally of the late 1990s. At that point, Microsoft alone accounted for a quarter of the Nasdaq 100.</p>
      <h3>Meta Platforms' Weight Rises (A Little)</h3>
      <p>Why is Meta spared the kneecapping applied to the others? It's all about timing.</p>
      <p>On July 3, the social media giant only accounted for 4.2% of the Nasdaq 100. That's just below the 4.5% balance threshold. There's the interesting part. Since Meta isn't directly part of the rebalance, its weight would increase to 5% as the other six giants' weights are cut. But Nasdaq's rules cap weightings at 4.4%, which will be Meta's new weight, Bespoke says.</p>
      <h3>The Nasdaq 100 Will Still Be Top Heavy</h3>
      <p>Even after the special rebalancing, though, the Nasdaq will still hinge on just a few giant stocks.</p>
      <p>The six most-valuable stocks on the Nasdaq 100 will still account for 40% of the index following the changes. That's down from 50.9% on July 3, but still "very concentrated," Maltbie says. And that exposes the index to risk, as many of the Magnificent Seven stocks are extended past historical averages.</p>
      <p>"The Magnificent Seven has created a statistical aberration," he said.</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq 100 Tends To Perform Fine Following Special Rebalances</h3>
      <p>You might think these special rebalances might take the wind out of the Nasdaq 100's sails. But that's not true historically: The index tends to do fine following these events.</p>
      <p>Following the 1998 rebalance, the tech boom continued. The Nasdaq soared 112% in the 12 months following that rebalance, Bespoke found. And even following the May 2011 special rebalance, the Nasdaq 100 rose another 9%.</p>
      <p>"The 9% gain a year later isn't so bad," Bespoke said. "Based on these historical examples, the Nasdaq's special rebalance doesn't signal doom or a major reversal for the market; if anything, a continuation of recent trends is the signal sent by limited precedent."</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Chevron surprised markets Sunday, releasing better-than-expected second-quarter figures early, along with changes to its leadership structure.</p>
    	<p>Chevron (CVX) surprised the markets Sunday, releasing earlier-than-expected second-quarter numbers and announcing the oil giant's chief financial officer is stepping down in 2024. CVX angled higher early Monday.</p>	
    	<p>Chevron topped Wall Street profit estimates, even as earnings dropped nearly 50%. The U.S. oil major also announced it waived the mandatory retirement age of 65 for Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth, 62, and that Chief Financial Offer Pierre Breber will retire next year.</p>	
    	<p>Eimear Bonner, currently the vice president and chief technology officer at Chevron, will succeed Breber on March 1, 2024, according to the company.</p>
      <p>Chevron earnings per share fell 47% to $3.08. Analysts expected earnings of $2.91 per share. Chevron will still release full second-quarter results on Friday, when ExxonMobil (XOM) also reports.</p>
      <p>CVX rose 2.3% t 162.38 early Monday during market trade. On Friday, Chevron stock gained 1.5% to 158.69. The Dow Jones component is down 12% in 2023.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures rose to $77.65 per barrel Monday, the highest in three months on expectations of stronger demand in China and a tighter global supply outlook.</p>
      <p>Last year, as the U.S. economy bounced from Covid pandemic retreat to inflation-driven growth, Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The combination sent oil, gasoline and natural gas prices soaring. This resulted in Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other energy stocks leading the market, with the companies racking up record profits.</p>
      <h3>Chevron Earnings Details</h3>
      <p>The energy giant announced Sunday in its second-quarter "performance highlights" that production in the Permian Basin set a quarterly record. Chevron reported production totaled 772,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and that Permian production is track with full-year guidance.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chevron's net oil equivalent production so far in 2023 is running flat vs. 2022, totaling 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
      <p>Chevron added it returned $7.2 billion to shareholders in Q2, with $2.8 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in stock purchases.</p>
      <p>The company also said it expects its $6.3 billion deal to acquire PDC Energy (PDCE) to close in August.</p>
      <p>In Q1, Chevron topped Wall Street estimates, even as revenue slipped compared to a year ago. Earnings gained 6% to $3.55 per share in the first quarter. Sales dropped 6% to $50.79 billion. Higher margins on refined product sales drove the earning beat, the company said, partially offset by lower oil prices and rising production costs.</p>
      <p>Chevron reported worldwide net oil-equivalent production of 2.98 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in Q1. That's down 3% compared to last year, primarily due to lower international production, the company said.</p>
      <h3>ExxonMobil Earnings On The Way</h3>
      <p>Estimates: Analysts predict Exxon earnings slipping 50% to $2.04 per share with revenue decreasing 30% to $81.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Results: Check early Friday.</p>
      <p>ExxonMobil stock edged up 1.9% to 105.84 early Monday. XOM closed Friday trading at 103.89. Shares are currently in consolidation and sitting around 15% below a 119.92 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.</p>
      <p>In Q1, ExxonMobil earnings jumped 36% to $2.83 per share with revenue slipping 4% to $86.56 billion.</p>
      <p>The company's net production in the first quarter was 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day up 4% from last year. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil's upstream earnings totaled $6.5 billion in Q1, a 20% drop compared to the fourth-quarter 2022, but a 45% jump from last year.</p>
      <p>Exxon reported the main drivers of this sequential quarterly drop was lower prices, with crude and natural gas realizations down 10% and 23%, respectively.</p>
      <p>ExxonMobil stock has a 59 Composite Rating of 99. XOM shares have a 49 Relative Strength Rating and a 76 EPS Rating.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The major indexes hit new 52-week highs, but did pare morning gains. Tesla fell late as Elon Musk spoke on the earnings call. Netflix sold off late.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures edged higher early Thursday, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures fell modestly. Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) headlined earnings overnight.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market rally closed off Wednesday's best levels, but the major indexes finished in positive territory after hitting fresh 52-week highs in the market. Market breadth was strong once again, but a number of leading stocks erased gains or reversed lower. The Nasdaq remains extended.</p>
      <p>Apple (AAPL) hit a record high Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that it's built an internal generative AI chatbot for its employees, known as Ajax. AAPL stock backed off but still closed slightly higher. The midday news knocked fellow Dow Jones giant Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), though the chatbot leaders came off intraday lows.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock fell solidly in overnight trading after Tesla EPS and sales topped views, though operating profit missed. Shares lost ground during the earnings call as Elon Musk said that concerns about falling profit margins will "look silly" as Tesla achieves full self-driving.</p>
      <p>NFLX stock tumbled in premarket trading as Netflix subscriber growth easily beat views but revenue came in light.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Discover Financial (DFS), IBM (IBM) and United Airlines (UAL) also reported Wednesday night. United Air and Las Vegas Sands beat views while Discover and IBM stock missed on earnings. UAL stock popped, signaling a move to the top of the buy range. IBM stock edged lower. DFS stock dived, signaling a drop well below a buy point. LVS stock fell, back toward the 50-day.</p>
      <p>Early Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), D.R. Horton (DHI), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and American Airlines (AAL) topped views. TSM stock fell modestly and American Air dipped, while JNJ stock and D.R. Horton rose.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla stock is on IBD Leaderboard, with UAL stock on the Leaderboard watchlist. Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value, with JNJ stock providing a slim lift. S&P 500 futures retreated 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.5%. Tesla stock and Netflix are notable S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 components.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 3.79%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil prices just edged higher, but copper futures jumped nearly 2%.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally closed off highs but slightly higher.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% in Wednesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite ended just above break-even. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.45%.</p>
      <p>Apple stock edged up 0.7% to 195.10, after hitting a record 198.23 shortly after midday on the chatbot report. MSFT stock fell 1.2%. Shares popped 4% Tuesday, clearing a short consolidation, as Microsoft announced pricing for enterprise AI tools. Google stock sank 1.4%, moving back toward the 50-day line in a flat base.</p>
      <p>Market breadth was strong, as financials continued to rally and telecoms rebounded for a second straight day.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) rose 0.5%, closing in on its 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) edged up 0.1% while the Nasdaq 100 was fractionally lower.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq is 8.2% above its 50-day moving average with the Nasdaq 100 8.7%. Those are stretched, raising the odds of a market pullback. A lot of highly speculative growth names surging in recent days points to increasing froth.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell 0.5% to $75.35 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield slid 5 basis points to 3.73%, testing the 50-day line.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 1.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) edged up 0.1%, with MSFT stock a major IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) lost 1.05%.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) climbed 1.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 1.1%. TSLA stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) both dipped 0.3%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 0.8%, with UAL stock and American Air major holdings. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) closed fractionally lower. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) rose 0.6% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) climbed 0.5%.</p>
      <p>The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) edged lower.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 0.4%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) jumped 3.1%</p>
      <h3>Tesla Earnings</h3>
      <p>Tesla earnings came in at 91 cents a share, up 20% vs. a year earlier while comfortably beating views for 80 cents. That was helped by a 9-cent non-operating gain, largely favorable currency swings. Operating income of $2.4 billion missed views for $2.7 billion and fell 2.6% vs. a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Revenue jumped 47% to $24.93 billion, slightly topping. In Q2 2022, Tesla Shanghai was shut for Covid lockdowns for several weeks while the Berlin and Austin plants were slowing picking up production.</p>
      <p>Free cash flow was just over $1 billion, far short of consensus for $1.88 billion.</p>
      <p>While deliveries hit a record high in Q2, inventories increased as production once again exceeded sales.</p>
      <p>Gross margin fell to 18.2% from 19.3% in Q1 and 25% a year earlier, as Tesla continued to cut prices and offer other incentives to push up vehicle sales.</p>
      <p>On the Tesla earnings call, investors wanted signs that gross margins would bottom out soon.</p>
      <p>But on the call, CEO Elon Musk "short-term variances in gross margins" aren't important when "autonomy" vastly expands Tesla's profitability. That suggests Musk isn't concerned about further margin declines. Despite Musk's year forecasts, most autonomy experts say Tesla Full Self-Driving is far from achieving full self-driving.</p>
      <p>Tesla said it's in talks to license FSD to a major automaker.</p>
      <p>Tesla said in the earnings report that the "Cybertruck remains on track to begin initial production later this year at Gigafactory Texas." On Saturday, Tesla showed a photo of an Austin-made Cybertruck, but the Q2 earnings release suggests that it wasn't made on the production line.</p>
      <p>Potential buyers still don't know what Cybertruck prices, battery range and other key specs will be. The Tesla earnings call had nothing on that.</p>
      <p>There was also scant information about an upcoming Model 3 upgrade and possibly real hints on a future, next-generation model.</p>
      <p>Musk did say Tesla will cut production over the summer for factory upgrades. Output has exceeded deliveries for several quarters, even with production already well below capacity.</p>
      <p>He expects 1.8 million deliveries in 2023, the first such forecast for the EV maker.</p>
      <p>Musk also said that the Optimus Bot should perform some meaningful work in Tesla factories next year.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock fell more than 3% in overnight trade.</p>
      <p>Shares reversed lower on Wednesday to close down 0.7% to 291.26. But shares are up 3.5% so far this week. TSLA stock has surged 137% in 2023, and is working toward a 313.80 buy point from a very deep cup base going back nearly 10 months.</p>
      <h3>Netflix Earnings</h3>
      <p>Netflix subscribers grew by 5.9 million in Q2, easily beating estimates of 1.8 million, as a password-sharing crackdown takes hold. The internet streaming giant now has 238.39 million paying customers worldwide.</p>
      <p>Netflix earnings topped views but revenue came in light. The company also guided to mixed Q3 results.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect Netflix earnings to fall 12% vs. a year earlier, with revenue up 4% to $8.27 billion</p>
      <p>NFLX stock slumped more than 5% early Thursday. Shares rose 0.6% to 477.59 on Wednesday after popping 5.5% on Tuesday. Hollywood production is shut down with writers and now actors on strike.</p>
      <p>But Netflix is well positioned with a deep content library, offering customers plenty of shows and movies to watch even as rivals face shrinking pipelines in the coming months. It raised its free cash flow evidence, citing reduced spending due to the strike.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The past few days have been a good time to let your existing positions work. The major indexes keep rising, with leading stocks outperforming. Some are still flashing buy signals, but the odds of a market pullback are growing.</p>
      <p>An extended, frothy market heading into the full force of earnings season carries heightened risks, especially for growth stocks.</p>
      <p>A pullback might not be a big deal for positions held for weeks or months, but new buys could quickly come under pressure.</p>
      <p>When a market rally has been doing well for weeks and your portfolio is racking up big gains, it's easy to get cocky. Remember, you're not any smarter than you were a month ago. Keep your ego and emotions in check.</p>
      <p>Keep working on watchlists and pay attention to key earnings for your holdings.</p>

    	<p>By Chuck Mikolajczak</p>
    	<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell on Thursday, weighed down by drops in Tesla and Netflix following their quarterly results, but the Dow advanced for a ninth straight day thanks to gains in Johnson & Johnson following a strong annual forecast.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla's shares tumbled 9.74%, its biggest one-day percentage drop since April 20, after the electric-vehicle maker reported a drop in its second-quarter gross margins to a four-year low and CEO Elon Musk hinted at more price cuts.</p>
      <p>Netflix slumped 8.41% to suffer its biggest one-day percentage decline since December 15, after the streaming video company's quarterly revenue fell short of estimates.</p>
      <p>"The news last night in Tesla and Netflix, while it’s not the end of the world does give people a reason to wake up and go 'wow, maybe I shouldn’t be chasing these names up here,'" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.</p>
      <p>"Let me take some money off the table and redeploy it into big boring names."</p>
      <p>The Dow, however, was able to climb as Johnson & Johnson gained 6.07% after reporting results and announcing an annual profit forecast raise.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 163.97 points, or 0.47%, to 35,225.18, the S&P 500 lost 30.85 points, or 0.68%, to 4,534.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 294.71 points, or 2.05%, to 14,063.31.</p>
      <p>The decline for the Nasdaq was its largest one-day percentage fall since March 9, while the Dow registered its ninth straight session of gains, its longest winning streak since September 2017.</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq has surged 34.4% this year to levels not seen since early April 2022, supported by a seemingly unstoppable rally in megacap growth names such as Nvidia and Meta on optimism over the potential of artificial intelligence, a U.S. economy that has proven more resilient than many anticipated and expectations the end of then Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike cycle was on the horizon.</p>
      <p>The S&P technology, communication services and consumer discretionary sectors each dropped at least 2% on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Tech shares saw additional pressure after business software maker SAP trimmed its full-year outlook for cloud revenue U.S. listed shares of SAP closed down 6.34%.</p>
      <p>Economic data on Thursday indicated the labor market remains tight, while the housing and manufacturing sectors continue to slump.</p>
      <p>United Airlines advanced 3.23% after lifting its full-year profit outlook and posted its highest ever quarterly earnings on booming demand for international travel.</p>
      <p>With 77 S&P 500 companies having reported results through Thursday morning, second-quarter earnings are expected to have declined 7.9%, Refinitiv data showed, more than the 5.7% fall expected at the start of the month.</p>
      <p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.16 billion shares, compared with the 10.6 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Nasdaq Inc. became the latest mainstream financial firm to take a step back from digital assets, aborting its launch of a custodian business in the US due to the shifting business and regulatory environment.</p>
    	<p>The exchange operator is also halting its efforts to pursue a license related to the business but will continue to build out its technology to handle crypto for clients.</p>	
    	<p>"We remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem in a variety of ways,” including partnerships with potential ETF issuers, Adena Friedman, Nasdaq’s chief executive officer, said on the second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Nasdaq pulled back amid a widening crackdown by regulators that aims to isolate crypto’s risks from the US financial system. Banks have been warned about their exposure to crypto businesses, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a series of lawsuits against some of the industry’s biggest firms, including Binance and Coinbase Global Inc.</p>
      <p>Among the concerns are risks that could topple a federally insured bank, as well as the failure of some crypto platforms to separate different parts of their businesses, such as custody, market-making and trading, which could result in conflicts of interests.</p>	
    	<p>“We do like to be able to operate in a pretty well-regulated environment and a well-understood regulatory framework, and right now that regulatory framework is changing,” Friedman said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “So we decided to halt those efforts right now and really just focus in on the tech business and on the listings business,” adding that any return to the business would depend upon “what the regulatory framework looks like.”</p>
      <p>Nasdaq has already built the products needed for the crypto custody business, Friedman said, and is “now productizing them to be able to sell to other market operators.”</p>
      <p>Last September, Nasdaq announced plans to offer custody services for Bitcoin and Ether for institutional investors and has applied to get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. A representative from the agency didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>Nasdaq’s previous move toward entering that business was seen as a sign that Wall Street institutions were deepening engagement with digital assets. It had planned to launch the service by the end of the second quarter. Most recently, Nasdaq partnered with BlackRock Inc. to apply for an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Bank of New York Mellon, which has launched a crypto custody services, said that the product has “never been the main focus for us in our digital assets journey,” CEO Robin Vince said on a media call Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Nasdaq said its decision to halt the US custody business will have a “modest financial impact” by contributing to a decrease in its full-year expense growth guidance.</p>
      <p>Nasdaq has been focused on diversifying its revenue sources beyond the exchange business where shares in public companies trade. It’s made investments in software, data and other offerings. The company also provides software for those in the crypto industry, including surveillance and trading tools.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Exchange operator Nasdaq today said it was halting its plans to launch a digital assets custodian service, citing the current regulatory environment in the States.</p>
    	<p>But during its second-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said that the company would “remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem.”</p>	
    	<p>News dropped last year that Nasdaq was planning to launch its own crypto custody service to capture institutional investor interest. But this year, American regulators have launched their toughest crackdown on the industry yet—suing a number of major crypto brands.</p>	
    	<p>“This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the U.S., we’ve made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue a relevant license,” Friedman said.</p>
      <p>She added that the company would continue to engage with regulators and partner with exchange-traded fund issuers working to release crypto products.</p>
      <p>The U.S. is becoming a difficult place for the crypto industry to do business.</p>
      <p>Wall Street’s top regulator, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, has cracked down on crypto exchanges, mainly because he alleges they have been selling unregistered securities.</p>
      <p>Gensler even said regarding the industry: “We don’t need more digital currency.”</p>
      <p>Though despite this, there does appear to be institutional interest in the space: BlackRock—and a number of other major asset managers—have applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF product.</p>
      <p>Nasdaq has teamed up with BlackRock for the application, which is currently being reviewed by the SEC.</p>
      <p>And a new crypto exchange aimed at big money investors, EDX Markets, launched last month. It’s backed by major Wall Street firms Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin, the biggest digital asset by market cap, which is today priced at $29,839, is also up 80% since the start of the year, when it was trading for less than $17,000 per coin.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The major indexes set fresh 52-week highs as earnings roll in. Carvana spiked on results and a debt restructuring. Tesla and Netflix earnings are on tap.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones rose modestly Wednesday, along with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq, after Microsoft (MSFT) lifted the major indexes to 52-week highs Tuesday. Meanwhile, Carvana (CVNA) and ASML (ASML) headlined earnings reports before the open.</p>
      <p>Carvana surged early Wednesday on strong results, guidance and a debt-restructuring deal. ASML missed views but raised its outlook. The Dutch chip-equipment giant fell solidly, moving below a buy point.</p>
      <p>Halliburton (HAL) reported mixed results while fellow oil services giant Baker Hughes (BKR) slightly beat. Superregional bank U.S. Bancorp (USB) narrowly exceeded forecasts, while Dow giant Goldman Sachs (GS) missed on earnings.</p>
      <p>HAL stock fell slightly and Baker Hughes edged higher. U.S. Bancorp and GS stock climbed modestly.</p>
      <p>All eyes will turn to Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) earnings after the close. Both are releasing second-quarter results.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla stock rose slightly early Wednesday, with Cathie Wood's Ark Invest continuing to trim its holdings Tuesday. NFLX stock edged higher.</p>	
    	<p>ASML and TSLA stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders. ASML stock is on the IBD 50.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones rose 0.5%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4%, with the Nasdaq up 0.4%.</p>
      <p>Big telecom issues, led by Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T,) were rebounding sharply after a three-week sell-off tied to lead sheathing used in telecom cables.</p>
      <p>Among tech titans, Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and MSFT stock were little changed.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures rose more than 1%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped 1 basis point to 3.78%.</p>
      <p>U.S. housing starts fell 8% in June to an annual rate of 1.434 million units from May's downwardly revised 1.559 million. Economists expected 1.48 million. Building permits also came in lower than expected.</p>
      <p>Overnight, the U.K. inflation rate fell to a still-hot 7.9% in June from May's 8.7%. Analysts had expected a milder drop to 8.2%. Core inflation unexpectedly cooled slightly to 6.9% from May's 31-year high of 7.1%.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally Tuesday</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.1% in Tuesday's stock market trading, hitting a 52-week high. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite 0.8%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil prices rose 2.2% to $75.75 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked down 1 basis point to 3.79%.</p>
      <h3>ASML Earnings</h3>
      <p>ASML earnings leapt 48% while revenue rose 35%, both beating analyst views. The Dutch maker of high-end chip equipment also guided higher on third-quarter sales and raised its 2023 revenue target.</p>
      <p>ASML stock lost 4% Wednesday, dropping below a buy point. Shares edged up 0.3% on Tuesday to 757.03, slightly above a 747.13 buy point from a flat base, base-on-base pattern.</p>
      <p>ASML stock is a notable holding in the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH).</p>
      <h3>Carvana Earnings</h3>
      <p>Carvana reported second-quarter revenue fell 23.5% to $2.97 billion, but comfortably beat views. Gross per unit spiked 94% to $6,520.</p>
      <p>The used-car dealer, which late Tuesday moved up results from Aug. 3, said it expects to achieve positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, in the third quarter. Carvana also announced a deal to cut debt by $1.2 billion.</p>
      <p>CVNA stock surged more than 30% in volatile trade.</p>
      <p>Carvana stock has skyrocketed 740% in 2023 through July 18. It remains heavily shorted.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Earnings</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock rose nearly 2% Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Shares climbed 4.25% from Monday through Tuesday as the electric-vehicle giant touted its first Cybertruck, made in Austin, Texas.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock has a 313.80 buy point from a very deep cup base, but a meaningful handle or pause would come in handy.</p>
      <p>Tesla earnings are expected to rise 4% vs. a year earlier to 80 cents a share. Revenue should jump 43% to $24.22 billion, Tesla's Shanghai plant was shut down for several weeks in the second quarter of 2022 due to Covid lockdowns.</p>
      <p>Ongoing price cuts and incentives pushed deliveries to a new record in the second quarter. But that likely pressured gross margins further. Tesla's gross profit margin was 19.3% in first quarter, down from 23.8% in the fourth quarter and 29.1% in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
      <p>Investors will be interested when the Cybertruck ramps up production and deliveries, as well as when an upgraded Model 3 hits the streets.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock remains the No. 1 holding across Cathie Wood's Ark Invest ETFs. But Ark Invest has been paring its stake in recent days and weeks. It sold $8.4 million worth of Tesla stock on Tuesday after unloading $13.1 million on Monday.</p>
      <h3>Netflix Earnings</h3>
      <p>NFLX stock climbed 1% Wednesday. Netflix subscribers likely grew by 1.8 million in the second quarter, after the streamer ended the first quarter with 232.5 million paying customers worldwide. Analysts expect Netflix earnings to fall 12% vs. a year earlier, with revenue up 4% to $8.27 billion.</p>
      <p>Netflix stock popped 5.5% on Tuesday to 474.80, its highest level since January 2022. Shares decisively cleared a messy, short-term consolidation.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Apple stock dipped 0.4% early Wednesday. The iPhone giant edged down 0.1% to 193.73 on Tuesday. That's just below AAPL stock's June 30 all-time high of 194.48.</p>
      <p>Microsoft stock edged up 0.3% Wednesday. Shares jumped 4% on Tuesday 359.49, clearing a four-week consolidation to a fresh record high. On Tuesday, the Dow tech titan announced pricing for artificial intelligence tools.</p>
      <p>Microsoft 365 Copilot will cost $30 a month for enterprise customers, on top of their existing subscriptions. Microsoft also will use Meta's new AI large language model, Llama 2, via its Azure cloud-computing service.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Microsoft and Activision (ATVI) agreed to extend their deal deadline to Oct. 18, providing a little more space to clear final regulatory hurdles.</p>
      <p>Microsoft earnings for its fiscal third quarter are set for July 25. Apple's fiscal second-quarter results come on Aug. 3.</p>
      <h3>Internet Giants Google, Meta</h3>
      <p>Google stock climbed 0.3% early Wednesday. Shares edged down 0.7% to 123.76. GOOGL stock is working on a 129.04 buy point from a short base, but could be working on a handle. On July 13, Google stock gapped above its 50-day line, also breaking a trendline. That offered an early entry.</p>
      <p>The internet search giant is restricting some employees' access to the Internet to limit cybersecurity risks, CNBC reported Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Meta stock edged up 0.7%. Shares rose 0.5% on Tuesday to 312.05. The social media giant hit a 52-week high of 316.24 last week.  Meta stock is on track for its ninth-straight monthly gain in a near-vertical advance.</p>
      <p>Google earnings are due July 25, with Meta on tap July 26.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>S&P 500 stocks Advanced Micro Devices and Arista Networks along with Roger Federer-backed On Holding, Cloudflare and Shift4 Payments are in focus this week. With the market in a confirmed uptrend and S&P 500 hitting a fresh 14-month high, this past week was a good time for investors to add exposure. Out of these five, ONON stock is on IBD Leaderboard.</p>
	    <p>However, with the Nasdaq looking extended, the risk of another market pullback has returned. Several of the stocks on this list fell back Friday as major indexes pared gains.</p>	
	    <p>Meanwhile, the market is sure to get shaken up this coming week as earnings season picks up steam, with Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) on tap.</p>	
	    <p>Against this backdrop, investors should keep tabs on these five stocks that are trading around buy points. Out of these five, ONON stock is on IBD Leaderboard. On Holding and ANET are on SwingTrader and the IBD 50. Cloudflare was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Stocks: Advanced Micro Devices Stock</h3>
      <p>AMD rose as high as 122.12 during Friday's market trade, bouncing from its 21-day and 10-week lines, clearing steep trendline and the July 5 high of 117.66. But shares essentially erased gains, closing up 2 cents to 115.94. For the week, AMD stock did rise 2.45%, in the middle of its range.</p>
	    <p>Investors could still use 117.66 as a buy point, but Friday's high may ultimately be the better bet.</p>	
	    <p>The S&P 500 chip giant is competing with Nvidia (NVDA) as the AI chip leader. Nvidia stock and AMD have tended to trade off chip leadership in recent years, and that could happen again. However, currently Nvidia is the leader with AMD lagging somewhat.</p>	
	    <p>Last month, the chipmaker unveiled its latest semiconductor and data center products optimized for artificial intelligence. AMD's AI moves are positioning the chipmaker to take advantage of what will be a $150 billion total addressable market opportunity in the data center market by 2027.</p>
      <p>The market will be about $30 billion in 2023, according to the company.</p>
	    <p>On Wednesday, TD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay raised the firm's AMD price target on 135 from 115. Ramsay kept an outperform rating on the S&P 500 component. Ramsay wrote he believes investors are prepared for mixed Q2 and Q3 reports as the macro economic environment remains challenging.</p>	
	    <p>Advanced Micro Devices stock has a 92 Composite Rating out of 99. The S&P 500 stock has a 95 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating is for the stock 72 out of 99.</p>	
	    <h3>Cloudflare Stock</h3>
      <p>NET fell 1.6% to 66.54 on Friday, reversing lower near a buy point. Cloudflare has formed a flat base with a 72 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The current flat base is directly next to the stock's previous valid base.</p>
      <p>NET stock briefly cleared a trendline and moved above Wednesday's high of 69.61 intraday.</p>
	    <p>Started in 2009, San Francisco-based Cloudflare speeds up and provides security for web applications routed through its global network.</p>	
	    <p>The cybersecurity play took a hit Wednesday as Microsoft (MSFT) expanded its product offerings, putting pressure on Cloudflare and other cybersecurity stocks. Cloudflare stock was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>	
	    <p>But for the week, NET stock jumped 6.7%, rebounding from the 10-week line.</p>
      <p>On April 28, Cloudflare plunged 21% after the company reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates while revenue roughly met expectations. But the company also gave a weak June-quarter and full-year 2023 revenue outlook. Shares have been on the rebound since early May.</p>
	    <p>Cloudflare reported earning 8 cents a share in Q1, up from a 1-cent profit a year earlier. Revenue climbed 37% to $290.2 million.</p>	
	    <p>NET has a perfect 99 Composite Rating. Cloudflare stock has a 89 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating for NET is 80 out of 99.</p>	
	    <h3>Shift4 Payments Stock</h3>
      <p>FOUR fell 3.2% to 67.13 on Friday, back below a key resistance level around 69. Shares rose in higher volume in the prior two sessions, closing above the 69 area on Thursday, but FOUR stock ended on both days. On a positive note, Friday's slide came on light trade, while FOUR stock bounced slightly from the 21-day line.</p>
      <p>For the week, shares climbed 1.5%, but in the lower third of its range.</p>
	    <p>At this point, investors may want to see if Shift4 Payments stock forms a handle based on Thursday's high of 71.03. The current official buy point is 86.40.</p>	
	    <p>Shift4 Payments is an independent provider of payment acceptance and payment processing technology solutions in the U.S. It's payment processing includes credit, debit, contactless card, and QR pay among other alternative payment methods.</p>	
	    <p>On Thursday, Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Shift4 Payments sock to 88 from 90. Analyst Will Nance maintained a buy rating on the shares with expectations of a mixed outlook for consumer spending and payments companies for the remainder of the year.</p>
	    <p>In May, the company reported better-than-expected Q1 financials. Shift4 Payments saw EPS skyrocket 240% to 51 cents. Revenue grew 34% to $200 million.</p>	
	    <p>The stock has a 93 Composite Rating. FOUR has a 91 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating for FOUR is 82.</p>	
      <h3>On Holding Stock</h3>
      <p>ONON slipped 1.2% to 33.14 Friday, just below a valid buy point. But shares jumped 5.4% for the week.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, ONON advanced above a trendline entry but failed to close above a 33.67 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stocks finished mixed on Friday but ended the week up as upbeat results from JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) lifted those big banks' stocks and new survey data showed Americans are becoming increasingly confident in the economy.</p>
    	<p>Banks helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which added about 0.3% as quarterly earnings from Wall Street names started rolling in. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both finished slightly below the flatline. All of the major averages finished</p>	
    	<p>Investors were weighing quarterly updates from the financial sector, with the focus on any signs of impact from this spring's bank failures and the subsequent draining of deposits across the system.</p>	
    	<p>JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares were on the rise after they both reported a surge in profits in the second quarter. Meanwhile, BlackRock (BLK) stock slipped after its revenue fell year over year.</p>
      <p>All the major benchmarks look on track for weekly wins after signs that inflation is cooling and that the labor market is robust have lifted hopes that a strong economy can give stocks momentum to run higher after a stellar start to the year.</p>
      <h3>Stocks close mixed, Dow leads on bank earnings</h3>
      <p>After initially rallying to start the day, stocks closed mixed on Friday as strong bank results carried the Dow (^DJI) higher while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed in the red by about 0.1% each.</p>
      <p>For the week, though, all three of the major averages closed higher as companies largely welcomed in earnings season with better-than-expected results and economic data showed consumers feeling more confident about easing inflation.</p>
      <h3>Hollywood double strike is yet another headwind for media companies</h3>
      <p>The actors strike is the latest challenge to hit media companies grappling with a consumer shift to streaming services.</p>
      <p>As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, Hollywood's double strike will likely pressure major media companies as the production pipeline grinds to a complete halt. SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — joined writers on the picket lines early Friday after the guild failed to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Disney (DIS), Netflix (NLFX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and NBCUniversal (CMCSA).</p>
      <p>"We’ve been hearing that most streaming companies won’t feel the pain from strikes until 2024 given the pipeline of content that has already been locked in," said Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley.</p>
      <p>"However, streamers could be in trouble as soon as the velocity of content slows," he warned. "Our experts emphasize that content is still king and if streamers want subscribers to keep coming back, they need to have a steady feed of new movies and shows being released on their platforms."</p>
      <h3>Disney CEO Bob Iger suggests selling TV assets — but who will buy?</h3>
      <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger (DIS) said Thursday he would take an "expansive" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, signaling the potential for strategic options that could include a sale.</p>
      <p>The problem? Analysts have questioned who a potential buyer would be given the secular declines in linear television networks amid escalating cord-cutting trends.</p>
      <p>"Every media company is facing cord-cutting, shifts of television advertising to connected TVs and other platforms," Rich Greenfield, media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners, told Yahoo Finance Live. "The linear TV business is just under a lot of pressure, and investors are already asking me, 'Well, who are they selling it to?' 'Who wants to buy a linear TV business?'"</p>
      <p>Iger, who made the comments in a lengthy interview with CNBC on Thursday morning, a day after the company announced it will be extending his contract through 2026, admitted the current distribution model is "definitely broken."</p>
      <p>He explained Disney's linear TV assets, which include broadcast network ABC and cable channels FX, Freeform, and National Geographic, "may not be core" to its strategy any longer.</p>
      <p>"That's what's really challenging," Greenfield noted. "It's one thing to say you want to get rid of ABC or get rid of FX. But who exactly is the buyer of those businesses? I don't have a great answer for that."</p>
      <p>Other industry watchers said a possible asset sale is likely necessary to protect the business' future — but only with the right buyer.</p>
      <p>"We agree that asset sales are a good idea, but our best advice would be to sell all (or all the content assets) of DIS to AAPL, AMZN, or another company that never needs to make money from creating content," Needham analyst Laura Martin wrote in a note to clients on Friday morning. "If they don't sell, DIS will be competing against those companies in an industry with deteriorating economics (because they never need to make money from content), we believe."</p>
      <p>Disney shares are down about 2% on the year and have fallen nearly 5% compared to this point last year.</p>
      <h3>The 'everything rally' seems to be back</h3>
      <p>Canvassing the week's tape, the top three US large-cap sectors are once again favoring the megacaps. Communication Services (XLC), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), and Tech (XLK) are each up more than 3% — reminiscent of the returns earlier this year from January to May.</p>
      <p>Economic data is surprising to the upside over the last two months, showing falling inflation, an economy that's still growing (though slowly), and a surprisingly optimistic consumer.</p>
      <p>Rates are dropping, as the 10-year (^TNX) has once again firmly rejected the ~4% level and is down the most in four weeks (23 bps). You can add a plunging dollar (DX-Y.NYB) to those tailwinds. The dropping Dixie is buoying commodities, emerging markets — and even crypto, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) attempts to launch higher from the big $30k level.</p>
      <p>It's a recipe for higher asset prices all around. Even Consumer Staples (XLP) is getting some love this week.</p>
      <h3>Bank earnings tell two different stories</h3>
      <p>Some bank stocks were mixed after reporting second quarter earnings before the bell Friday. Around 12:30 on Friday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were up marginally while shares of Citigroup (C) fell more than 3%.</p>
      <p>Profits for JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo surged in the second quarter while falling sharply at Citigroup, demonstrating a divide in how the banking world is faring as it recovers from a period of extreme turmoil.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan and Wells Fargo showed that some giants can continue to make lots of money from consumer loans even as industry deposit costs rise, while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue. What Citigroup revealed is that a number of problems continue to plague even the biggest institutions, especially those that rely heavily on dealmaking and trading.</p>
      <p>Citigroup's profit tumbled 36% in the second quarter, largely because of weaknesses in its Wall Street unit. Other banks reporting next week, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), could run into similar challenges.</p>
      <p>"The long-awaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize, making for a disappointing quarter," said Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser.</p>
      <h3>Stocks higher in afternoon trading</h3>
      <p>Stocks fell from their morning session highs but maintained gains just after noon on Friday as investors digested second quarter earnings from some of the nation's largest banks and a surprisingly upbeat reading of consumer sentiment.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led gains, rising 0.4%, or more than 100 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ticked 0.15% higher, while Nasdaq (^IXIC) rose about 0.3%.</p>
      <h3>Clear skies ahead for Microsoft, according to UBS</h3>
      <p>Microsoft's cloud declines may be a thing of the past, UBS argued in a new note on Monday.</p>
      <p>UBS upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral and boosted its price target to $400 from $345, saying new bookings discussions around cloud are "slowly recovering."</p>
      <p>"We downgraded Microsoft shares to start the year on a view that spending trends on Azure/AWS were deteriorating and that a faster-than-expected Azure deceleration would hold back the stock (it obviously didn’t)," UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote. "Our latest round of checks...suggest the backdrop remains tough but is no longer deteriorating - the worst may be behind us."</p>
      <p>A bottom in slowing cloud demand would be a welcome sign for Microsoft investors. In April, the tech giant reported Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 27% year-over-year for the quarter. That number has declined every quarter since at least Q3 2022, as companies trim their capital expenses amid rising interest rates.</p>
      <p>UBS also commented that AI enthusiasm makes it "increasingly tough to be on the sidelines," ahead of earnings later this month. Shares of Microsoft were up nearly 2% on Friday.</p>
      <h3>AT&T stock hits 20-year low on JPM downgrade</h3>
      <p>AT&T (T) stock fell as much as 5% on Friday following a downgrade from analysts at JPMorgan.</p>
      <p>At session lows, shares of AT&T were trading a 20-year low.</p>
      <p>In their note, JPM analysts cited a view the company is facing "marginally more pressure" in its mobility and wireline segments. JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $17 from $22.</p>
      <p>The firm also flagged potential liabilities from recent reports suggesting telecom giants like AT&T and Verizon laid a huge network of lead-covered cables across the country as a risk for the stock.</p>
      <p>"We have discussed the copper lead sheathing situation with many industry contacts and have been unable to find a reasonable way to calculate any potential liability, but believe that AT&T will have the largest exposure given its massive LEC business (~40% of homes in the US) as well as owning the original AT&T long haul network," the firm wrote. "We see the potential liability as an unquantifiable, long- term overhang for the stock, which adds to the risk premium and drives much of our PT reduction."</p>
      <h3>Consumer sentiment hits highest level since Sept. 2021</h3>
      <p>US consumers haven't felt this good about the economy in almost two years, according to the University of Michigan's latest reading on consumer sentiment.</p>
      <p>The UMich consumer sentiment index for July came in at a reading of 72.6, up from 64.4 last month and 51.5 in July 2022. This marks the highest reading for the index since September 2021.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Joanne Hsu, director of the survey of consumers for the University of Michigan, said, "The sharp rise in sentiment was largely attributable to the continued slowdown in inflation along with stability in labor markets...sentiment is now about halfway between the all-time historic low of 50 from June 2022 and the February 2020 pre-pandemic reading of 101."</p>
      <p>Notably, however, Friday's reading showed a slight uptick in consumer inflation expectations, a number that has been closely watched by Federal Reserve officials. Consumers now expect prices to rise 3.4% over the next year, up from 3.1% last month. Over the next 5-10 years, prices are expected to rise 3.1%, up from 3% in June's reading.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the latest inflation reading showed consumer prices rose 3% on a headline basis in June, the least since March 2021. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy, prices rose 4.8% over the prior year.</p>
      <h3>JPMorgan profits surge in second quarter</h3>
      <p>JPMorgan (JPM) stock popped nearly 3% in early trading on Monday after the company reported second quarter earnings highlighted by 67% growth in profits compared to the year prior.</p>
      <p>The largest US bank reported earnings of $14.5 billion while revenue of $41 billion was up 34%.</p>
      <p>"The US economy continues to be resilient," said JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. "Consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and consumers are spending, albeit a little more slowly."</p>
      <p>JPMorgan’s results demonstrated that it is still able to make lots of money from its loans while leaning on its sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue. Its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it charges to make loans and pays for deposits, rose 44% from a year ago to $21.9 billion.</p>
      <h3>Big banks send Dow higher at open</h3>
      <p>Stocks opened in the green on Friday, extending a week-long rally as results from JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) showed strength in the US financial system.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led gains, rising 0.45%, or about 150 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) both popped about 0.25%.</p>
      <h3>Dow futures surge after JPM, Wells Fargo earnings beat</h3>
      <p>The rising Dow was a standout before the bell Friday, getting a lift from gains for JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, while the other major gauges were little changed.</p>
      <p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.45%, or about 150 points. S&P 500 futures (^GSPC) were broadly flat, up just 0.08%, and contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 0.07%.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan (JPM) shares added 3% in premarket trading after the largest US bank reported Q2 earnings up 67% from a year ago, putting distance between itself and rivals. Wells Fargo's (WFC) stock also put on 3% after its earnings beat.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones gained as Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke about its TV business. A Cathie Wood stock hit a buy zone. Nvidia stock cleared an entry.</p>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher despite a Disney (DIS) TV bombshell from CEO Bob Iger. A Cathie Wood stock was in a buy zone after the famed investor bought shares. Red-hot AI stock Nvidia (NVDA) cleared a buy point.</p>	
    	<p>A number of stocks passed buy points amid the ebullient action. Leaderboard stocks ASML (ASML) and On Holding (ONON) tested entries while Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) is a buy zone.</p>
      <p>Stocks were boosted following more positive inflation news. The Producer Price Index came in below views. This applied to both overall and the core producer prices.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, initial unemployment claims unexpectedly dropped to 237,000 vs. 248,000 the previous week. Economists expected claims to edge higher to 249,000. The jobs market continues to show impressive strength.</p>
      <p>Treasury yields fell again. The 10-year yield tumbled 10 basis points to 3.76% while the two-year yield dropped 12 basis points to 4.62%. Nevertheless, the yield curve remains inverted.</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq Rallies As IBD 50, Small Caps Jump</h3>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq popped again, the tech-heavy index roaring 1.6% higher. IBD Sector Leaders stock Zscaler (ZS) was a top performer here, rising 5.4%.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&P 500 finished the session up 0.9%. Epam Systems (EPAM) was a noteworthy performer in the S&P as it jumped 4.8%.</p>
      <p>Both indexes closed at their highest levels in 2023 so far. Volume was lower on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq, according to early data.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 sectors finished mostly positive. Communication services and technology were the top gainers. Health and energy were the only laggards in the stock market today.</p>
      <p>Small caps partook in the gains, with the Russell 2000 popping 1%. Growth stocks impressed even more, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) closing up 1.6%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Microsoft Stock Pops, Disney TV News</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other major indexes as closed with a meager gain of 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Disney stock ended the day up 0.4% after Iger spoke about the challenges ahead for the troubled media giant. Disney is up less than 2% in 2023, badly lagging the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>He told CNBC "the company is facing a lot of challenges, some of them self-inflicted" and said its TV business "may not be core to Disney."</p>
      <p>Disney's portfolio of TV networks, which includes ABC and ESPN, had long been a key profitability engine for the company. But consumers are increasingly turning to streaming services.</p>
      <p>There was more bad news for Disney Thursday after it emerged the Screen Actors Guild — American Federation of Television and Radio Artists had voted to go on strike. This means film and television productions will grind to a halt from midnight. They will join more than 11,000 Writers Guild of America members already on strike.</p>
      <p>This is the first time since 1960 when two major Hollywood unions have been on strike at the same time.</p>
      <p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT),</strong> which is benefiting from the boom in AI stocks, was the best performer on the Dow as it gained about 1.6%. The stock is trading above its main moving averages, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
      <p><strong>Cisco Systems (CSCO)</strong> also made a strong gain on the Dow Jones today, rising 1.6%.</p>
      <p><strong>Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)</strong> lagged with a 1.9% decline.</p>
      <h3>Cathie Wood Buys Teradyne As It Hits Buy Zone</h3>
      <p>Investors are always keen to follow the moves of top portfolio managers.</p>
      <p>ARK Invest chief Wood added to her holdings of Teradyne (TER) yesterday.</p>
      <p>She bought more than 12,000 shares for her ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and over 3,000 shares for her ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX).</p>
      <p>The move looks inspired at the moment, as TER has just moved into a buy zone above a 112.06 buy point after finding support at the 21-day exponential moving average.</p>
      <p>TER stock is up nearly 33% so far this year. ARKQ's performance is even better, rising almost 55% in that time frame, while ARKX is up almost 26%.</p>
      <p>Cathie Wood also sold more Tesla (TSLA), this time unloading more than 20,000 shares across her various funds.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Stock Clears Entry Amid AI Boom</h3>
      <p>Chip leader Nvidia has been on a remarkable run in 2023, rising almost 220% so far.</p>
      <p>Investors have another opportunity to clamber aboard the stock market freight train as it powers past a four-weeks-tight entry of 439.90.</p>
      <p>These are usually used as an opportunity to buy additional shares to an existing position. Aggressive investors may also use it as a buy point in a new position.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock has been soaring amid a massive hunger for artificial intelligence stocks. NVDA chips are key at the moment for AI applications.</p>
      <p>Analysts see earnings vaulting 112% in the current fiscal year ending in January 2024 to $7.09 a share and blasting 41% higher the next fiscal year.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: Leaderboard Stocks Test Buy Points</h3>
      <p>With the market rally continuing to show strength, now is the time to be looking for stocks staging breakouts.</p>
      <p>ASML is in a buy zone after earlier clearing a flat base buy point of 747.13. This is a first-stage base, a plus, although volume was middling.</p>
      <p>All-around performance is top-notch here, which is reflected in its perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99.</p>
      <p>Shoe stock On Holding raced past a cup-with-handle base with a 33.67 buy point but ended the session just below the entry. The sneaker play, which is backed by tennis legend Roger Federer, is up more than 100% so far this year.</p>
      <p>Both ASML and ONON are part of the prestigious Leaderboard list of top stocks.</p>
      <p>Magellan Midstream Partners is a buy zone. It cleared a flat base entry of 64.42 but the fact the move came in low volume is a negative.</p>
      <p>The petroleum transportation play has been seeing its relative strength line move higher of late. The company has agreed to be acquired by Oneok (OKE).</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) ticked up on Thursday as the pound (GBPUSD=X) hit a 15-month high against the dollar, rising past the $1.30 mark.</p>
    	<p>Meanwhile, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the UK's economy in contraction for May.</p>	
    	<p>Economists from PwC put the pullback down to multiple factors including the extra coronation bank holiday, and the fact there was industrial action. At 0.1%, it was still not as bad a drop as had been predicted, with a consensus expectation of a 0.3% fall.</p>
      <p>The FTSE closed 0.34% higher, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.65% and Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.82%.</p>
      <p>Sterling continued to climb, hitting a 15-month high, as weaker-than-expected US inflation figures increased expectations that interest rates were close to peaking across the pond.</p>
      <p>In the US, stocks kept up their rally on Thursday, after producer price data gave further evidence inflation is cooling and earnings season started to get underway.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.1% to 34,372 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) advanced 0.47% to 4,493 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) climbed 0.96% to 14,050.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the UK house builders signalled potential weakness in the market to come, as mortgage rates continue to cause anxiety.</p>
      <p>An update from Barratt (BDEV.L) warned of deteriorating conditions in the market due to a collapse in sales to first-time buyers. The news drove its stock down more than 5% in early trade, settling around 2.6% lower later on in the session.</p>
      <h3>Gas prices could halve this winter</h3>
	    <p>Europe could see natural gas prices slump to around €15 this winter — about half the current level — on mild weather and weak demand, according to Morgan Stanley.</p>
      <p>Prices could tumble to levels last seen before Russia invaded Ukraine “if weather is persistently warm and renewables perform strongly,” according to analysts including Martijn Rats.</p>
      <p>That’s at least one scenario envisioned by the bank after October, which it acknowledges is a tricky period to forecast, according to Bloomberg. At the other extreme, prices could surge to €100 if Europe freezes for a prolonged period and renewables don’t provide sufficient relief. Using a weighted average, they’re more likely to be around €45, the analysts said.</p>
      <h3>The Special Relationship in one chart</h3>
      <p>The weaker-than-expected US CPI print has triggered large moves across global markets, including the UK. Deustche Bank has come up with a chart that shows it's far from uncommon for UK markets to be moved significantly by price prints from across the Atlantic.</p>
      <p><strong>Delta Airlines (DAL) </strong>was pushed to an earnings record due to a takeoff (heh) in transatlantic travel. It raised full-year guidance for the second time in less than three weeks, to a range of $6 to $7 per share.</p>
      <p>Its transatlantic capacity is now exceeding pre-pandemic levels.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in corporate earnings:</p>

      <h3>The top line from the OBR: The updated long-term projection sees debt surpass 300% of GDP in 50 years’ time.</h3>
      <p>And it would go even higher if rising debt pushes interest rates up further or shocks over the next 50 years prove to be as frequent and costly as those over the past two decades.</p>
      <p>The OBR added, on debt and reducing the deficit:</p>
      <p><strong>Government debt levels have tripled since the start of this century. Despite all Chancellors since 2010 aiming to get debt falling, at 100 per cent of GDP, debt is at its highest level in over 60 years</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The UK Government has seen a larger and more rapid rise in its debt servicing costs than other advanced economies. This is due to our larger rise in interest rates, larger share of inflation-linked debt, and shorter effective maturity</strong></p>
      <p>The latest OBR fiscal risks and sustainability report showed that the UK faces risks to public finances due to the events of the last few years.</p>
      <p>On the costs of health it said:</p>
      <p>The post-pandemic increase in health-related inactivity is weighing on the public finances:</p>
      <p>-- Around £7bn added to the welfare bill</p>
      <p>-- Around £9bn lost in foregone tax revenue</p>
      <p>-- Extra pressures on the NHS of £900-1,800 per person, per year</p>
      <h3>What's more:</h3>
      <p>Since the pandemic, economic inactivity among working-age people has increased by around 350,000 people. This is more than explained by 440,000 more people citing ill-health as their reason for being outside the labour force.</p>
      <p>Here's what the year-to-date oil chart looks like:</p>
      <h3>Oil demand forecast cut by IEA</h3>
      <p>The IEA cut its expectations for oil demand this year due to headwinds for the global economy.</p>
      <p>"World oil demand is coming under pressure from the challenging economic environment, not least because of the dramatic tightening of monetary policy in many advanced and developing countries over the past twelve months," it wrote.</p>
      <p>"Growth in 2023 has been revised down for the first time this year, to 2.2 mb/d from 2.4 mb/d expected previously, with China poised to account for 70% of the total."</p>
      <p>Brent crude (BZ=F) futures prices seemed to shrug this off, ticking up 0.1% following the release.</p>
      <p>Watch company Swatch's (UHR.SW) half-year results showed rebounding demand in China bringing sales back to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
      <p>Operating profit rose 36% to around £610m for H1. Net sales rose 18% to £3.5bn. The results beat analysts expectations.</p>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) rose to its highest levels in over a year against the dollar on Thursday morning, heading past the $1.30 mark following the US inflation read.</p>
      <p>A stronger pound means imports of goods like food and petrol become less expensive.</p>
      <p>The pound is also up against the euro.</p>
      <p>Results to watch today:</p>
      <p>Norwegian oil exploration company Aker BP (AKRBP.OL)</p>
      <p>UK’s largest luxury timepiece retailer Watches of Switzerland (WOSG.L)</p>
      <p>Other things to watch:</p>

      <p>France inflation data</p>
      <p>The ECB's meeting minutes</p>
      <h3>Overnight in the US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Good morning! Welcome to the live blog. We've already had a GDP read here in the UK for May.</p>
      <p>Here's a recap on what happened in markets in the US and Asia overnight:</p>
      <p>US indices finished in the green last night following the CPI read. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.7%, the Dow (^DJI) was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) rose 1.2%.</p>
      <p>Asian indexes were also buoyant, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) finishing 2.5% higher, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) rising 1.3% and the Nikkei in Japan up 1.5%.</p>
      <p>US CPI data was better than expected, reducing the Federal Reserve's need to implement more rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Beijing also said it would look to support Asian tech platforms yesterday, which hints that its years-long crackdown is coming to a close.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- With the S&P 500 up 25% in nine months and sitting at its best level since April 2022, people want to know: is an all-time high next? John Flood, a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., thinks so.</p>
    	<p>“For first time in 2023 we are currently being asked by multiple clients if we think the S&P 500 is now on track to clock an ATH before year end,” Flood wrote in a note to clients Wednesday after a soft reading in the consumer price index lifted the equity benchmark as much as 1.1%. “I am going with a yes on this.”</p>	
    	<p>Getting there would require an extension of a rally that has already shocked most on Wall Street amid better-than-expected economic growth and corporate earnings. The index made a record 4,796.56 in January 2022, about 7% above the last close.</p>
      <p>Flood’s optimism is at odds with the majority of Wall Street strategists who keep hanging on their bearish view that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening will lead to an economic slowdown if not an outright recession. Their average year-end target, as compiled by Bloomberg in mid-June, shows the S&P 500 will fall about 8% by December — the worst second-half outlook since at least 1999.</p>
      <p>Stocks have recovered all their losses since the Fed began raising interest rates 16 months ago, with the S&P 500 now trading roughly 3% above where it was at the start of the hiking cycle.</p>
      <p>Flood is among a small but growing group of equity bulls that set eyes for new highs. Ed Yardeni, an early cheerleader of this bull run who has a year-end target of 4,600, says he will probably raise the forecast to 4,800, “depending on how things are shaping up.”</p>
      <p>The 4,600 projection “looked delusional earlier this year, I have to admit, but it’s worked out awfully well,” the president of Yardeni Research said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.</p>
      <p>Second-quarter reporting season, due to kick off unofficially by banks Friday, is likely to bolster equities, as the forecast 9% profit drop sets what Flood calls “another low bar” for corporate America to clear. While the period likely marks the trough of this earnings slowdown, he notes that excluding the drag from energy, growth already bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year, coinciding with the market’s nadir.</p>	
    	<p>“The bar for this period is exceptionally low (again),” Flood wrote. It’s “a positive signal for stocks.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>A Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place July 24. Apple, Microsoft and the other "magnificent seven" stocks hold a 55% weight now.</p>
    	<p>The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.</p>	
    	<p>The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights." The Nasdaq has only conducted a special rebalance twice in its history: in December 1998 and May 2011.</p>
      <p>The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.</p>
      <h3>How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?</h3>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.</p>
      <p>The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. This combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable relative weighting shifts within these seven giants.</p>
      <p>The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.</p>
      <p>Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.</p>
      <p>Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.</p>
      <h3>How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?</h3>
      <p>Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.</p>
      <p>The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.</p>
      <h3>Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023</h3>
      <p>The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.</p>
      <p>This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.</p>
      <p>There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.</p>
      <h3>Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?</h3>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.</p>
      <p>However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&P 500, which is why S&P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.</p>
      <p>Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.</p>
      <p>The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.</p>
      <p>Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>European stocks and the FTSE 100 opened in the green on Tuesday as the latest UK wage growth figures delivered a blow to the Bank of England’s bid to bring down inflation.</p>
    	<p>It comes after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, hit an annual rate of 7.3% during the three months to May — the highest level on record and higher than analysts had expected.</p>	
	    <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) opened up 0.05% at 7,277.55 points. The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris rose 0.72% to 7,194.57 points, while in Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) climbed 0.51% to 15,748.69 points.</p>	
	    <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>In the US, Wall Street closed higher on Monday as traders anticipate key US inflation data out this week and second-quarter (Q2) earnings reports from JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and BlackRock (BLK).</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.62% to 33,944.40 points, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.24% to 4,409.53 points, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) climbed 0.18% to 13,685.48.</p>
      <p>In Asia, the markets staged a recovery overnight as the markets continued to digest the news that China's factory-gate prices in June experienced the most significant decrease in seven-and-a-half years, while consumer inflation reached its lowest point since 2021.</p>
      <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) closed up 0.04% to 32,203.57 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.18% to 18,698.19. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also rose, by 0.48% to 3,219.28 points.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The release of the UK wage growth data this morning sent the pound up to its strongest position against the US dollar since April 2022, as investors doubled down on bets in favour of higher Bank of England interest rates.</p>
      <p>The pound to dollar exchange rate (GBPUSD=X) in early trade on Tuesday rose 0.28% to 1.28, meaning £1 will get you $1.28. Meanwhile the pound to euro exchange rate (GBPEUR=X) went up 0.10% to 1.16.</p>
      <p>Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, said: "Financial markets are now pricing in a peak in UK rates of around 6.35% in the first quarter of 2024, which would surely make the BoE the most hawkish major central bank in the world between now and then.</p>
      <p>“We think that markets are slightly ahead of themselves, although we do expect another 50 basis point hike from the MPC in August, with a real risk that the base rate tops out above 6%.”</p>
      <h3>Oil prices</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, oil prices extended gains on Tuesday as OPEC+ output cuts offset demand concerns among investors.</p>
      <p>US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), gained 0.47% to trade at $73.33 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) rose 0.36% to $77.97 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Economic data</h3>
      <p>Investors will also be watching key data out this week, including US CPI data for June on Wednesday with prices set to rise 3.6%year-on-year and 0.2% month-on-month, from 4% and 0.1% respectively, from 5.3% and 0.4%.</p>
      <p>The Bank of Canada will also have its rate decision on Wednesday, which is expected to rise 22bps.</p>
      <p>Moreover, all eyes will be on Brent and WTI crude prices when US EIA crude oil inventories are released.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, China's trade balance figures for June will be closely watched with exports expected to fall.</p>
      <p>UK GDP figures for May will also come out on Thursday with growth expected to be flat.</p>
      <p>Also on Thursday, US PPI (June) data will be released showing initial jobless claims, which is also expected to fall.</p>

    	<p>Members of the Federal Reserve indicated in public statements that inflation continued to be a problem that could require further interest rate hikes, and the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair, Michael Barr, said that banks could need even tighter regulations to protect financial stability. While the Dow reacted more positively to the news, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up about 0.1% in the trading session as investors wait for Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation data. Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) gained 2.5% to lead the Dow Jones higher, while pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) increased 2%.</p>

        <li>Apple moved lower after its supplier Foxconn pulled out of a deal in India.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In advance of key inflation data coming later this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rebounded from last week’s 2% drop, with investors sending the index higher by 0.5%, or 175 points.</p>	
    	<p>Members of the Federal Reserve indicated in public statements that inflation continued to be a problem that could require further interest rate hikes, and the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair, Michael Barr, said that banks could need even tighter regulations to protect financial stability.

    	<p>Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) gained 2.5% to lead the Dow Jones higher, while pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) increased 2%. Another pharmaceutical manufacturer, Merck & Co. (MRK), rose by 1.3%, as the health sector moved higher by 0.7%.</p>
      <p>The industrials sector was the best performing, moving higher by 1.3%, with Honeywell (HON) shares were up about 1.9% after it said it would buy Scadafence, an Israel-based cybersecurity provider. Caterpillar (CAT) gained 1%.</p>
      <p>While technology stocks have been helping lead recent market gains, today they stood on the opposite end of the trend.</p>
      <p>Microsoft (MSFT) dropped 2.4% as investors await the outcome of a U.S. District Court hearing over whether to grant the Federal Trade Commission a temporary injunction to block its acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard. The judge’s ruling on the injunction is expected this week, with the companies warning that the merger is likely dead if the injunction is granted.</p>
      <p>Shares of Apple (AAPL) dropped 1.6% after one of its key suppliers, Foxconn, said it would pull out of a deal that would have built a semiconductor chip manufacturing facility in India. Apple has been urging its affiliates to diversify its supply chain in order to reduce its reliance on mainland China amid rising political tensions.</p>
      <p>Verizon (VZ) fell 1.4% after a report showed that several major telecom companies have left behind as many as 2,000 old telephone cables that are covered in lead, potentially creating an expensive environmental cleanup for the company. AT&T (T) shares also fell on the report, dropping 2.2%.</p>

    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped Friday after a weaker-than-expected monthly jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department. Meanwhile, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) jumped as the company faces a $1.1 billion fine on its fintech affiliate, Ant Group.</p>
    	<p>Friday's employment report for June showed that nonfarm payrolls rose 209,000, below estimates for growth of 213,000 and down from May's 339,000 growth. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.6%, in line with estimates.</p>

      <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 inched lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved up 0.1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded up 0.4%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) gained 0.1% early Friday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.08% after the jobs report as it continues to break out above recent highs. The yield settled Thursday at 4.04%, its highest level since early March.</p>
      <p>Oil prices continued higher Friday morning, after slight gains on Thursday. West Texas Intermediate futures traded up around 0.3%, to near $72 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1%. In the Dow 30, American Express (AXP) skidded nearly 2.7%, just as it was getting close to a 177.04 buy point in a cup with handle.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both lost 0.8%, well off the session lows. The small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 1.6%.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "Despite Thursday's sharp losses, the stock market uptrend remains intact. So, IBD's recommended market exposure still sits at 80%-100%. Still, investors should be prepared for the market to pull back some more."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column as the stock market holds near this year's highs.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: JPMorgan, Salesforce, Visa</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones banking leader JPMorgan ended trading Thursday just below a 143.37 flat-base buy point following the session's 1% decline. The 5% buy zone goes up to 150.54. JPM stock rose 0.6% Friday morning, following an upgrade to outperform from peer perform. Wolfe has its 12-month price target set at 170, about 19% above where shares closed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Salesforce managed to steady itself after its post-earnings slump. It is now testing support at the 50-day line and a decisive rebound would create a new buying opportunity. The megacap tech previously moved past a pair of alternative entries at 194.01 and at 200.10, according to IBD Leaderboard analysis.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry. CRM stock inched lower Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Payments leader Visa closed further above a flat base's 235.57 buy point Thursday, with a gain of 0.6%. The buy range tops out at 247.35. V stock fell 0.8% early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Alphabet, Chipotle, Dynatrace, MongoDB, Nvidia</h3>
      <p>Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day, Alphabet, is trying to find support around its 50-day line. This week, investors could have used the June 30 high of 121.08 as a buy point. But shares are below that buy trigger after Thursday's loss of nearly 1.4%. Plus, Alphabet shares could have a proper base in another week. GOOGL stock moved down 0.1% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Chipotle is trying to break out past flat base's 2,139.88 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. An early entry at 2,092.51 was also available due to a trendline. Chipotle was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day. CMG stock fell 0.3% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Software maker Dynatrace has formed a three-weeks-tight chart pattern, representing a brief consolidation in which institutional investors pause their buying. Shares are about 3% away from their latest entry at 52.99. DT stock was down 0.4% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>MongoDB traded tightly after its recent earnings-fueled jump, which offered a new entry. Shares are just above the three-weeks-tight formation that showed a buy point at 398.89 after two straight days of losses. Meanwhile, aggressive investors could have used a trendline entry around 386. MDB stock moved up 0.3% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Following its May 25 earnings-fueled gap-up, Nvidia shares have been trending consistently higher. Amid a pullback since June 20, the stock is offering another opportunity to buy shares. It formed a trendline entry at 418 after the stock found support at its 21-day exponential moving average. Nvidia is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Shares gained 0.5% Friday.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla snapped a six-day win streak Thursday, with a 2.1% skid. Still, Tesla shares remain sharply out of buy range beyond a double-bottom's 207.79 buy point.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock looked to rebound from Thursday's losses, climbing 0.9% Friday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock continued to hold just off last week's record high at 194.48, rising 0.25% Thursday. Shares continue to hold sharply above a 157.38 buy point. Early Friday, shares fell 0.2% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares rose another 0.9% Thursday, holding about 4% away from their June 16 all-time high at 351.47. Shares are on pace to end with a modest weekly gain.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, the stock reached the 20% to 25% profit zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors could have taken at least some profits there. And on Friday morning, Microsoft shares were down 0.4%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The jobs report looms with Treasury yields soaring. Meta is among stocks holding up as Threads had record first-day downloads.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures tilted lower early Friday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The June jobs report looms large.</p>
      <p>The stock market rally retreated Thursday as strong economic data sent Treasury yields soaring, though indexes pared morning losses somewhat. The ADP Employment Report estimated private payrolls skyrocketed 497,000 in June, more than double forecasts. The ISM services sector index rose more than expected. Initial jobless claims rose modestly, but the four-week average fell while continuing claims slipped. Announced layoff plans declined significantly last month.</p>
      <p>Meta Platforms (META) held up well as its Threads app grabbed 30 million sign-ups in less than a day for the Twitter rival, perhaps 48 million in 24 hours. It's the fastest number of downloads ever. Twitter threatened legal action vs. its new rival. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who owns Twitter, said "cheating" is not OK.</p>	
    	<p>Microsoft (MSFT) rallied amid a price target hike.</p>	
    	<p>Looking for stocks holding up; Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are holding in buy zones, along with DexCom (DXCM). Nvidia (NVDA) continues to trade tightly. HubSpot (HUBS) skidded Thursday morning, but rallied off key support.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the FDA approved Biogen's Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi late Thursday. Biogen (BIIB) and partner Eisai already have accelerated approval, but full FDA approval boosts their chances of getting Medicare reimbursement for Leqembi.</p>
      <p>Biogen stock was roughly flat early Friday after being halted overnight. Shares edged down 0.3% Thursday. Eli Lilly (LLY), which has a similar Alzheimer's treatment in trial, edged higher overnight. LLY stock dipped 0.5% Thursday.</p>
      <p>META stock, Nvidia and HubSpot are on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders. HUBS stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article discussed Thursday's market action and analyzed MSFT stock, Adobe (ADBE) and HubSpot.</p>
      <h3>Jobs Report: What To Expect</h3>
      <p>The Labor Department will release the June jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>Economists expect to see an increase of 213,000 jobs, down from May's 339,000. The unemployment rate should slip down to 3.6%. Average hourly wage growth is seen cooling to 4.2% from May's 4.3%.</p>
      <p>The ADP doesn't have a great track record of predicting Labor's nonfarm payrolls. Still, the odds of a July 26 Fed rate hike are now a near lock at 93%. The odds of yet another quarter-point hike in November rose to roughly 46% on Thursday, up significantly from a couple weeks ago.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures lost 0.1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.2%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 1 basis points to 4.06%, just below 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>Copper futures rose slightly.</p>
      <p>The jobs report is sure to swing Treasury yields and Dow futures before the open.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally sold off on soaring yields following the ADP report, though indexes did close off lows. The 10-year Treasury yield advanced 10 basis points to 4.04%, a four-month high. The 2-year yield climbed 5 basis points to 5% after spiking to a 16-year high of 5.12% intraday.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 1.1% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite gave up 0.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slumped 1.6% after Wednesday's 1% slide.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq and S&P 500 found support around their 10-day moving averages. But the Dow Jones tumbled below its 10-day and 21-day lines, not far from its 50-day average.</p>
      <p>Market breadth was terrible Thursday, with losers trouncing winners by 6-to-1 on the NYSE and by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq. That followed negative breadth on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) shed 0.8% and the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) gave up 1.3%. But both rebounded from their 21-day lines.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices rose 1 cent to $71.80 a barrel</p>
      <p>Leading stocks retreated further on Thursday. Many found support at key levels, but not all.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) declined 2%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gave up just over 1%. MSFT stock is a major IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell 1.2% after Wednesday's 1.9% loss. NVDA stock is the No. 1 SMH holding.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) tumbled 3.8% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 3.6%.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) shed 1.75%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 2.2%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 2%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) receded 2.25% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) faltered 0.8%.</p>
      <p>The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) lost 0.75%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) slid 0.9%, with Visa stock and MA big parts of the XLF ETF. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 0.6%.</p>
      <h3>Meta Stock</h3>
      <p>META stock dipped 0.8% to 291.99, holding strong after climbing 2.9% to a 17-month high Wednesday in anticipation of the Threads launch.</p>
      <p>The text-based Threads, part of Instagram, launched Wednesday night and grabbed more than 30 million sign-ups within the first 16 hours. In the first 24 hours, sign-ups topped 48 million, according to one media report, citing internal Meta data. Even the lower figure is by  far the best first-day download on record. For comparison, ChatGPT got 1 million downloads in its first five days.</p>
      <p>With many celebrities, high-profile journalists and other power Twitter users quickly posting, Threads appears to be the biggest threat yet to Twitter. That site has struggled since Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion last fall. Musk has alienated many users and especially advertisers with various restrictions.</p>
      <p>Instagram's chief acknowledged that Threads lacks a number of basic features, with staff working hard to introduce them.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for Twitter threatened legal action vs Meta. In a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Spiro accused Meta of poaching former Twitter staff and engaging in "unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property."</p>
      <p>Musk, in a reply to a tweet about that Twitter legal threat, wrote "Competition is fine, cheating is not."</p>
      <p>Meta, in a response to the Twitter legal threat, said "No one on the the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee."</p>
      <h3>Microsoft Stock</h3>
      <p>Microsoft stock edged up 0.9% to 341.27, bouncing from near its 21-day line. Morgan Stanley raised its MSFT stock price target to 415 from 335. Shares have consolidated for the past few weeks since hitting a record high 351.47 on June 16. Investors could view the recent pause as a high handle to a consolidation going back to late 2021. But investors should probably wait for a longer pause before seeking out a Microsoft stock entry.</p>
      <h3>Stocks To Watch</h3>
      <p>Visa stock slipped 0.2% to 238.88, continuing to hold above a 235.57 flat-base buy point. Mastercard stock dipped 0.3% to 393.14, just above a 392.20 flat-base buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. The payment giants offered early entries last week, but both are still within range of the 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock gave up 0.5% to 421.03, above its 10-day line. Shares aren't far from their 21-day line, but they haven't touched that short-term level in two months. NVDA stock has a three-weeks-tight pattern that could turn into a four weeks tight after Friday.</p>
      <p>A test of the 21-day line, or possibly the 400 level, could be a nice shakeout and let the fast-rising 50-day line close the gap. The official buy point is 439.90, but Wednesday's high of 431.77 would offer an early entry.</p>
      <p>DexCom stock shaved 0.3% to 127.70, closing above its 126.44 flat-base buy point after finding support at its 21-day line for a third straight session. DXCM stock has struggled to clear a range from the start of November. But shares have trended higher, in choppy form, since late January.</p>
      <p>HubSpot eked out a 0.1% gain to 521.34, closing above the 21-day line. Shares skidded to an intraday low 497.03 but rebounded from the 10-week line. Investors who bought HUBS stock as it tried to clear a four-weeks-tight at the end of June may have gotten shaken out. But it could set up again.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The new or renewed market pullback could be constructive, letting new buying opportunities emerge from pullbacks to key levels and possibly forging bases.</p>
      <p>But investors don't know that current slide will be mild once again, or that their positions will hold up relatively well.</p>
      <p>It's a time to consider trimming some profits and being quick to cut losses, especially on newer buys.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, investors should look for those constructive pullbacks and stocks holding key levels and showing relative strength, such as HUBS stock, Visa and perhaps Nvidia. Watchlists once again may need serious revision in the coming days. But that work can deliver big gains when the market rally revs higher again.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>By Shreyashi Sanyal</p>
	    <p>(Reuters) -European shares eked out gains on Friday as data pointing to slowing U.S. job growth eased concerns about interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve but did little to change the main STOXX 600 index's worst weekly showing in almost four months.</p>	
    	<p>The STOXX 600 rose 0.1% by 1615 GMT, turning positive midway through the session after data showed the U.S. economy added the fewest jobs in 2-1/2 years in June.</p>	
    	<p>However, persistently strong U.S. wage growth pointed to still tight labour market conditions that cemented bets the Fed will resume raising interest rates, later this month.</p>
      <p>Traders stuck to bets the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate this month to a 5.25%-5.5% range, but were sceptical of further hikes beyond that.</p>
      <p>"This doesn't change our view that the Fed is poised to continue its hiking cycle this month," said Candice Tse, global head of strategic advisory solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p>
      <p>"The US economy is still growing below potential, inflation continues to decline, but still remains above the Fed's 2% target, keeping the Fed on track for another 25 bps hike."</p>
      <p>European equities took a hit this week as hawkish messages from central banks pushed up yields and drove investors to believe rates will remain high for longer, and as bleak economic readings from the euro zone and China fed concerns of a global slowdown.</p>
      <p>The STOXX 600 fell 3.1% for the week, its worst performance since mid-March.</p>
      <p>For the day, the chemicals sector led gains with a 1.6% rise.</p>
      <p>Sectors, including construction & materials, healthcare and travel & leisure, led falls with declines of over 4% each for the week, while defensive real estate remained the sole gainer with a 0.4% rise.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, German industrial production fell 0.2% in May compared with the previous month. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted that output would stagnate in May.</p>
      <p>Coca Cola HBC AG jumped 5.1%, after it raised its 2023 profit expectation.</p>
      <p>Clariant rose 4.9% after paring losses as the company's preliminary second-quarter results showed weaker sales and outlook for current financial year.</p>
      <p>Top loser on the STOXX 600, OSB Group plunged 28.8%, to hit its lowest since November 2020 after the British lender flagged an up to 180 million pound ($229.4 million) hit as customers refinance their mortgages earlier than forecast.</p>
      <p>Comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will be monitored later in the day.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures fell modestly early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally fell slightly Wednesday, amid rising Treasury yields and a stronger dollar. Meta launched its Twitter rival Wednesday evening, with a rush of signups to start.</p>
    	<p>The major indexes just edged lower. It was another quiet session on the major indexes, with Fed minutes having little impact. META stock, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) offset generally weak breadth.</p>	
    	<p><strong>Meta Platforms (META)</strong> launched Instagram's Twitter rival Wednesday evening, quickly getting more than 10 million sign-ups, according to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The Instagram Threads app debuts amid ongoing issues for Twitter, now owned by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Meta shares rose in extended trading.</p>	
    	<p>GOOGL stock and Salesforce flashed buy signals Wednesday. Meanwhile, MercadoLibre (MELI) is on the cusp of an early entry.</p>
      <p>META stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Google stock is on SwingTrader. Google was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures were 0.65% below fair value. S&P 500 futures fell 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.55%, even with META stock giving modest lift.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.97%.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled 3%, amid real estate developer woes and bank stock downgrades.</p>
      <p>At 8:15 a.m. ET, investors will get the ADP Employment report for June. The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET and the May JOLTS survey, including job openings, at 10 a.m. The June ISM services index also is due at 10 a.m. Friday morning, the Labor Dept. will reveal its June jobs report.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>What Is Meta's Instagram Threads?</h3>
      <p>Meta's new text-based Threads is touted as a place where you can "follow and connect directly with your favorite creators and others who love the same things," according to an App Store description. The Threads app shares many features with Twitter. It lets users "like" a post, reply or repost it. Search capabilities are limited.</p>
      <p>Meta Platforms launched its text-based Threads app at 7 p.m. PT Wednesday, moved up 12 hours from a planned 7 a.m. PT Thursday debut.</p>
      <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg launched Instagram Stories in 2016 to take on Snapchat, owned by Snap (SNAP). Instagram Reels, unveiled in 2020, targets after TikTok.</p>
      <p>Other would-be Twitter rivals, such as Mastodon and Bluesky, have gained users, but have not yet become major threats.  After seven hours, Threads had over 10 million sign-ups, Zuckerberg said Thursday.</p>
      <p>It joins an ecosystem with more than three billion daily users of at least one of Meta's apps — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>Since Musk took over Twitter for $44 billion last year, the social site has alienated advertisers and many users over a variety of issues. In the past week, Twitter has imposed limits over how many tweets that users can read. This "rate limit," which allegedly is to crack down on unauthorized data scraping and bots, affects non-verified users more.</p>
      <h3>Meta Stock</h3>
      <p>META stock popped 2.9% on Wednesday to 294.37, hitting a 17-month high. It's well extended from any possible buy point. Meta Platforms rose more than 1% early Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally Wednesday</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally saw slim declines on the major indexes, with small caps losing a little more. Fed minutes from the June 13-14 meeting, offered few surprises. While pausing rate hikes at that meeting, Fed officials favored more tightening. That's something Fed chief Jerome Powell and other policymakers have stressed since then.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% in Wednesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite lost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 slumped 1.3%, ending a six-session win streak.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices rose 2.9% to $71.79 a barrel. Saudi Arabia signaled it'll do what it takes to prop up prices. That comes after it announced Monday that it would extend a voluntary production cut by another month, through August.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 9 basis points to 3.94%, a four-month high.</p>
      <p>Amid rising U.S. Treasury yields and weak economic data in Europe and Asia, the U.S. dollar rose modestly, right around key levels.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 0.8%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) closed fractionally higher with CRM stock a major component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slumped 1.9%.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slipped 0.35% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) declined 0.65%. TSLA stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) slumped 1.8%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) climbed 0.3%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) declined nearly 1%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) slipped 0.55% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) closed just below break-even.</p>
      <p>The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) fell 0.5%.</p>
      <h3>Google Stock</h3>
      <p>Google stock rose 1.5% to 121.75, rebounding from the 10-week moving average and breaking a downtrend in a short consolidation. Shares also cleared the 21-day line. Investors could use the 21-day line, or the June 30 high of 121.08, as a specific entry. GOOGL stock is on track to have a new base after this week.</p>
      <h3>Salesforce Stock</h3>
      <p>CRM stock climbed 1% to 213.82. Much like Google, Salesforce rose off its 10-week line and broke a short downtrend. The stock has a 225 buy point from a flat base, amid several weeks of tight weekly closes, according to MarketSmith analysis.</p>
      <h3>MercadoLibre Stock</h3>
      <p>MELI stock jumped 4.5% to 1,247.36. Volume was above average and picked up as MercadoLibre stock revved higher. Shares of the Latin American e-commerce and payments giant cleared its 21-day moving average decisively for the first time in a month and broke a short downtrend. But MELI stock stopped just short of the 50-day line. A clear move over the 50-day would offer an early entry. MercadoLibre stock is working on a 1,365.64 buy point.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that MELI stock suffered a number of declines in above average volume over the past several weeks.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The major indexes fell slightly Wednesday after slim gains Monday. Meta Platforms, Salesforce, Google stock and some other megacaps muted broader losses elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Decliners outpaced advancers considerably Wednesday. Many losers showed little damage, though Generac (GNRC) and Aehr Test Systems (AEHR) tumbled 8% and 11%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) declined 0.4%, pulling back from its best levels in more than four months.</p>
      <p>Steelmakers, base metal miners and casinos had a tough day. Some software leaders lost ground, but many came off intraday lows. Medical products firms had another rough session.</p>
      <p>Travel plays generally did well, or at least held up. So did industrials.</p>
      <p>After the market rally rebounded last week, stocks are hesitating at pre-pullbacks. A longer pause or slight decline over several days or weeks could be constructive for the stock market rally. The Nasdaq composite closed 7% above its 50-day moving average, with the Nasdaq 100 7.9% above that key level. Those aren't extreme levels, but they aren't far from being so.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The market rally is going to do what it's going to do. But investors may want to be cautious about adding much exposure in the short term, given the highs odds of sideways action or a renewed pullback.</p>
      <p>In any case, there weren't too many stocks flashing buy signals on Wednesday, aside from Google and CRM stock.</p>
      <p>Plenty of stocks are hovering around buy areas in a variety of sectors, even if many retreated Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Work on those watchlists.</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - Nasdaq refiled an application with the U.S. securities regulator to list an exchange-traded fund by BlackRock Inc that will reflect the price of bitcoin to add additional details, according to a filing made public on Monday.</p>
	    <p>The refreshed filing, submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, said that Coinbase Global Inc will provide market surveillance in support of the proposed ETF from the world's largest asset manager.</p>	
	    <p>The move comes after the regulator reportedly had concerns over the initial filings by Nasdaq as being unclear and incomplete. It had flagged similar concerns to Cboe related to a filing from Fidelity.</p>	
	    <p>The digital asset space is looking to regain popularity after a bruising 2022 that saw several crypto ventures collapse, including the spectacular implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.</p>
      <p>The SEC last month sued Coinbase for failing to register as an exchange. According to Cboe's Fidelity bitcoin ETF filing, the company's platform represented roughly half of U.S. dollar-bitcoin trading in May.</p>
      <p>Coinbase said in a letter filed last month in Manhattan federal court that it will ask a judge to toss the SEC lawsuit, arguing the regulator lacks authority to pursue civil claims because the crypto assets trading on its platform are not "investment contracts", and thus not securities.</p>
      <p>The SEC has rejected dozens of spot bitcoin ETF applications in recent years, including one from Fidelity in January 2022.</p>
      <p>In all the cases, it said the filings did not meet the standards designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices and protect investors and the public interest.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped Monday, with the stock market set to close early for the July 4 holiday. Tesla stock raced higher after the electric-vehicle giant led by Elon Musk reported an 83% surge in deliveries during the second quarter.</p>
    	<p>On the economic front this week, the Labor Department's jobs report on Friday takes the spotlight. Economists are forecasting a gain of around 200,000 jobs and a dip in the jobless rate to 3.6%.</p>	
    	<p>On Monday, the S&P Global Purchasing Manager's Manufacturing Index, or PMI, came in at 46.3, in line with estimates and unchanged from the mid-month estimate.</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index for June unexpectedly fell to 46.0. It was expected to rise to 47.3 vs. May's 46.9 reading, per Econoday estimates.</p>
      <p>The stock market will close early on Monday at 1 p.m. ET. And financial markets will be closed Tuesday for the July 4 holiday. Further, there are few earnings results this week, but Levi Strauss (LEVI) reports late Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) surged more than 8% Monday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were slightly lower after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Other leaders in the stock market rally include Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META). Alphabet shares dipped 0.5%, while Meta stock lost 0.4% in morning trade.</p>
      <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Dynatrace (DT), MongoDB (MDB) and Lam Research (LRCX) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Visa (V) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market advance.</p>
      <p>Tesla is an IBD Leaderboard stock, Lam Research remains an IBD SwingTrader stock, while MongoDB was featured in last week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. Dynatrace was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Monday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved up 0.15% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded up 0.1%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) edged lower early Monday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower to 3.81%. The 10-year yield has been testing the highs of its recent trading range heading into the third quarter. The yield settled lower Friday at 3.81%, just off its recent highs.</p>
      <p>Oil prices looked to extend a win streak to four sessions Monday morning, climbing off recent lows. West Texas Intermediate futures traded up nearly 1%, to just above $71 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher, rallying 1.45% and closing just shy of its 2023 highs. The S&P 500 climbed 1.2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%.</p>
      <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "With indexes looking bullish and the market in a confirmed uptrend, IBD is raising recommended exposure levels to 80% to 100%. However, investors should take care when adding exposure, taking stock of current market levels and increasing at a measured pace. It is also key to remain nimble in case there is a pullback."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column as the stock market approaches this year's highs.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: JPMorgan, Salesforce, Visa</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones banking leader JPMorgan moved further above a 143.37 flat-base buy point during Friday's gains. The 5% buy zone goes up to 150.54. JPM stock rose 0.5% Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Salesforce managed to steady itself after slumping following earnings. It is now testing support at the 50-day line. The megacap tech previously moved past a pair of alternative entries at 194.01 and at 200.10, according to IBD Leaderboard analysis.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry. CRM stock fell 0.3% Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Payments leader Visa topped a flat base's 235.57 buy point Friday, with a 1.35% rally. The buy range tops out at 247.35. V stock dipped 0.25% early Monday.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Chipotle, Dynatrace, MongoDB, Lam Research</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Chipotle is breaking out past a flat base's 2,139.88 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. An early entry at 2,092.51 was also available due to a trendline. Chipotle was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day. CMG stock rose a fraction Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Software maker Dynatrace has formed a three-weeks-tight chart pattern, representing a brief consolidation in which institutional investors pause their buying. Shares are about 3% away from their latest entry at 52.99. DT stock was down 0.2% Monday morning.</p>
      <p>IBD SwingTrader stock Lam Research moved above a 615.80 early buy point and a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 630.72 entry during last week's gains. LRCX stock traded 0.2% higher early Monday.</p>
      <p>MongoDB traded tightly after its recent earnings-fueled jump, which offered a new entry. Shares are above the three-weeks-tight formation that showed a buy point at 398.89, while aggressive investors could have used a trendline entry around 386. MDB stock moved down 1% Monday morning.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla extended a win streak to four sessions Friday, rising 1.7%. Amid the recent rebound, Tesla shares remain sharply out of buy range beyond a double-bottom's 207.79 buy point.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock looked to add to Friday's gains, surging 8.3% Monday.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Tesla said it delivered more than 466,000 vehicles to customers worldwide in the April-to-June period, a record quarter for sales. Price cuts and discounts propelled demand well above Wall Street forecasts.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock hit another record high Friday, trading as high as 194.48. Shares continue to hold sharply above a 157.38 buy point. Early Monday, shares lost 0.1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares added 1.6% Friday, ending last week on a high note. On June 16, MSFT stock hit an all-time high at 351.47.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, the stock reached the 20% to 25% profit zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors could have taken at least some profits there. And on Monday morning, Microsoft shares were down 0.3%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The S&P 500 index hit a 14-month high as the stock market rally roared back this past week. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite are back near 2023 highs, as Apple (AAPL) closed Friday with a $3 trillion market cap for the first time.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Tesla (TSLA) will be in focus, reporting second-quarter deliveries this weekend, along with EV and battery giant BYD (BYDDF). China EV startups Li Auto (LI) Nio (NIO) and XPeng (XPEV) reported June deliveries on Saturday.</p>	
    	<p>Nvidia (NVDA), HubSpot (HUBS), Marriott International (MAR), General Electric (GE) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are all flashing buy signals.</p>	
    	<p>The only concern is that the Nasdaq is already extended again, raising the risk of another market pullback in the near future.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock, Nvidia and HubsSpot are on IBD Leaderboard. HubSpot is on the IBD 50. HubSpot and Tesla stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20.</p>
      <p>In other news, Elon Musk imposed Twitter "rate limit" curbs, restricting how many tweets that users can read in a day.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article discussed the big market moves and analyzed Nvidia, HubSpot and JPM stock.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally extended a brief pullback on Monday, but then rebounded strongly.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index climbed 2.35%. The Nasdaq composite advanced 2.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 leapt 3.7%</p>
      <p>In the first half of 2023, the S&P 500 has jumped 15.9%, its best six-month start since 2019. The Nasdaq surged 31.7%, its best since 1983.</p>
      <p>The Dow is up a modest 3.8% and the Russell 2000 7.4%.</p>
      <p>AAPL stock rose 3.9% last week and 49% so far this year, giving it a $3.05 trillion market cap. It's the first time that Apple or any company has closed with a $3 trillion valuation.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 8 basis points to 3.82%, hitting a three-month high Friday morning.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures rose 2.1% to $70.64 a barrel last week, though it tumbled 6.65% for the quarter. Copper futures slumped 1.6% for the week, but snapped a six-day losing streak on Friday.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) bolted 5.3% last week to a seven-month high while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) leapt 5.25%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) bounced 2.7%, with HUBS stock an IGV holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) rallied 3.2%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) ran up 4.75% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 4%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns a small amount of BYD stock.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) climbed 4.4% last week, regaining its 200-day line for the first time in two months. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) popped 4.6% to a fresh high. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) soared 6% to a 52-week best. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 4.5% for its fifth straight weekly gain. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) bounced 4.9% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) edged up 0.55%. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) revved up 3.9% to just below record highs. GE stock is a key XLI component.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 3%, closing above its 200-day line for the first time since early March. JPM stock is a major holding. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) gained 3.2% after tumbling 8.1% in the prior week.</p>
      <h3>Stocks In Buy Zones</h3>
      <p>Nvidia stock edged up 0.2% to 423.02 last week, but rebounded 3.6% on Friday, moving from near the 21-day line and breaking a short downtrend. That offered a place to start a position or perhaps add a few shares to an existing position. During the week, Nvidia shrugged off reports that the Biden administration will expand its chip export curbs to China, adding more Nvidia products.</p>
      <p>HUBS stock popped 3.9% to 532.09 last week, rebounding from the 21-day line and clearing the bulk of a four-weeks-tight pattern. Intraday Friday, HubSpot briefly topped the 535.12 buy point.</p>
      <p>MAR stock leapt 7.1% to 18.69, staging a big upside week, retaking the 50-day line and clearing buy points just above 183 to hit a 52-week high. Marriott's volume was below average throughout the week.</p>
      <p>GE stock jumped 5.85% to 109.85, rebounding from the 10-week line and clearing a three-weeks-tight buy point of 108.90, according to a weekly MarketSmith chart.</p>
      <p>JPM stock rallied 4.75% to 145.44 last week, with all of the gains coming on Thursday-Friday. That cleared a 143.37 flat-base buy point and set a 16-month high. JPMorgan and other big banks passed Fed stress tests late Wednesday, as expected. Banking giants, and especially JPMorgan, may have a long-term competitive edge over regional banks following the recent crisis.</p>
      <h3>China EV Sales</h3>
      <p>Li Auto reported June sales of 32,575, topping 30,000 for the first time. That's up 150% from a year earlier and 15.2% vs. May. Second-quarter sales were 86,533, up 201.65% vs. Q2 2022, when Covid shutdowns crippled China production and consumption. That easily exceeded a prior target of 76,000-81,000</p>
      <p>Li Auto CEO Li Xiang said Friday that June sales topped 32,000.</p>
      <p>For Q3, the hybrid SUV maker aims for monthly deliveries for the L8 and L9 of more than 10,000, and hoping to reach 15,000 monthly sales of the L7. For Q4, Li is looking for monthly deliveries of 40,000. It'll also roll out its first all-electric model in Q4.</p>
      <p>Nio delivered 10,707 vehicles in June, up 74% from May's 6,155, off 17.4% vs. a year earlier. Sales are picking up with deliveries of the revamped ES6 SUV, as well as the ET5 Touring and overhauled ES8 began to be delivered. Nio also has made some price cuts in the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>Nio delivered 23,520 vehicles in Q2, in the lower half of its target for 23,000 to 25,000.</p>
      <p>Xpeng delivered 8,620 vehicles in June, up 14.8% vs. May. That's the fifth straight month-to-month gain, though sales tumbled 44% vs. a year earlier. Q2 deliveries of 23,205 vehicles sank nearly one-third vs. a year earlier. But they were above XPeng's guidance range for 21,000 to 22,000 vehicles.</p>
      <p>The EV maker has high hopes for its G6 crossover, which will begin deliveries in July. It's priced to sell, significantly cheaper than its direct rival, the Tesla Model Y.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, EV giant BYD is expected to report record monthly and quarterly sales, perhaps around 250,000 EVs in June.</p>
      <p>Li Auto stock rose 5.7% to 35.10 last week, at its best levels in nearly 10 months. Nio stock surged almost 15% to 9.69, nearing its 200-day line. Xpeng stock vaulted 36% to 13.42, clearing a seven-month consolidation.</p>
      <p>BYD stock fell 1.7% to 32 last week, but did bounce from its 50-day line on Friday. Shares are in range from a 31.07 buy point.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Deliveries</h3>
      <p>Tesla deliveries for the second quarter are expected to rise to roughly 445,000, according to FactSet. That would be up from 422,875 in Q1 and 405,278 in Q4.</p>
      <p>After huge price cuts worldwide in Q1, Tesla made some official price cuts and a few modest price hikes in Q2. But it offered substantial discounts on inventory, along with other incentives that could further pressure gross margins. But that won't be clear until the second-quarter earnings report in late July.</p>
      <p>Production likely exceeded deliveries once again, even with Tesla curbing output well below capacity. That suggests Tesla will need to keep cutting prices, especially if it wants to increase deliveries. An updated Model 3 and the Cybertruck are coming, but not quite yet.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock rose 2% to 261.77 this past week, even after tumbling 6.1% on Monday. Shares have more than doubled in 2023 and are well extended from recent buy points.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally staged an almost-textbook bullish rebound this past week. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all staged upside, outside weeks after testing or undercutting their 21-day moving averages. The S&P 500 hit a 14-month high while the Nasdaq reached a 14-month closing high. The Dow is just below its 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>The Russell 2000 didn't quite have an outside week, but roared toward recent highs.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) jumped 3.4%, hitting its best levels in nearly four months and outpacing the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) gained 2.8%, outpacing the Nasdaq 100's 1.9% advance.</p>
      <p>The Advance/decline lines, after weakening during the recent pullback, improved this past few days, especially on the NYSE.</p>
      <p>A large number of leading stocks from a variety of groups — chips, software, travel, housing, industrial, retail/restaurants and even some financials — broke out or flashed various buy signals.</p>
      <p>The only yellow flag is that the strong market rally is too strong.</p>
      <p>When the Nasdaq gets 6%-7% above its 50-day line, the risks of a pullback mount. In the past couple of years, the Nasdaq has sometimes stretched to 10% or more, as it did at its mid-June top. Because the market pullback was so shallow and brief, the Nasdaq is already 7.6% above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq 100, which includes Apple stock, Nvidia, Tesla and other big-cap players, is 8.3% above the 50-day line.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500, at 5.3% above the 50-day line, is close to being extended as well.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The short-lived stock market pullback created a slew of buying opportunities from a variety of sectors.</p>
      <p>Investors could have added some exposure in the past few days. You can still do so, but do so gradually, and be ready to cut losses quickly. There is already an elevated risk of another market pullback.</p>
      <p>In Mike Webster's return to IBD Live on Friday, he discussed the importance of grading your stocks or potential buys via a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Review your portfolio to see which stocks you may want to cut loose and which you'd like to add to.</p>
      <p>Run your screens and beef up your watchlists. Pay close attention to stocks near or in buy zones that merit an A grade.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The major stock market indexes closed strong, with all major indexes holding steady or picking up steam in the final hour of the second quarter.</p>
    	<p>The day started on a firm footing after inflation data came out mostly in line with expectations and showed signs of slowing down.</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq rose 1.5% to close out the trading day, as Big Tech stocks saw strength. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged with a 0.8% gain, and was pulled down by Nike (NKE).</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 rallied 1.2%. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.6%.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq finished the first half of 2023 up an impressive 31.7%, and the best first half since 1983.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 posted a 16% six-month gain. Over 72% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-day moving averages, in preliminary numbers.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones lagged with a modest 3.9% six-month increase while the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 7.6%.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) gained 1.5%. It jumped 38.8% in the first half, the biggest gain on record since 1986. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted ETF (QQEW) popped 1.2%, indicating broad participation in today's rally.</p>
      <p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gained 1.8%, outperforming the market indexes. NYSE volume was lower and Nasdaq volume was higher, compared with the same time on Thursday, in preliminary numbers.</p>
      <p>The May personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index rose 0.1% vs. the 0.2% expected. That dropped the annual inflation rate to 3.8%, meeting expectations and down from a revised 4.3% in April. That's the lowest rate since April 2021.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield shed 4 basis points to 3.82%. The CME FedWatch Tool showed over 80% odds for a quarter-point hike at the July Fed meeting.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action: Aircraft Stock Flies To A High</h3>
      <p>IBD 50 company FTAI Aviation (FTAI) soared 2.9% and hit a 52-week high. Shares are in the 5% buy zone of a flat base with a buy point of 30.26, which reaches to 31.77.</p>
      <p>The relative strength line also hit a new high as shown by the blue dot on the weekly chart, according to MarketSmith pattern recognition.</p>
      <p>Analysts expect the company to earn $1.45 a share this year vs. a loss of $2.24 in 2022. The company leases aircraft and jet engines, making it a complement to the hot airline industry.</p>
      <p>Nike fell 2.7% in heavy volume, after reporting worse-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings late Thursday. Several analysts cut their price targets on the stock. Shares dropped below the 200-day moving average.</p>
      <p><strong>Visa (V) </strong>rose 1.4% as the stock broke out of a flat base, hitting the 235.57 buy point. The stock is in the buy zone, which reaches to 247.35. Shares retook the 50-day moving average on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The move came after the company reported on Wednesday it will acquire cloud-based processing and banking platform Pismo for $1 billion in cash.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Movers: Cruise Line Stocks Sail Onward</h3>
      <p><strong>Carnival (CCL) </strong>surged 9.7% in heavy volume, after Jefferies upgraded the cruise line stock to a buy from a hold rating and raised its price target to 25 from 9.</p>
      <p>Shares are well extended from a cup base with a 12.62 buy point. The IBD 50 stock is up more than 130% this year so far.</p>
      <p><strong>Royal Caribbean Group (RCL), </strong>also in the IBD 50, jumped on board Carnival's rally, and rose 2.2%.</p>
      <p><strong>Nvidia (NVDA) </strong>gained another 3.6% after Daiwa Capital upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and raised its price target to 475 from 408.</p>
      <p>Chinese EV maker <strong>XPeng (XPEV) </strong>gapped up 13.4% in heavy volume after launching its G6 Ultra Smart Coupe SUV Thursday.</p>
      <p><strong>Tidewater (TDW)</strong> jumped past the 51.88 buy point of an undefined base in heavy trading. A handle entry at 51.13 is another viable buy point. The provider of support vessels for offshore drillers is expected to continue expanding its bottom line. Analysts expect the company to earn $3.18 a share this year vs. 22 cents in 2022.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE (^FTSE), European stock markets, and Wall Street spent the final day of the week, month, quarter, and half year in positive territory, as new data confirmed that the UK avoided recession over the winter, while eurozone inflation fell to 5.5%.</p>
    	<p>London's benchmark index rose 0.8% during the session, while the CAC (^FCHI) gained 1.4% in Paris, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) was also 1.4% higher.</p>	
    	<p>Across the pond, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) surged 1.3% thanks to Apple (AAPL) crossing the $3trn market cap mark again. The Dow Jones (^DJI) edged almost 0.7% higher by the time of the European close.</p>	
    	<p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday morning, the British economy grew by 0.1% in the first three months of this year, as well as in the final quarter of 2022.</p>
      <p>“Any growth is good but remember this growth still leaves the UK economy struggling to make up the ground it lost during the pandemic, and although we are in the same boat as Germany, the failure to have properly capitalised on the reopening momentum is cause for concern," said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.</p>
      <p>It came as Nationwide reported that UK property prices are down 3.5% on an annual basis on the back of sharp increases in borrowing costs.</p>
      <p>Compared with June last year, house prices were down 3.5%, largely unchanged from the 3.4% in the previous month, however prices did rise 0.1% between May and June.</p>
      <p>The average house price was £262,239 in June, with London having the second-sharpest year-on-year decline, at 4.3%.</p>
      <p>Nationwide’s chief economist Robert Gardner said: “Longer term interest rates, which underpin mortgage pricing, have increased sharply in recent months, in response to data indicating that underlying inflation in the UK economy is not moderating as fast as expected.</p>
      <p>The average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate on Friday is 6.39%, up from 6.37% on Thursday, according to financial information website Moneyfacts.</p>
      <p>The average five-year fixed residential mortgage rate is 5.96%, up from 5.94% on Thursday, as it approaches the 6% mark.</p>

      <h3>Aldi joins Tesco in price drops</h3>
      <p>Aldi has reduced the price of milk after Tesco announced a string of price cuts earlier today.</p>
      <p>The German grocer said it was lowering a four-pint bottle of milk by 10p, from £1.55 to £1.45. Its two-pint bottles will also fall to £1.20, down from £1.25, and its six-pint bottles will reduce from £2.30 to £2.15.</p>
      <h3>US PCE inflation rate eases</h3>
      <p>The latest from across the pond shows us that price pressures in America have eased...</p>
      <p>The PCE price index rose by a marginal 0.1% in May - 3.8% higher on an annual basis and down from 4.3% in the year to April.</p>
      <p>This could encourage Federal Reserve policymakers not to hike interest rates in the coming months, after keeping them steady in June.</p>
      <p>Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.3% during the period, however, the annual rate fell from 4.7% to 4.6%.</p>
      <h3>Apple hits $3trn market cap</h3>
      <p>Apple’s market capitalisation has surpassed $3trn again on Friday, thanks to growing optimism around its virtual reality headsets.</p>
      <p>Shares rose as much as 1.6% in New York to 192.61, taking its total valuation to $3.03 trillion.</p>
      <p>Apple was the first company to hit a $3 trillion market cap during intraday trading in January 2022.</p>
      <p>The stock is up around 54% year-to-date, at the time of writing.</p>
      <h3>Tesco announces price cuts</h3>
      <p>Tesco has said it will cut the prices of more than 500 household essentials, including packs of own-brand pasta, tinned tuna, milk, grapes, cheese and other goods by an average of 13%.</p>
      <p>Britain’s biggest supermarket said it was working with suppliers to pass on reductions where possible.</p>
      <p><strong>Tesco chief product officer, Ashwin Prasad, said: “We know that more than ever our customers are looking for great value, and this huge round of price cuts on 500 key household essentials will help their budgets go a little further.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“With price cuts on products like grapes, peppers, rice and tuna, customers will find it’s even cheaper to eat healthily with Tesco this summer.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“And we’ll continue to work closely with our suppliers to pass on price cuts to our customers whenever we can.”</strong></p>
      <h3>The UK banks offering best saving rates...</h3>
      <p>Surging interest rates bring misery to mortgage holders but for savers it means higher returns as banks are starting to pass on increases through saving rates.</p>
      <p>Some savings accounts are now paying out some of the highest interest rates seen in decades and there are a number of different savings accounts available and suitable for a variety of circumstances.</p>
      <p>Major lenders are now offering some of the UK’s top interest rates on savings accounts.</p>
      <p>Lloyds (LLOY.L) and NatWest (NWG.L) have begun offering 6.25% and 6.17% interest respectively on regular savings accounts, after HSBC (HSBA.L) online arm First Direct launched a 7% deal.</p>
      <h3>Wall Street set to open higher</h3>
      <p>US stocks are going to open in an hour. Here's how things are looking...</p>
      <p>S&P 500 futures (ES=F) are up 0.4%, Dow futures (YM=F) have gained 0.3%, and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) are 0.5% higher an hour before the bell in New York.</p>
      <p>Traders will be looking ahead to core PCE Deflator and personal spending numbers for May. Core PCE Deflator is forecast to remain unchanged at 4.7%, while personal spending is expected to slow from 0.8% to 0.2%</p>
      <h3>Speaking on the Adobe-Figma deal, Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, says:</h3>
      <p>“The news that the CMA wants to refer this deal to a deeper probe should not come as a surprise. You just have to look at their actions over the past year, and in particular with the Microsoft and Activision deal to see that the CMA is carving itself out a role as a regulator with the highest standards of consumer protection anywhere in the world.</p>
      <p>As the tech industry has matured, regulators are responding by being a lot pickier with the deals they will approve. If the Facebook purchase of Instagram happened today then it likely would have been blocked, and it is this environment that the likes of Adobe may find themselves struggling to navigate.</p>
      <p>“This deal, as important as it is for Adobe, was always going to struggle to meet the high bar set by the CMA. Strategically it makes sense that they wish to buy Figma as collaboration has become so critical in the post-COVID world, and where remote working has become the norm. It will be difficult to satisfy the CMA and as such structural remedies will be required to get it through.</p>
      <p>This may mean that the deal no longer becomes as attractive for Adobe, but we will need to see their response first to see what avenues they believe they have. For investors in Adobe, this will be a cloud hanging over the company for a considerable period of time and if they were not to end up buying Figma it would leave the company deficient in this fast growing product area.”</p>
      <h3>Adobe-Figma tie-up could harm UK digital economy</h3>
      <p>The proposed merger of software giant Adobe (ADBE) and design tools provider Figma may harm Britain's digital economy and mean less choice for designers of digital apps, websites and other products, the UK's Competitions and Markets Authority has warned.</p>
      <p>Adobe, creator of Photoshop and Illustrator, said it would buy Figma for $20 billion ($15.8 billion) in September last year.</p>
      <p>The regulator said it had "identified concerns" about the deal and found that Figma has established a substantial share of the market for screen design software and that Adobe has been continuously investing in and competing in this segment.</p>
      <p>As such, the CMA argues that competition between Figma and Adobe has driven investment in updating and developing screen design software. The rivalry could be lost if the deal goes ahead.</p>
      <h3>HMRC: Residential transactions decline</h3>
      <p>UK residential transactions in May came in at 80,020, 27% lower than May 2022 and 3% lower than April 2023.</p>
      <p>The provisional seasonally adjusted estimate of the number of UK non-residential transactions in May 2023 was 9,460, 16% lower than May 2022 and less than 1% lower than April 2023.</p>
      <p>HMRC said the annual fall “is partly due to higher number of bank holidays in May 2023, but also represents the decline in general market conditions in recent months”.</p>
      <p>Nick Leeming, chairman of Jackson-Stops, commented:</p>
      <p>“We find ourselves in a committed market, one where transactions will continue to complete and is dominated by buyers that have clear intentions of moving. As stamp duty relief and low interest rates stoked the fire of the property boom during lockdown, creating a frenzied sellers’ market unlike anything seen before, today we find ourselves in very different circumstances.</p>
      <p>A more subdued economic environment has meant that while transactions are continuing to take place, those not forced to move are waiting for the dust to settle, keeping the pace much more balanced between the volume of buyers and sellers.</p>
      <h3>Centrica rises after doubling gas storage capacity</h3>
      <p>Sticking with company news... Centrica (CNA.L) shares rose today after it announced a near doubling in gas storage capacity at its Rough facility.</p>
      <p>The British Gas owner has increased storage capacity at Rough, the UK's largest gas storage facility, to 54 billion cubic ft (bcf) in a bid to boost resilience in the coming winter.</p>
      <p>Closed in 2017, the site was partially reopened last year, when it was able to store around 30 bcf of gas.</p>
      <p>The facility will now provide the equivalent volume of gas to heat 2.4 million homes over winter, the company said.</p>
      <p>Centrica group chief executive Chris O’Shea said: “The resilience of the UK’s energy system needs to be substantially improved.</p>
      <p>“Rough is not a silver bullet for energy security, but it plays a critical role in increasing capacity and supply confidence over the winter months.”</p>
      <h3>WH Smith says it won't open more high street stores</h3>
      <p>WH Smith (SMWH.L) has said it is not planning to open any more high street stores, saying doing so would risk “duplication” in many city centres.</p>
      <p>Instead, chief executive Carl Cowling told the BBC that the historic chain would be concentrating on airports and train stations.</p>
      <p>WH Smith has about 550 high street stores in the UK with all the main cities in England, Wales and Scotland having shops.</p>
      <p>In its latest trading update, it said that, in the 13 weeks to the end of May, total revenue from UK travel locations was up 24% on last year.</p>
      <h3>Heathrow Airport names new boss</h3>
      <p>Heathrow has announced it has taken on the boss of Copenhagen Airport as its new chief executive.</p>
      <p>Thomas Woldbye is set to replace John Holland-Kaye when he steps down later this year.</p>
      <p>The UK's busiest airport said his “ability to navigate complex stakeholder relationships has been a key factor in his success” at Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>Lord Paul Deighton, Heathrow chairman, said: “Thomas’s achievements at Copenhagen not only mirror Heathrow’s long-term strategy, but his track record in successfully running a major airport and working closely with stakeholders to secure consensus and deliver positive results stood out in the selection process.”</p>
      <h3>Eurozone inflation falls to 5.5%</h3>
      <p>News just in from the Eurozone... and inflation has fallen by more than expected again thanks to a drop in energy prices.</p>
      <p>Consumer prices across the euro area increased by 5.5% in the year to June, down from 6.1% in May. This was lower than the 5.6% expected.</p>
      <p>Eurostat revealed that food, alcohol and tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in June – at 11.7%, down from 12.5% in May.</p>
      <p>Industrial goods inflation eased 5.8% to 5.5% while the service sector inflation rose to 5.4%, up from 5.0% the previous month.</p>
      <p>Energy prices also fell at a faster rate than last month, with energy inflation dropping to -5.6% from -1.8% in May.</p>
      <h3>UK energy bills warning</h3>
      <p>Energy prices for the typical UK home are likely to remain high for the foreseeable future with supplies vulnerable to external shocks, Centrica CEO Chris O'Shea has said.</p>
      <p>My colleague Lucy Harley-McKeown writes...</p>
      <p>As Ofgem's new price cap comes into effect this weekend, the average UK home's bills will be £2,074 — below the £2,500 level which was subsidised by the government under the energy price guarantee scheme.</p>
      <p>Even under the price cap, household energy bills will remain £800 more expensive than two years ago.</p>
      <h3>Brits pulling out of savings accounts</h3>
      <p>UK households raced to pull cash from their savings accounts at a record level as they shop around for options with better returns, the ONS said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The household saving ratio stood at 8.7% in the latest quarter, down from 9.3% in Q4 2022, while the amount of new mortgage and re-mortgage borrowing fell.</p>
      <p>“Households are making record withdrawals from interest-bearing sight deposits held with UK banks and building societies, instead moving their money to higher interest, time deposit accounts, such as with National Savings and Investments," it said.</p>
      <h3>UK 0.5% smaller than before pandemic</h3>
      <p>The UK economy is still 0.5% smaller than it was at the end of 2019. Here is a brief rundown of how the G7 is looking after Q1:</p>
      <p>Canada: grew by 0.8%</p>
      <p>France: grew by 0.2%</p>
      <p>Germany: contracted by 0.3%</p>
      <p>Italy: grew by 0.6%</p>
      <p>Japan: grew by 0.7%</p>
      <p>United Kingdom: grew by 0.1%</p>
      <p>United States: grew by 0.3%</p>
      <h3>UK economy avoids recession in Q1</h3>
      <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed this morning that the British economy grew by 0.1% in the first quarter of the year, as well as the final quarter of 2022.</p>
      <p>The latest account matches the initial estimate, and means that the UK avoided recession in the cost of living crisis last winter.</p>
      <p>"In output terms, the services sector grew by 0.1% on the quarter driven by increases in information and communication, and administrative and support service activities; elsewhere, the construction sector grew by a revised 0.4% (previously 0.7%), while the production sector grew by 0.1%, with a revised 0.6% growth in manufacturing (previously 0.5%)," the ONS said.</p>
      <p>But analysts are still warning that a recession may still be on the cards.</p>
      <p>Ashley Webb at Capital Economics said: "...With around 60% of the drag from higher interest rates yet to be felt, we still think the economy will tip into one in the second half of this year involving a peak-to-trough fall of around 0.5%."</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 275 points Friday after the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation indicator, the PCE price index, came out before the market open.</p>
    	<p>Meanwhile, Nike stock fell sharply after missing earnings views. And the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is trying to break out above its recent trading range during the second quarter's final session.</p>	
    	<p>Early Friday, the Commerce Department's personal income and outlays report for May was released. Personal income rose 0.4%, in line with estimates. The PCE price index rose 0.1% on the month, with an annual increase of 3.8%. Both numbers met estimates. Further, the core PCE price index rose 0.3% on the month, with a 4.6% annual increase, both slightly cooler than expected.</p>	
    	<p>Dow Jones giant Nike (NKE) wrapped up its 2023 fiscal year with mixed fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Nike stock received multiple price target downgrades last week as inventory issues remain the Achilles heel for the Dow Jones athletic shoe and apparel giant. Shares declined more than 2% in early trade Friday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Constellation Brands (STZ) was down around 1.4% after its fiscal first-quarter results.</p>

      <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) added 2% Friday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were higher after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Other leaders in the stock market rally include Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META). Alphabet shares and Meta stock both rose sharply in morning trade.</p>
      <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), MongoDB (MDB) and Lam Research (LRCX) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market pullback.</p>
      <p>Tesla is an IBD Leaderboard stock, Lam Research remains an IBD SwingTrader stock, while MongoDB is featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Friday's opening bell, ahead of the holiday-interrupted July 4 week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%, while the S&P 500 futures climbed 1.2%. The Nasdaq moved up 1.6% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded up 1.6%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rose 1.2% early Friday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield briefly ticked higher to 3.87%, trying to break out above its recent trading range ahead of the final session of the second quarter. The yield settled higher Thursday at 3.85%, its highest closing level since early March.</p>
      <p>Oil prices rose modestly Friday morning, continuing to hold near recent lows. West Texas Intermediate futures traded just above $70 a barrel, effectively flat for the week and down not quite 4% from a June 21 high.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average led the stock market higher, rallying 0.8%. In the Dow 30, Intel (INTC) slid 2%, falling further below its 33.84 buy point. So far, however, there is no sell signal.</p>
      <p>On the upside, Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase were big gainers, rallying on Fed stress test news. Goldman shares rallied 3% but remain below their 50-day line. JPM stock advanced 3.5%, bouncing off the 50-day line and again topping a flat base's 143.37 entry.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the S&P 500 climbed nearly 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite ended slightly lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 moved up 1.2%, with help from rising regional banks.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "This week, the Nasdaq successfully defended support at the 21-day exponential moving average, which should offer a shot of confidence to investors. With the ongoing stock market pullback still in normal shape, IBD's recommended market exposure still sits at 60%-80%."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column as the stock market remains in an uptrend but is pulling back.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: JPMorgan, Merck, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones banking leader JPMorgan regained a 143.37 flat-base buy point during Thursday's big gains. The 5% buy zone goes up to 150.54. JPM stock rose 0.4% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Drug giant Merck is forming a flat base with a 119.65 buy point, as the stock climbed 1% Thursday. An early entry at 114.91 is also in play. MRK stock inched lower Friday.</p>
      <p>Salesforce managed to steady itself after slumping following earnings. It is now testing support at the 50-day line. The megacap tech previously moved past a pair of alternative entries at 194.01 and at 200.10, according to IBD Leaderboard analysis.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry. CRM stock rose 0.8% Friday morning.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Chipotle, MongoDB, Lam Research</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Chipotle rebounded from support at its 10-week line and is building a flat base with a 2,139.88 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition.</p>
      <p>An early entry at 2,092.51 was also available due to a trendline. Chipotle was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day. CMG stock gained 0.6% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>IBD SwingTrader stock Lam Research moved above a 615.80 early buy point and a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 630.72 entry during this week's gains. LRCX stock climbed 0.7% early Friday.</p>
      <p>MongoDB is trading tightly after its recent earnings-fueled jump, offering a new entry. The three-weeks-tight formation shows a buy point at 398.89, while aggressive investors could have used a trendline entry around 386. MDB stock moved up 2.9% Friday morning.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla extended a win streak to three sessions Thursday, rising 0.5%. Amid the recent rebound, Tesla shares remain sharply out of buy range beyond a double-bottom's 207.79 buy point.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock looked to add to Thursday's gains, rising more than 2% Friday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock hit another record high Thursday, trading as high as 190.07. Shares continue to hold sharply above a 157.38 buy point. Early Friday, shares climbed 1.4% after Citi started coverage on AAPL stock with a buy rating and a 240 price target.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares slipped 0.2% Thursday, ending a two-day rebound. On June 16, MSFT stock hit an all-time high at 351.47.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, the stock reached the 20% to 25% profit zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors could have taken at least some profits there. And on Friday morning, Microsoft shares were up 1.7%.</p>

    	<p><strong>This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The chart of the day</li>
        <li>What we're watching</li>
        <li>What we're reading</li>
        <li>Economic data releases and earnings</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed in the red Wednesday, giving back a small portion of its near-30% gains so far this year. And as we approach the end of the second quarter, 2023 is shaping up to be a year for the record books.</p>	
    	<p>Double-digit gains alone would be something to tweet home about, given concerns over the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting hawkishness at the beginning of the year (concerns that persist, by the way).</p>	
    	<p>But it's the way in which the market delivered these returns that yields an unexpected historical analysis — one that suggests the tech-heavy Nasdaq may add to its impressive six-month tally in the back half of this year.</p>
      <p>The above chart plots the returns of the Nasdaq Composite for the first half of the year (purple) versus the second-half performance (orange). The first half of 2023 is posting the third-highest return after 1975 (45%) and 1983 (37%).</p>
      <p>What immediately stands out are the big declines after each of the top two years (-11% and -13%, respectively). The fifth-best year (1986) also had a large decline of 14% in the second half after a 25% run in the first half.</p>
      <p>Might a similar bearish fate await investors in the third and fourth quarters of this year?</p>
      <p>Peering into the price action of those "big up, big down" years reveals a decidedly different picture than what has evolved this year.</p>
      <p>In 1986, price largely ticked smoothly upwards over the first two quarters, closely hugging the 10-day moving average (a technical indicator used to smooth jagged price action). Might the run-up have been too perfect?</p>
      <p>Climbing the wall of worry as in the chart above is usually fraught with increasing risk the longer price advances with nary a material pullback.</p>
      <p>Back to the present, the price action this year has been a bit choppier, with price moving largely sideways to down from the February peak until the break to the upside in May.</p>
      <p>If a one-sided market is prone to reversal. Perhaps a more balanced market that both waxes and wanes is the fuel that the bulls need.</p>
      <p>Bespoke Investment Group published a similar finding Monday with their Chart of the Day. They found that if you add up the number of winning days over the first six months of the year, a higher winning percentage counterintuitively signals a lower likelihood of positive returns in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>Bespoke concludes, "Based on the Nasdaq’s prior history, the less routine positive days were during strong first halves, the more likely it was to continue rallying in the second half."</p>
      <p>This jives with our general theory of markets that too much of a good thing doesn't last. At the very least, this year's impressive gains aren't necessarily the headwind that some claim.</p>

    	<p>China bulls are pushing back their expectations for a rally in stock prices as the economy struggles and global funds turn away as policymakers avoid opening the stimulus floodgates.</p>
    	<p>HSBC this week trimmed its year-end index target for the CSI 300 Index by 6.5 per cent to 4,300 and lowered its target for the Shanghai Composite Index by 2.8 per cent to 3,500. Citigroup dialled back its optimism on the Hang Seng Index, scaling back its target to 22,000, versus a forecast of 24,000 in February.</p>
      <p>That further narrowed the upside potential for investors, as money managers have already shifted their focus to India and Japan in search of higher returns. The MSCI China Index tracking over 700 companies listed at home and abroad has tumbled 9.4 per cent during the past three months, set for the worst quarter since Beijing's zero-Covid pivot in October. Local stock benchmarks have both fallen more than 5 per cent during the same period, ranking among the worst performers in Asia.</p>

    	<p>"We have previously argued the market will be driven by fundamentals," HSBC analysts including Steven Sun said in a note to clients on Wednesday. "That has not played out yet, and the economic backdrop has gotten tougher."</p>
      <p>China's post-pandemic recovery continues to disappoint, with manufacturing set to contract for a third month in June, according to economists before a government report on Friday. Policymakers are reluctant to roll out a larger stimulus package, prompting Wall Street brokers from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to rein in their bullish forecasts.</p>
	    <p>Foreign investors only bought 1.2 billion yuan (US$170 million) worth of mainland stocks this quarter through June 27, according to Stock Connect data. Global hedge funds have taken back about 70 per cent of the money they ploughed into Chinese stocks since November, according to Goldman.</p>
      <p>China's markets reversed course from early gains and fell over 20 per cent in the first half on concerns over the sputtering cyclical recovery, Goldman said, while Asian markets are likely to face subdued third-quarter returns before a recovery in the final quarter.</p>
      <p>Parts of the Asian markets that have underperformed, including China, could see a "catch-up" rally, especially if policy eases further in China, it added.</p>
      <p>There is still a chance for the market to run up as bad news is mostly priced in and the valuation is now cheap, according to Timothy Moe, a Singapore-based strategist at Goldman. The MSCI China's price-to-earnings ratio now stands at 10.43, lower than the bank's fair value estimate.</p>
      <p>HSBC's Sun said a re-rating for Chinese stocks is possible in the last quarter. The disappointing fundamentals and tight liquidity caused by fund outflows will be major hurdles for the market to overcome before making any significant breakthrough, he added.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>European stocks and the FTSE 100 were mainly lower on Monday as Primark-owner Associated British Foods (ABF.L) raised its profit outlook after lifting prices.</p>
    	<p>Sales across the group have grown 17% so far this year, and were up 16% in the third quarter. ABF reported a 13% rise in Primark sales in its latest quarter.</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, the uncertain economic outlook continues to weigh on investors after the Bank of England raised interest rates by half a point last week, following the Fed and other central banks in increasing borrowing costs.</p>	
    	<h3>FTSE 100 and European stocks</h3>
      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was down 0.05% to 7,458.43 points. The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris fell 0.06% to 7,158.98 points, while in Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) edged up 0.01% to 7,158.98 points.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia markets</h3>
      <p>The main US indices closed in the red on Friday after disappointing data added to hesitance in the markets following more interest rate hikes by central banks.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) fell 0.65% to 33,727.43 points, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.77% to close at 4,348.33 points, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) dipped by 1.01% to 13,492.52.</p>
      <p>In Asia, the markets were lower overnight. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) fell 0.25% to 32,698.81 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong lost 0.41% to 18,811.65. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) declined by 1.50% to 3,149.80 points.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound to dollar exchange rate (GBPUSD=X) rose to 1.27 in early trade, meaning £1 will get you $1.27. Meanwhile the pound to euro exchange rate (GBPEUR=X) fell to 1.16.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Oil prices rose in early trade on Monday as output cuts offset demand concerns stemming from weak Chinese export data.</p>
      <p>US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), gained 0.85% to trade at $69.75 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) rose 0.97% to $74.57 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Trending tickers</h3>
      <p>AB Foods (ABF.L), Cineworld (CINE.L), Aston Martin Lagonda (AML.L) and BAE Systems (BA.L) are among the stocks investors are watching today, as Yahoo Finance's Pedro Goncalves reports.</p>
      <p>Primark owner AB Foods said its sales jumped over the latest quarter amid higher prices, and was now upgrading its full-year profit expectations.</p>
      <p>Primark posted a 13% increase in sales to £1.99bn ($2.5bn) for the 12 weeks to 27 May 2023, while like-for-like sales were up 7%, which it credited to “higher average selling prices”.</p>
      <p>Troubled cinema chain Cineworld has said it will file for administration in the UK as part of a restructuring plan that is set to wipe out shareholders.</p>
      <p>The world’s second largest cinema chain said it will apply for administration for the London-listed company in July, which will see shares in the firm suspended.</p>
      <p>Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has struck an electric vehicle (EV) supply deal to create “industry-leading ultra-luxury high performance electric vehicles.”</p>
      <p>As part of the agreement, US-based EV maker Lucid will supply Aston Martin with select powertrain components for initial and some future battery-electric models. Shares jumped 10%.</p>
      <p>While BAE Systems was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) index in London, down 3% as shares in European defence companies fell after the apparent Wagner 'mutiny' in Russia.</p>
      <h3>Asia economic outlook</h3>
      <p>ANZ Research has trimmed its GDP growth forecasts for 2023 to reflect the ongoing weakness in economic activity in China.</p>
      <p>“We have trimmed our GDP growth forecast for the region to 4.6 % in 2023, from 4.9% previously. The downgrade primarily resides in China’s economy, whose growth we have marked down to 4.9%, from 5.4% previously. The economic data from China spanning PMI, private sector investment and youth employment have been unusually weak, confirming a short-lived post-pandemic re-opening bounce.</p>
      <p>“The changes to growth forecasts in Asia ex-China are minimal. In fact, GDP growth in some economies surpassed expectations in Q1 2023 owing to sustained strength in household consumption and an improving contribution from ‘net exports’. India’s growth deviated slightly from this pattern in that household consumption remained sub-par,” ANZ said in a report sent to clients on Monday.</p>
      <h3>ECB Forum on Central Banking 2023</h3>
      <p>Traders will also be keeping across the European Central Bank (ECB) Forum on Central Banking which starts in Portugal this evening for any suggestions on where interest rates may go next.</p>
      <p>European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, will be delivering the opening remarks and there will be a speech by Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
      <p>The ECB lifted interest rates by another quarter-point on 15 June and Lagarde described a further hike in July as “very likely.”</p>
      <p>The forum will end on 28 June.</p>
      <h3>Lidl injunction allowed against Tesco</h3>
      <p>London's High Court has granted Lidl permission to have an injunction to stop Tesco copying its logo.</p>
      <p>In April, Tesco lost a trademark lawsuit brought by its supermarket rival after adopting a yellow circle against a blue background to promote its "Clubcard Prices" discount scheme.</p>
      <p>The judge said Tesco would have nine weeks to remove all Clubcard Prices logos once the proceedings are over, if Tesco is unsuccessful on appeal.</p>
      <h3>Average mortgage rates rise</h3>
      <p>The average two-year fixed residential mortgage rate is 6.23% - up from 6.01% this time last week, while the average five-year fixed residential mortgage is 5.86%, from 5.67% a week ago, according to new data from Moneyfacts.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Bank of England (BoE) increased UK interest rates for a thirteenth consecutive time last week, announcing a 0.5% hike to 5%. Rates are now at a 15-year high as the Bank looks to combat high inflation and cool the cost of living crisis.</p>
      <h3>'Fed on track for July rate hike'</h3>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference to discuss an announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee, in Washington. Photo: AP.</p>
      <p>US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a hawkish chord with lawmakers last week telling them the central bank will do what it takes to get inflation down to 2%, which will likely require two more 25bp rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Powell said he hadn’t seen much tightening in credit conditions flowing on from recent bank failures, but he will be watching matters closely.</p>
      <p>"This latest instalment of the Dallas Fed’s Banking Conditions Survey, out this week, will test his thesis," an ANZ Research note said on Monday.</p>
      <p>ANZ also highlighted that US PCE inflation data will be in focus this week.</p>
      <p>"Headline PCE inflation is expected to ease to 0.1% m/m in May from 0.4% in April. Core services ex-housing has been sticky at an elevated level for some time. Nominal personal income and spending are likely to increase by 0.4% and 0.2% respectively.</p>
      <p>"Durable goods orders are expected to decline by 1% m/m in May after a 1.1% rise in April mainly driven by a jump in defence aircraft orders. New home sales are expected to decline in May after two consecutive months of gains in month-on-month terms," ANZ said.</p>
      <h3>"Stock markets undented by Russia 'mutiny'"</h3>
      <p>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the owner of the Wagner Group military company, pictured in Moscow, Russia, on April 8, 2023. Photo: AP.</p>
      <p>Some media outlets reported at the weekend that Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had turned on Russian president Vladimir Putin and attempted a mutiny. However, numerous experts highlighted that the 'mutiny' may have all been orchestrated and part of Putin's plan.</p>
      <p>Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Sky News that the exile of Prigozhin to Belarus may mask future "lethal" events.</p>
      <p>He said: "We cannot dismiss the possibility that this was actually an orchestrated event by the Kremlin — perhaps to do some house cleaning of top officials, but also to test the loyalty of people in the military, of other officials."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the 'uprising' in Russia could have sent shockwaves across equity and commodity markets but the apparent U-turn has meant only marginal volatility rather than a full-blown correction.</p>
      <p>“Brent Crude had fallen by more than 4% over the past five days on fears about global economic weakness and how that would negatively impact demand. However, the oil price jumped 0.8% to $74.41 per barrel on Monday as markets contemplated a new period of uncertainty for supply," he said.</p>
      <h3>Aston Martin shares climb</h3>
      <p>Shares in Aston Martin rose nearly 11% on Monday after the luxury carmaker confirmed it is entering into a strategic supply agreement with Lucid Group to manufacture high performance electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “Aston Martin shares continued their strong run, now up more than 130% year-to-date. Driving the latest rally is a deal with US group Lucid to make high performance electric vehicles. Lucid is to supply powertrain components in exchange for $232m cash and 28.4 million shares, making it a 3.7% shareholder in Aston Martin.</p>
      <p>“It’s the latest in a string of strategic initiatives designed to make the iconic British car maker more relevant in the modern age, having recently struck a partnership with Geely to access technologies and components and have a bigger foot in the door in China.”</p>
      <h3>Mortgage help for home owners</h3>
      <p>The UK chancellor held crisis talks with mortgage lenders on Friday to help manage the spiralling costs for home owners.</p>
      <p>Among other measures, he said that lenders had agreed to allow borrowers to extend the term of their mortgages or move to an interest-only plan temporarily.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, prime minister Rishi Sunak said Britons should "hold our nerve" on high interest rates. He added there is "no alternative" to quelling inflation.</p>
      <h3>Hunt meeting regulators</h3>
      <p>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to meet a group of regulators this week to examine what they are doing about companies exploiting rapid inflation.</p>
      <p>As Lucy Harley-McKeown reports, he will meet the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), alongside Ofgem, Ofwat and Ofcom on Wednesday, to combat both existing and future price rises for consumers in response to claims that companies are profiteering at a time when consumers are struggling.</p>
      <p>The news comes as the rate of inflation in the UK remains at 8.7%.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates again to a 15-year high, from 4.5% to 5%, to try to bring it under control.</p>
      <h3>Economic data</h3>
      <p>The German IFO business Climate number, which measures the state of Germany's business environment on a monthly basis, confirmed more weakness this morning.</p>
      <p>It fell to 88.4 in June from 91.5 in May (revised from 91.7), weaker than the market expectation of 90.7.</p>
      <p>"Traders were already worried about the slowdown in the economic activity in the Eurozone and the hawkish monetary policy adopted by the ECB. The fact that today’s number has confirmed that the economic engine of the Eurozone is running out of gas is a matter of grave concern for investors," Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>TOKYO (AP) — Global shares mostly fell Monday after a short-lived armed rebellion in Russia added to uncertainties over the war in Ukraine.</p>
    	<p>France's CAC 40 dipped 0.4% in early trading to 7,135.23. Germany's DAX slipped 0.2% to 15,797.27. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.8% to 7,403.10. The futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%.</p>	
    	<p>The rebellion by mercenary soldiers who briefly took over a Russian military headquarters on an ominous march toward Moscow was over. But the brief weakened President Vladimir Putin just as his forces were facing a fierce counteroffensive in Ukraine.</p>	
    	<p>Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner troops were some of Russia’s most effective fighters in Ukraine. Their aborted takeover of the capital also left their fate uncertain.</p>
      <p>Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade, said such geopolitical uncertainties have set off a cautious mood.</p>
      <p>“On the back of recent hawkish central bank moves amid high inflation and low growth environments, investors are now also having to factor in the chance of escalation on the geopolitical side of things, which is adding another layer of uncertainty to the equation,” he said.</p>
      <p>Investors have been rattled, also by signs that Europe’s economy appears to be weaker than expected and by still more interest rates by central banks as they try to get inflation under control. High rates drive down inflation by slowing economic activity, which raises risks of recession.</p>
      <p>In Asian trading, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost nearly 0.3% to finish at 32,698.81. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.5% to 2,582.20. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.5% to 18,794.13, while the Shanghai Composite, reopening after a holiday, dropped 1.5% to 3,150.62. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.3% to 7,078.70.</p>
      <p>“We have a slowing U.S. economy, a slowing global economy, all with on-going extreme inflation and high and going higher interest rate levels. There is no bullish stock market scenario here,” said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities.</p>
      <p>High interest rates in the United States have already dragged manufacturing and other industries into contraction, while also helping to cause several failures in the banking system that rattled confidence.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that even though his central bank didn’t raise rates last week, it could still push through a couple more hikes by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>A preliminary report last week indicated the overall U.S. economy continues to grow, even though manufacturing is shrinking and its output fell to a five-month low.</p>
      <p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 11 cents to $69.27 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 35 cents to $69.16 on Friday. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 15 cents to $74.16 a barrel.</p>
      <p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 143.14 Japanese yen from 143.58 yen. The euro cost $1.0898, inching down from $1.0903.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>S&P 500 stocks Paccar (PCAR) and Parker Hannifin (PH) are in focus, along with Monday.com (MNDY), Shopify (SHOP) and HubSpot (HUBS).</p>
    	<p>The stock market rally saw generally modest losses last week after several weekly gains. So far, the pullback has been relatively calm. But until there are clear signs that it's winding down, investors generally should be cautious about making new purchases in the short run. But it's a good time to be watching stocks that are holding up relatively well.</p>	
    	<p>With the current market pullback, investors should be ready to cut losses quickly and move to take partial profits. However, stocks could also power ahead next week, which investors should also watch out for.</p>	
    	<p>S&P 500 stocks Paccar and Parker Hannifin are trading right around traditional buy points, along with Monday.com. Shopify and HubSpot are close to actionable entries as well. Some of them are extended from their 50-day moving averages and it remains to be seen if they will hold up in a buy zone if the market continues to slide.</p>
      <p>SHOP stock and HubSpot are on the IBD Leaderboard.</p>
      <h3>S&P 500: Parker Hannifin Stock</h3>
      <p>PH edged down 0.2% to 370.12 Friday during market trade. The stock edged up 0.3% for the week and has jumped 15.5% in June. Since March, the S&P 500 stock has formed a cup base and is just above an official 364.57 buy point, according to MarketSmith.</p>
      <p>Parker Hannifin stock has advanced 27% in 2023, hitting fresh highs. On June 2, the S&P 500 stock made a decisive move above its 50-day moving average and then cleared short-term levels on June 6. PH stock kept racing up to the buy point, but looked extended from moving averages. The 21-day line is catching up, but the 50-day line is still well below Parkin Hannifin stock.</p>
      <p>Parker Hannifin, a manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, provides engineered solutions for a plethora of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. The company has operations in 50 countries around the world.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share and sales have grown solidly on a year-over-year basis, with an acceleration in the most recent quarter. The Cleveland-based firm posted earnings growth of 11%, 7% and 23%, respectively, in the past three quarters. Meanwhile, revenue growth is accelerating, from 12% to 22% to 24% in the latest quarter.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 stock reports fiscal fourth-quarter financials in early August. Analysts expect profits to grow 5% to $5.44 per share with revenue jumping 19% to $4.99 billion.</p>
      <p>For the full fiscal year, Wall Street forecasts EPS climbing 11% to $22.87 and sales increasing 20% to $18.96 billion.</p>

      <h3>Shopify Stock</h3>
      <p>SHOP shares rose 0.5% to 63.79 on Friday, finding support at the 21-day line. The stock fell 1.4% on the week but is up 11.5% in June. Shopify stock has pulled back from a 65.54 buy point from a short consolidation, modestly above a cup-with-handle base.</p>
      <p>The Canada-based e-commerce software and services provider has seen its stock leap in June. SHOP shares also are trading around 14-month highs, surging nearly 24% on May 4 following first-quarter earnings and the announced sale of its fulfillment business to privately held Flexport.</p>
      <p>There's also speculation over a possible Shopify deal with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).</p>
      <p>Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for businesses. It partners with companies such as Stripe to handle digital payments. Well-funded and fast-growing Stripe has put off an initial public offering.</p>
      <p>Among its merchants services is Shop Pay. It's an accelerated checkout option for stores on the Shopify platform. Shopify Capital provides loans to merchants. The new Shop Cash rewards program provides consumers with incentives, aiming to boost GMV through higher orders.</p>
      <p>Analysts predict 2023 profits will soar 750% to 34 cents per share, up from 4 cents per share last year. Wall Street also forecasts sales increasing 20% to $6.73 billion in 2023. Those consensus forecasts have risen sharply.</p>
      <p>Shopify stock ranks 11th in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group. It has a 98 Composite Rating out of 99. SHOP has a 97 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating is 59 out of 99.</p>
      <h3>HubSpot Stock</h3>
      <p>HUBS shares slipped 1.2% to 512.21 on Friday. HubSpot stock on the week gained 0.5% and has dipped 1.1% in June. The stock has formed a four-weeks-tight pattern with a 535.12 buy point.</p>
      <p>The stock has ballooned 80% in 2023. HUBS, which has been trading tightly, has found support at the 21-day line in the past several sessions.</p>
      <p>HubSpot, headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., develops cloud-based platforms designed to help businesses develop processes for sales, marketing and customer service.</p>
      <p>On May 3, the company announced better-than expected Q1 financials. HubSpot reported first-quarter earnings at $1.20 a share, up 122% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 27% to $501.6 million.</p>
      <p>The rapid improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) have driven increased potential in the tech and software spaces for growth. HubSpot's software could particularly benefit from advancements in AI.</p>
      <p>Analysts forecast 2023 profits surging 74% to $4.84 per share and sales growing 21% to $2.09 billion.</p>
      <p>HUBS stock ranks second in IBD's Computer Software-Special Enterprises group. It has a 99 Composite Rating out of 99. The stock has a 96 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating is 99 out of 99.</p>
      <h3>S&P 500: Paccar Stock</h3>
      <p>PCAR shares edged up 0.4% to 78.44 Friday. Shares dipped 0.2% this week but have gained 14% in June. The S&P 500 stock is just above a flat base with an official 76.72 buy point. It's in buy range now, with a little more strength also breaking a short, high-handle downtrend. But the current market pullback raises the risks of any new buys.</p>
      <p>Paccar stock has advanced more than 18% since January. The S&P 500 stock hit an all-time high 80.15 on Thursday. Between March and early June, PCAR was trading tightly around its 50-day moving average. However, on June 2 the S&P 500 stock moved above that key level of resistance. PCAR is currently around 5% above its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>The commercial truck manufacturer operates under brands Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The company also designs and manufactures advanced diesel engines, provides financial services and distributes truck parts related to its core business.</p>
      <p>Paccar is also working on electric truck and autonomous long haul trucking options, with nine EV models in production.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 stock generated $28.8 billion in revenue in 2022. In Q1 2023, Paccar delivered 32% sales growth to just over $8 billion.</p>
      <p>Wall Street expects full-year EPS to grow 37% to $7.91 with sales vaulting 16% to $31.66 billion.</p>
      <p>Paccar stock is first in IBD's Trucks & Parts-Heavy Duty industry group. The S&P 500 stock has a 92 Composite Rating out of 99. The stock has an 87 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating for the S&P 500 stock is 91 out of 99.</p>

Shares are down 5.9% in June after skyrocketing 48% in May. Monday.com stock has formed a cup base with a 171.89 buy point, dropping below that key level on Friday.</p>
      <p>MNDY is up more than 43% in 2023 with shares on June 16 at their highest since March 2022. Shares gapped above the 50-day line on May 15, offering an early entry. After a brief pause, Monday.com raced higher again on May 23, offering another entry. Shares officially broke out on May 31, but it was greatly extended from the 50-day line. Even now, MNDY stock is 13% above that level.</p>
      <p>Israel-based Monday.com is a cloud-based platform that allows users to create their own applications and project management software. The company went public in June 2021.</p>
      <p>Monday.com first turned a profit in Q3 2022. MNDY is currently riding a string of three straight profitable quarters.</p>
      <p>In fiscal Q1 2023, Monday.com reported a surprise profit, topping earnings and revenue estimates. The company saw EPS of 14 cents, up from a 96-cent loss a year ago. Meanwhile, revenue jumped 49% to $162.3 million.</p>

    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dropped more than 250 points Friday after key economic data, with the major stock indexes eyeing a losing week as investors brace for future rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Tesla stock was downgraded to sell at DZ Bank.</p>
    	<p>On the economic front, S&P Global's preliminary June Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing and services indexes came out Friday morning. The manufacturing index fell to 46.3, below estimates for a 48.5 reading. The services index eased to 54.1, above estimates for a 53.5 reading.</p>	
    	<p>This week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell set the stage for higher interest rates in the coming months. On Wednesday, Powell reiterated that more interest rate increases are likely needed to bring down inflation, saying "Nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year."</p>	
    	<p>Investors now see a more-than-74% chance of a quarter-point hike at the Fed's July meeting, per CME FedWatch Tool. That's up from 67% one week ago.</p>
      <p>CarMax (KMX) raced 7% higher Friday after the company reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales results.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>EV giant Tesla (TSLA) dropped more than 4% Friday. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were lower after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), McKesson (MCK), MongoDB  (MDB) and Roku (ROKU) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to buy or watch in the ongoing stock market pullback.</p>
      <p>Tesla is an IBD Leaderboard stock. McKesson is an IBD SwingTrader stock, while Chipotle featured as Wednesday's Stock Of The Day as well as in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.7%. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dropped 1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded down 1%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) moved down 0.8% early Friday.</p>

      <p>Oil prices continued to back off Friday morning. West Texas Intermediate futures fell nearly 3%, to below $68 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, The Dow Jones Industrial Average cut back its early losses to close essentially flat. In the Dow 30, Boeing (BA) triggered the 7% loss rule from a 221.33 buy point. BA stock fell more than 3% to extend a losing streak to three sessions.</p>
      <p>Market performance varied by index. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite advanced nearly 1%. But the small-cap Russell 2000 moved down 0.8%.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column cautioned, "Despite the stock market pullback, IBD's recommended market exposure still sits at 60%-80%. So far, the market pullback is normal, but keep an eye out for more signs of institutional selling. If distribution days start to pile up, then it would be prudent to methodically reduce exposure."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column amid the ongoing stock market uptrend.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: JPMorgan, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones banking leader JPMorgan is just below a 143.37 flat-base buy point after Thursday's 1.9% drop. JPM stock fell 0.9% early Friday.</p>
      <p>Salesforce managed to steady itself after slumping following earnings. It is now testing support at the 21-day exponential moving average. The megacap tech previously moved past a pair of new alternative entries at 194.01 and at 200.10, according to IBD Leaderboard analysis.</p>

      <p>IBD SwingTrader stock McKesson is in buy range past a 401.53 cup-with-handle entry. The 5% buy zone goes up to 421.61. Shares were up 0.3% Friday.</p>

      <p>Streaming giant Roku is building a cup-with-handle base with a 75.45 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition, even as the stock extended a losing streak to six sessions Thursday. Roku stock fell 0.8% early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla rose 2% Thursday despite a Morgan Stanley downgrade, reversing higher after early losses. Shares remains sharply extended above a double-bottom base's 207.79 buy point. They closed Thursday 16% off their 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock threatened to give up all of Thursday's gains, falling 4.1% Friday. Early Friday, DZ Bank double-downgraded the stock from buy to sell, skipping the hold rating.</p>

Despite the recent losses, MSFT stock remains in the 20%-25% profit-taking zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors take at least some profits. And on Friday morning, Microsoft shares were off 1.5%.</p>

      <p>Tech stocks soar, sending other indexes higher, but the Dow ends the day unchanged as officials digest rate hikes</p>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.01%, or 4 points, spending most of the day in the red as investors digested the latest moves by central banks around the world.Boeing (BA) led the Dow lower while drug maker Merck (MRK) gained.</p>
    	<p>Tech stocks popped, helping lead the Nasdaq 0.8% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.25%.</p>	
      <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Dow Jones ended the day essentially unchanged, falling 0.01% while tech stocks led other indexes higher.</li>
        <li>Merck, Amgen, and Johnson & Johnson shares moved higher after an industry group sued to block new Medicare pricing laws.</li>
        <li>Boeing dropped after a worker's strike forced a key supplier to temporarily shutter a factory.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Central bank action was the focus for investors today. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Senators the Fed would likely resume hiking interest rate later this year, after pausing at its June meeting. The Bank of England surprised analysts with a higher-than-expected 50 basis point hike. And Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman echoed Powell, saying interest rates would need to go higher to fight inflation.</p>	
    	<p>Boeing shares fell 3% after workers at Spirit AeroSystems, a key supplier, voted to strike, shutting down its Kansas factory.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped 1.8% after one of its investment bankers was convicted of insider trading after a week-long trial.</p>
      <p>Merck was the Dow's best-performing stock, climbing 2.3% after a leading pharmaceutical lobby filed suit against the Biden Administration over new Medicare drug rules. The suit is similar to one filed by Merck earlier this month that seeks to block Medicare from negotiating drug prices. Amgen (AMGN) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) also rose more than 1%.</p>
      <p>Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) both gained 1.8%, while Apple (AAPL) rose 1.6% as investors snapped up Big Tech stocks.</p>
      <p>Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose 1.3% after analysts at Deutsche Bank said the company’s risk/reward profile would skew to the upside, especially following next week’s earning report.</p>

    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5 points, or less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1%.</p>	
    	<p>“The point of our meeting, last meeting, was really to moderate the pace of our decision making,” Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. Now, “the data will tell us what to do.”</p>	
    	<p>Earlier in the day, the U.S. Department of Labor said weekly jobless claims stayed flat from a week ago.</p>
      <p>“While the labor market remains strong following the better than expected May employment report, we’ve seen initial claims tick up in June,” wrote Sam Millette, fixed income strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network.</p>
      <p>“Initial claims can be quite volatile on a week-to-week basis, however the recent rise in claims is worth monitoring as it could be a signal that the labor market is starting to soften,” Millette added.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks plunged this Thursday following of the Bank of England’s decision to hike interest rates to 5% amid persistent inflation.</p>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 0.76% to close at 7,502 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.90% to 7,195 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 0.24% to 15,984.</p>	
    	<p>US stocks were mixed as a wave of hawkish central-bank hikes dampened spirits ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's second day of testimony to Congress.</p>	
    	<p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.13% to 33,907 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was muted at 4,365 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) rose 0.43% to 13,560.</p>
      <p>Back in London, the Bank’s monetary policy committee decided to raise its benchmark rate from 4.5% to 5%, an increase of half a percentage point.</p>
      <p>This is the 13th increase in UK interest rates in a row, going back to December 2021.</p>
      <p>Financial markets are now pricing in that UK interest rates will soar as high as 6% by December after inflation stuck at 8.7% in the year to May. This is up from current levels of 4.5%.</p>
      <p>The decision comes with stock markets already under pressure after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell yesterday signalled more rate hikes to come in the United States.</p>
      <p>The FTSE lost 0.76% to close at 7,502 points following the Bank of England’s decision to hike interest rates to 5% amid persistent inflation.</p>
      <p>We are now closing off our coverage of this big day for the UK economy but as investors turn their eyes across the pond, our US team will keep you updated with everything you need to know as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
      <h3>Sunak backs BoE decision as he stands by inflation pledge</h3>
      <p>Rishi Sunak has admitted his promise to halve inflation this year will now be “harder” to achieve after the Bank of England was forced to hike interest rates 50bps to 5%. </p>
      <p>Sunak said that his promise to halve inflation would be “hard” to achieve but “not impossible” and that he does not regret making that pledge.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said:</p>
      <p><strong>I absolutely don’t think it was a mistake to set as my number one priority halving inflation. I am ambitious for our country and I want to deliver on the things that are going to make the most difference to all of you and your families.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“We have got to get inflation down and at the time I set that target actually lots of people said it wasn’t ambitious enough, that it was too easy, and I knew that wasn’t true.”</strong></p>
      <p>Speaking at the Times CEO Summit, Sunak said inflation was a “global challenge” and it remained high in other countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
      <p><strong>There is, I think, a global concern about the persistence and stickiness of inflation, and the need for central banks to take strong action to take inflation down.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“The Bank of England has my support and the Government’s support to bring inflation back down to target.</strong></p>
      <h3>Wall Street opens lower</h3>
      <p>US Stocks opened lower on Thursday as investors awaited a second day of testimony on Capitol Hill from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and digested weekly jobless claims data that suggested some further softening in the US labour market.</p>
      <p>At the market open the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.26%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 55 points, or 0.16%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.21%.</p>
      <h3>More hikes on the horizon, says Janus Henderson</h3>
      <p>Following the Bank of England interest rate decision, Andrew Jones, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, said:</p>
      <p><strong>Today’s interest rate increase by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England of 0.5% to 5% was greater than most commentators had forecast. While yesterday’s higher-than-expected headline and core inflation numbers amplified the debate about the rate of further increases, most expected a more gradual 0.25% rise.</strong></p>
      <p><stropng>With inflation expected to remain high over the next few months, further rises remain highly likely. However, the MPC will be hoping that the lagged effect of the interest rate rises that started at the end of 2021 and a fall in energy prices should lead to a reduction in the inflation rate in the autumn.”</stropng></p>
      <h3>0.5% hike is 'embarrassing' for Bank of England, says Ebury</h3>
      <p>Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, said the 50bps hike was “embarrassing admission” that it had underestimated inflation. He said:</p>
      <p><strong>While the two doves somewhat bizarrely opted in favour of no change, all seven remaining MPC members unexpectedly voted for a ‘jumbo hike’. In our view, this marks yet another rather embarrassing admission that the BoE has continued to grossly underestimate the extent of the inflation overshoot, and the degree of tightening required in order to anchor inflation expectations.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“There appears to be more misery ahead for mortgage holders, as the bank maintained the line in its statement that further hikes would be required should price pressures persist. We see this as a clear signal that at least another 25bp hike is on the way in August, and expect the base rate to top out at 6%, or perhaps even higher, by the end of the year.</strong></p>
      <h3>UK headed towards recession, warns HSBC AM</h3>
      <p>The UK is headed towards a recession amid a looming ‘mortgage squeeze’ and a turn in the credit cycle, according to Joseph Little, global chief strategist at HSBC Asset Management. He said:</p>
      <p><strong>The UK finds itself in the worst position of major western economies. A cost of living crisis, brought about by rising energy and food prices, has been amplified by structural labour shortages, and has now metastasised into ratcheting wages. Inflation pressures show more persistency and more momentum than other western economies, and that forces the Bank into a hawkish corner. Today’s statement has increased concerns of a much-higher terminal policy rate, perhaps as high as 6%.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>But after the fastest rate tightening cycle since the 1980s, getting more hawkish now is not without risk. A looming ‘mortgage squeeze’ and a turn in the credit cycle means that the economy now faces a recession as we head toward 2024.</strong></p>
      <h3>Bailey: 'If we don’t raise rates now, it could be worse later'</h3>
      <p>Following the interest rate decision, governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said:</p>
      <p><strong>We’ve raised rates to 5% following recent data which showed that further action was needed to get inflation back down.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The economy is doing better than expected, but inflation is still too high and we’ve got to deal with it.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>We know this is hard - many people with mortgages or loans will be understandably worried about what this means for them. But if we don’t raise rates now, it could be worse later.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>We are committed to returning inflation to the 2% target and will make the decisions necessary to achieve that.</strong></p>
      <h3>Unions criticise rate hike</h3>
      <p>TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak has condemned today’s decision by the Bank of England to raise the base rate.</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <p><strong>This interest rate hike is the result of dangerous groupthink in the Bank of England and Downing Street. Pushing interest rates so high that the economy is driven into recession will only make the current crisis worse, costing people their jobs and their homes.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>“Inflation was caused by global energy shocks and government should be doing more to ensure households and businesses benefit as prices fall.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>"Instead of scapegoating workers who are desperate for their pay to keep up with prices, ministers should focus on a credible plan for sustainable economic growth and rising living standards."</strong></p>
      <h3>PM 'burying head in the sand' as rates rise, says Labour's Reeves</h3>
      <p>Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves accused Jeremy Hunt and Rishi Sunak of “burying their heads in the sand” about the mortgage misery facing householders. She said:</p>
      <p><strong>Families across Britain will be desperately worried about what today’s interest rate rise might mean for them.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>They want to know that support will be there if they need it.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Instead, the chancellor and prime minister are burying their heads in the sand and failing to clean up the mess this Tory government has made.</strong></p>
      <h3>Hunt backs Bank of England after latest rate hike</h3>
      <p>Responding to the interest rate rise, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:</p>
      <p><strong>High inflation is a destabilising force eating into pay cheques and slowing growth.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Core inflation is higher in 14 EU countries and interest rates are rising around the world, but the lesson from other countries is that if you stick to your guns, you bring inflation down.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Our resolve to do this is watertight because it is the only long-term way to relieve pressure on families with mortgages. If we don’t act now, it will be worse later.</strong></p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared back early losses and traded flat at noon Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell affirmed that interest rates will continue to increase in his testimony in Congress. Powell observed that "inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."</p>
    	<p>The Fed chair said in remarks prepared for his address before a House Financial Services Committee meeting that "nearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year."</p>	
    	<p>The rate pause last week was a "prudent" step, he said, to allow the committee to assess the effects of its tightening. The Fed chair will address the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.</p>	
    	<p>Last week, the Fed paused tightening and let interest rates stay unchanged while indicating that two more rate hikes may be needed to curb inflation. A hike following the July meeting would take the rate to 5.25%.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 fell 0.4% while the Nasdaq lagged, falling 1.3% at noon ET.</p>
      <p>The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.5% and Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 1.3%.</p>
      <p>Volume on the NYSE fell but rose on the Nasdaq compared with the same time on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Crude oil prices rose over 1% to trade at $72.19 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4 basis points to 3.77%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks In Focus</h3>
      <p>Apple (AAPL) continued to tread along a rising 10-day moving average, according to IBD MarketSmith. Shares pulled back slightly in light volume at the hour. Walgreens (WBA) is trying to reclaim its 50-day line ahead of earnings next week.</p>
      <p>Shares of Adobe (ADBE) rose at the opening bell but reversed lower at noon. Earlier, BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman raised his price target to 570 with an upgraded outperform rating due to a boost from AI technologies.</p>
      <p><h3>Exact Sciences (EXAS)</h3>fell despite positive results from its study to evaluate its next generation Cologuard treatment for colon cancer. The original Cologuard was approved in 2014.</p>
      <h3>Homebuilders And Medical Stocks On Watch</h3>
      <p>Outside Dow Jones, Meritage Homes (MTH) is in a buy zone after clearing a buy point of 130.68 on Tuesday. It was also Tuesday's Stock of the Day. KB Home (KBH) is on deck to report earnings Wednesday while Olive Garden restaurants parent Darden (DRI) and Accenture (ACN) report on Thursday. KBH and DRI rose while ACN is testing its 10-day line.</p>
      <p>On the IBD 50, growth stock TransMedics (TMDX) is above its 50-day line in a cup base with a buy point of 90.15. Lantheus Holdings (LNTH) retook its 50-day line on Tuesday. The medical products stock pared some gains Wednesday. Generac (GNRC), on the IBD Leaderboard, is in a cup base with a 141.54 entry.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: Tesla, Amazon</h3>
      <p>Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) fell after Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded the stock to hold from buy but raised his price target to 260 from 220.</p>
      <p><strong>Spotify (SPOT)</strong>fell as well though Wolfe Research analysts gave it a price target of 190 with an outperform rating.</p>
      <p><strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>slipped slightly after Jefferies raised its price target to 150 from 135. Shares are tracking above the 10-day line.</p>
      <p>Dow Jones stock<strong>Nike (NKE)</strong>got a price target cut to 135 from 140 from Telsey Advisory Group. Analysts maintained an outperform rating for the stock. Shares rose slightly at midday Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Oppenheimer analysts raised their price target for Uber (UBER) to 65 from 55. UBER stock pared early gains, however. It is on the IBD Leaderboard and IBD 50.</p>
      <p>Shares of FedEx (FDX) fell below the 50-day line after the shipping company gave a disappointing profit outlook for 2024. Weak demand is expected to offset a $4 billion cost-cutting effort. United Parcel Service (UPS) fell in sympathy.</p>
      <p><strong>PayPal (PYPL)</strong>fell Wednesday midday after Tuesday's significant gain as investment firm KKR agreed to buy $44 billion in loans on PayPal's balance sheet. The stock cleared its 50-day line Tuesday and is testing it Wednesday.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The market rally has shown bullish action, but be prepared for a pullback in the near term. AMD and Boeing are among stocks to watch.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures fell slightly early Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market rally showed strong, broad action last week, running past a surprisingly hawkish Federal Reserve. That raises confidence in the uptrend's longer-term prospects. But with the Nasdaq extended, the odds of a market pullback are elevated in the short term. Friday may have reflected the start of a slide, but it wasn't much of one.</p>
      <p>A pullback could create new buying opportunities in leading stocks, many of which are currently far extended from any entry. But in the short run, investors should be cautious about making new purchases, especially in hot tech areas.</p>
      <p>BA stock is trading right around a buy point. Boeing (BA) and rival Airbus (EADSY) will likely announce a bevy of new orders at the Paris Air Show, which kicked off Sunday. McKesson (MCK) broke out of a consolidation while Smith & Nephew (SNN) is above a trendline entry. Marriott International (MAR), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Floor & Decor (FND) are near buy points. All seven stocks are from nontech areas of market leadership.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Samsara (IOT) and Rambus (RMBS) are three hot stocks that are starting to pull back.</p>
    	<p>But many leaders are not retreating. Nvidia (NVDA) hit a fresh record high Friday, surging 10% for the week. Meta Platforms (META) marked a 16-month best before closing a fraction lower on Friday. Tesla (TSLA), after two tiny losses ended a record 13-day win streak, rose to a fresh eight-month high Friday.</p>
      <p>Tesla, META stock and Nvidia are on IBD Leaderboard. CMG stock is on the Leaderboard watchlist. MCK stock was added to SwingTrader on Friday, joining Boeing and FND stock. Chipotle and IOT stock are on the IBD 50. Chipotle and Tesla stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20. McKesson was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in the article reviews the market action over the past week and analyzes McKesson, Chipotle and AMD stock.</p>
      <h3>Weekend News</h3>
      <p>U.S.-China tensions appear to ease somewhat with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's trip, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top officials.</p>
      <p>The NAHB Housing Market Index rose 5 points in June to 55 vs. views for an unchanged 50. It was the sixth straight monthly gain and the first time in 11 months that builder confidence has been above the break-even 50 level. The Commerce Department will release May housing starts data at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.35% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures declined 0.25% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.25%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 3 basis points to 3.8%.</p>
      <p>China's central bank cut two more key lending rates by 10 basis points overnight, after reducing two other rates by the same amount last week. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell solidly, as investors may have wanted bigger cuts.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures fell more than 1%.</p>
      <p>U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for the Juneteenth holiday, but other exchanges around the world were open.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally had a strong week, especially on the Nasdaq, despite generally modest losses Friday.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.25% in last week's stock market trading, reaching its best levels of the year. The S&P 500 index jumped 2.6%, its best weekly gain since March. The Nasdaq composite leapt 3.25%, its eighth straight weekly advance. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.5%, well off weekly highs.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 3.77%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures rose 2.3% to $71.78 a barrel last week. Copper prices climbed 2.5%.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) advanced 2.1% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) leapt 5.2%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) ran 4.45% higher, with Nvidia and AMD stock major holdings.</p>
      <p>The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) popped 2.9% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE)  rallied 2.6%. U.S. Global Jets (JETS) ascended 5.65%. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 2.4%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) dipped 0.6%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) was up 1.4%. MCK stock is in XLV.</p>
      <p>The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) jumped 3%. BA stock is a major XLI holding.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 1.3%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell 0.9% after big gains since early May.</p>
      <p>Reflecting stocks with more speculative stories, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) rallied 4.2% last week and ARK Genomics (ARKG) leapt 3.9%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
      <h3>Stocks To Watch</h3>
      <p>BA stock rose 1.2% to 219.99 this past week, just below a 221.43 flat-base buy point. Many other industrial plays look extended from their 50-day lines, but not Boeing.</p>
      <p>MCK stock climbed 3.1% to 406.20, breaking out past a 401.53 handle buy point Friday.</p>
      <p>SNN stock jumped 6.9% to 32.16 last week, clearing a trendline in a flat base that's part of a base-on-base formation.</p>
      <p>CMG stock dipped 0.4% to 2,032.92 in low volume, trading at its 21-day line with the 10-week line catching up. Chipotle has a four-weeks-tight pattern with a 2,139.88 official buy point. That pattern could turn into a flat base in another week.</p>
      <p>MAR stock fell 1.5% to 176.36, finding support at the 21-day and 10-week lines. Marriott stock has a 183.37 buy point from a flat base next to several bases, according to MarketSmith analysis.</p>
      <p>BYD stock edged down 0.6% to 68 last week, just above its 10-week line. Boyd Gaming has a 71.69 buy point from a flat base next to two long cup-with-handle consolidations. Investors could use 70.04 as an early entry.</p>
      <p>FND stock nudged 0.3% higher to 96.26, just above the 50-day line. Floor & Decor stock has a 101.39 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, though investors could use 99.50 as aggressive entry.</p>
      <p>AMD stock fell 3.9% to 120.08 last week, reversing in heavy volume from a 52-week high of 132.83 on Tuesday. Shares are falling back toward their 21-day line and the lows of their recent mini-consolidation. AMD released new AI chips to take on Nvidia, but the market reaction wasn't great. Is AMD a potential buy if it finds support? Or do investors wait for, say, NVDA stock to take a rest?</p>
      <p>IOT stock dipped 0.3% to 28.90, pulling back reluctantly late in the week after nearly topping its late-2021 all-time high of 31.41. Shares are trading around the 10-day line, with Samara stock still well above the 21-day.</p>
      <p>RMBS stock declined 5.2% in the last week to 60.38, sliding just below the 21-day line. It's the third straight weekly decline for Rambus stock.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The market rally continues to show impressive strength. On Wednesday, the major indexes showed resilience in the face of a surprisingly hawkish Fed, then powered higher Thursday.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh 52-week bests while the Dow Jones set new 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>Even on Friday, with the Nasdaq clearly extended and the S&P 500 also getting stretched, the uptrend resisted a pullback.</p>
      <p>Market breadth was weak Friday, but has improved significantly in the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) popped 2.5% to 148.83, barely falling on Friday. It's a huge change from just a few weeks ago. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) advanced 3.2% last week.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq is now 9.1% above its 50-day line, while the Nasdaq 100 is up 10.6%. The S&P 500 is 5.5%. That all signals a market pullback is likely, with rising odds that any such retreat will be large. But stocks could continue to get even more extended for a time.</p>
      <p>Ideally, the Nasdaq would pause or give ground grudgingly in light volume, letting moving averages catch up. That would let leading stocks take a break, perhaps retreating to the 21-day or 10-week lines or even forging new bases. Of course, a pullback could be more intense, and even in a mild market retreat many individual names will suffer outsize losses.</p>
      <p>Depending on how mild or widespread the pullback is, quality stocks from outside the tech sphere could break out or at least hold up. Medical products, industrials, restaurants, travel and various housing-related plays are doing well, including Boeing, SNN, CMG, MAR and FND.</p>
      <p>Stocks rallied last week in no small part because investors simply don't believe that the Fed will raise rates two more times. Fed chief Jerome Powell could take a more hawkish tone before Congress this week after his relatively dovish comments last Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>With the Nasdaq and so many chip, software and AI leaders extended, it's not a good time to be buying techs. Investors could look to add exposure elsewhere. Still, a Nasdaq-led pullback could hit everyone. Investors also may want to save their powder for post-pullback buying opportunities in big tech winners.</p>
      <p>You can consider taking partial profits in big winners, either on the way up or as they cross below their 10-day lines. That will depend on the size of your individual positions and overall exposure, your conviction in various holdings and your own investing style. But have an exit strategy in place.</p>
      <p>When a market pause or pullback takes hold, you'll want to keep a close eye on stocks finding key support or consolidating around buy points. So run your screens this long weekend to keep track of the wide array of leaders and potential leaders.</p>
      <p>The market rally has been impressive. Despite some near-term caution, the overall trend is bullish. Act accordingly.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>European stocks and the FTSE 100 finished lower on Monday afternoon as the pound hit a 10-month high versus the euro (GBPEUR=X) with investors anticipating the performance of the currency ahead of UK inflation data and a Bank of England decision on interest rates this week.</p>
	    <p>At the close, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 0.71% to 7,588.48 points. The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris declined 1.11% to 7,306.35 points, while in Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) also fell, by 0.99% to 16,195.25 points.</p>
      <h3>FTSE 100 stocks</h3>	
      <p>Rolls Royce Holdings (RR.L) and Entain (ENT.L) were top of the FTSE 100 basket while Ocado Group (OCDO.L) and Spirax-Sarco Engineering (SPX) were at the bottom of the index.</p>
      <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: "Following a weaker session overnight in Asia, European markets have followed suit, opening in the red as last week’s bullishness appears to be fading at least for now. Rolls-Royce has opened at the top of the FTSE 100 after it announced plans to begin testing a new small gas turbine specifically developed to power hybrid-electric flight.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia markets</h3>
	    <p>It is a quieter than normal session for global stocks with US markets closed today due to a federal holiday.</p>	
	    <p>On Friday, the main US indexes closed in the red after Federal Reserve officials dampened optimism that the US central bank is nearing the end of its interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) fell 0.32% to 34,299.12 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.37% to 4,409.59 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) also closed lower, by 0.68% to 13,689.57.</p>
      <p>In Asia, the markets were mixed overnight. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) fell 1.00% to 33,370.42 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong lost 1.16% to 19,807.50. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also declined, by 0.49% to 3,257.25 points.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 closed at 7,588.48 this Monday, down 0.7%, as investors fear interest rates could rise as high as 6%.</p>
      <p>Michael Hewson chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “It’s been a weak and subdued session for markets in Europe, with today’s losses predominantly on the back of the late Friday sell-off in the US which saw markets there close off their highs of the week”.</p>
      <p>He noted: “Mining stocks are weaker on the back of disappointment that Chinese authorities haven’t weighed in on any new stimulus measures yet, with the likes of Rio Tinto and Glencore slightly lower.</p>

      <h3>FTSE 100 and European stocks</h3>
      <p>Just before markets closed in the UK and Europe, the The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was down 0.78% to 7,583.19 points. The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris declined 1.16% to 7,303.30 points, while in Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) also fell, by 1.00% to 16,195.58 points as investors look ahead now to UK inflation data on Wednesday and a decision on interest rates from the BoE on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>FTSE 100 top risers and fallers</h3>
      <p>As of 16:00 BST, the top risers on the FTSE 100 index included Next (NXT.L) and Frasers Group (FRAS.L).</p>
      <p>Next stock was up nearly 5% after the company raised its sales and profit guidance for the year on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Frasers Group stock was up nearly 3% in afternoon trade as the retailer continued its stake-building in ASOS.</p>
      <p>Spirax-Sarco Engineering (SPX.L) and Ocado (OCDO.L) were at the bottom of the index. Ocado shares fell after reports that a robotics start-up backed by the online retailer was on the brink of collapse.</p>
      <h3>US markets closed</h3>
      <p>A reminder, US markets are closed today due to the Juneteenth federal holiday.</p>
      <h3>M&S (MKS.L) cuts food prices</h3>
      <p>Following Morrison's announcement to cut food prices, food retailer Marks & Spencer is set to do the same, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>It said M&S has cut the price of 70 staple products, such as beef mince, Greek-style yoghurt, salmon fillets, chickpeas and tortilla wraps, by between 3% and 25%.</p>
      <p>The group is also locking the prices of 150 products until the autumn, including pork sausages, Cheddar cheese and coleslaw.</p>
      <p>The move provides further optimism that rampant food inflation may be on the decline.</p>
      <h3>British American Tobacco (BATS.L) shake-up</h3>
      <p>The new boss of British American Tobacco has created a host of new board positions, including chief operating officer, chief strategy & growth officer, and director of business development.</p>
      <p>Tadeu Marroco, who joined in mid-May, is aiming to "sharpen the focus on improved execution and operational excellence".</p>
      <p>Shares in the company edged slightly lower in afternoon trade.</p>
      <h3>Next (NXT.L) shares up nearly 5%</h3>
      <p>The British retailer's shares were up nearly 5%, as of 14:43 BST, after the company raised its sales and profit guidance for the year on Monday.</p>
      <p>Next put the positive outlook down to trading exceeding expectations on the back of warmer weather - and consumers getting a wage boost in April.</p>
      <p>The company said full price sales in the first seven weeks of its fiscal second quarter were up 9.3% versus the previous year, above expectations - and also highlighted that it beat its full price sales estimates by £93m in the period.</p>
      <h3>UK mortgage crisis: Key updates</h3>
      <p>What's happening? The average two-year fixed mortgage deal now has an interest rate of more than 6% for the first time this year, Ross McGuinness summarises for Yahoo Finance.</p>
      <p>And it could get worse with the Bank of England widely expected to raise its base rate, currently at 4.5%, to 4.75% on Thursday. It would be the 13th time in a row it has increased.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the Resolution Foundation think tank predicted that annual mortgage payments will rise by nearly £3,000 for the average household remortgaging next year.</p>
      <p>However, today, prime minister Rishi Sunak appeared to rule out further aid for mortgage holders as the interest rates crisis deepens.</p>
      <p>Samuel Mather-Holgate, an independent financial adviser at Mather and Murray Financial said: “The quickest, easiest and most sensible thing the Government can do is to stop the Bank of England raising interest rates.”</p>
      <h3>Pound hits 10-month high</h3>
      <p>In afternoon trade in the UK, the pound sterling hit a 10-month high against the euro (GBPEUR=X) ahead of inflation data on Wednesday and a Bank of England decision on interest rates on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Against sterling, the euro fell to 85.20 pence, the lowest since August 2022. It was last down less than 0.1% at 85.25 pence.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the pound was down 0.13% against the dollar (GBPUSD=X) at $1.281.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs said that, according to its trade-weighted measure of sterling, the pound is at its highest since mid-2016, just after the Brexit referendum, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>"Potentially there is more room to go," Pushkar Jha, head of UK inflation trading at Goldman, said in a note to clients.</p>
      <p>"If the market continues to believe that the central bank will deliver on its mandate of achieving 2% CPI (consumer price index inflation) by its forecast horizon, then there is no reason why GBP can't continue being supported."</p>
      <p>It comes as Bank of America and Barclays have both backed sterling to keep rising against the dollar, for now.</p>
      <h3>China's growth outlook</h3>
      <p>Goldman Sachs is the latest bank to downgrade its growth forecast for China as the world's second largest economy struggles to pick up the pace since reopening from its Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
      <p>The Wall Street bank cut its full-year gross domestic product forecast for this year from 6% to 5.4%.</p>
      <p>“With continued challenges from the property market, pervasive pessimism among consumers and private entrepreneurs, and only moderate policy easing to partially offset the strong growth headwinds, we mark down our 2023 real GDP forecast,” economists led by Chief China Economist Hui Shan said in research note, according to CNBC.</p>
      <p>UBS, Bank of America and JPMorgan have also downgraded their China full-year GDP estimates.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Any investors who are searching for Mutual Fund Equity Report funds should take a look at USAA NASDAQ-100 Index Fund (USNQX). While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, we were able to examine other factors like performance, volatility, and cost.</p>
    	<h3>History of Fund/Manager</h3>
      <p>Victory is based in Columbus, OH, and is the manager of USNQX. Since USAA NASDAQ-100 Index Fund made its debut in October of 2000, USNQX has garnered more than $3.80 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Mannik Dhillon who has been in charge of the fund since July of 2019.</p>
      <h3>Performance</h3>	
    	<p>Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 15.94%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 14.66%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.</p>
      <p>When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences.</p>
      <p>USNQX's standard deviation over the past three years is 23.45% compared to the category average of 20.57%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 22.28% compared to the category average of 18.14%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.</p>
      <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
      <p>Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.11, so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well.</p>
      <p>The fund has produced a positive alpha over the past 5 years of 4.09, which shows that managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.</p>
      <h3>Expenses</h3>
      <p>Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors.</p>
      <p>In terms of fees, USNQX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.44% compared to the category average of 0.79%. So, USNQX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.</p>
      <p>While the minimum initial investment for the product is $3,000, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $50.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
    	<p>Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here. You can check out all the great mutual fund tools we have to offer by going to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds to see the additional features we offer as well for additional information.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is betting that a new program allowing investors to trade equities in the yuan on top of its local currency will help revive its flagging stock market and boost turnover that’s hovering at a four-year low.</p>
      <p>The stock exchange is rolling out the so-called HKD-RMB Dual Counter Model on Monday to give traders the option to buy and sell some of the financial hub’s biggest-listed stocks using the yuan, including Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and China Mobile Ltd. There are 24 companies on the list with a combined market value equivalent to $1.9 trillion, or more than a third of the city’s total.</p>
      <p>The initiative holds a lot of promise: it can draw more buyers by minimizing exchange-rate risk and solidify the yuan’s growing status as an international currency. The influx of capital may also provide the next catalyst for Hong Kong shares, helping extend a rally this month thanks to hopes of new stimulus measures.</p>
    	<p>“As investors, we don’t like our portfolios to be exposed to foreign-exchange risks,” said Ding Wenjie, investment strategist at China Asset Management Co., one of the nation’s largest fund houses. “Chinese investors will have the incentive to buy yuan-denominated shares in Hong Kong to get rid of that. To some extent, it will attract more investors and will boost turnover in the Hong Kong market.”</p>	
    	<p>The scheme will only be available to offshore funds during the initial phase, and authorities plan to extend it to mainland investors through the southbound trading link at a later stage.</p>	
    	<p>If successful, the dual counter will unleash a new wave of mainland cash onto Hong Kong shares. Onshore investors have a growing presence in the city’s stock market, with their turnover on the trading links accounting for more than 26% of Hong Kong’s daily total, data compiled by Bloomberg show.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the most actively traded stocks on the yuan counter by turnover included China Mobile, BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. and Tencent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Trading in China Mobile accounted for about 13% of the stock’s overall volume.</p>
      <p>“The move reflects China’s efforts to continue to broaden and deepen its capital markets, as part of capital market reform,” said Elizabeth Kwik, investment director of Asian equities at abrdn. “While we think it is likely to boost Hong Kong market liquidity, market sentiment is a different thing altogether and most likely still captive to macro and policy concerns.”</p>
      <p>Some investors hope the counter will help to revive the longer term prospects of the benchmark Hang Seng Index, which despite its recent rally is still trailing most stock gauges worldwide this quarter. Investors have retreated from Hong Kong equities as Chinese economic growth lost momentum and geopolitical risks damped sentiment.</p>
      <p>The city’s average daily stock turnover has fallen to HK$116 billion so far this year, the lowest since 2019.</p>
      <p>The dual counter’s launch comes as Beijing is stepping up efforts to shore up growth. Authorities are said to be considering a broad package of stimulus measures after lowering a short-term policy interest rate last week. China must adopt “more forceful” measures to support the economic recovery, state television reported Friday, citing a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Qiang.</p>
      <h3>Weak Reception</h3>
      <p>But, there’s reason to be cautious given the city’s experiment with a similar model in 2012 failed to take off. Back then, the “dual tranche, dual counter” system was introduced to give an issuer the option to offer and list shares in both the Hong Kong dollar and the yuan. Only one company adopted the scheme: Shenzhen Investment Holdings Bay Area Development Co.</p>
      <p>“Progress was not satisfactory due to inactive cross-border transactions and a not-fully-developed market mechanism at that time,” HSBC Holdings Plc analysts including Raymond Liu wrote in a June 7 report, referring to the old model. “Turnover was lackluster and the performance of the RMB counter was poor.”</p>
      <p>Hong Kong Studies Boosting Yuan-Denominated Stocks on Bourse (2)</p>
      <p>Some investors say the initiative may fare better this time, helping fuel a recovery in the broader market.</p>
      <p>“As it becomes more convenient to invest in Hong Kong stocks, more Chinese capital are expected to join the market to improve both the turnover and volatility,” said Xiancheng Zhao, portfolio manager at Bosera Asset Management Co. “That’s going to help the valuation recovery and narrow the gap between shares trading in China and the city.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- A seemingly unstoppable stock rally fueled by Wall Street’s obsession over anything related to artificial intelligence faltered on Friday, with the market facing the test of a massive options expiration.</p>
    	<p>Traders also took some chips off the table ahead of Monday’s US holiday. The Nasdaq 100 underperformed, led by losses in giants like Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. — which had recently closed at all-time highs.</p>	
    	<p>A worrisome warning from Micron Technology Inc. weighed on chipmakers, while Adobe Inc. climbed on a bullish forecast. The S&P 500 halted a six-day winning streak, but still notched its best week since March.</p>	
    	<p>Stock traders caught between the fear of missing out on this year’s rally and mounting concerns about an overbought market had something else to cope with this week: positioning.</p>
      <p>With an estimated $4.2 trillion in options contracts tied to stocks and indexes scheduled to mature, traders would typically need to either roll over existing positions or start new ones. The impact of derivatives on trading this week was so significant that, at one point, the market’s favorite volatility gauge was climbing alongside the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>The so-called VIX finally gave in, and with Friday’s plunge, it ended up erasing this week’s advance.</p>
      <p>“The market could see some wild swings in either direction for no fundamental (or even technical) reason at all,” on a day like today, wrote Matt Maley, chief market strategist Miller Tabak + Co. “So nobody should read anything into today’s movement.”</p>
      <h3>Inflation, Putin, Fed</h3>
      <p>Indeed, the market seemed to have ignored to a certain extent some developments that would otherwise be considered catalysts for trading.</p>
      <p>That was the case with data showing a slump in consumer year-ahead inflation expectations and the latest geopolitical news. President Vladimir Putin said Russia has delivered its first tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, three months after announcing the plan that threatens to ratchet up tensions with the US and its allies over the war in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Not even hawkish Fedspeak had much of an impact or any impact at all on trading.</p>
      <p>“The market caught a renewed bid from traders suffering from FOMO and ‘chasing’ the market higher,” said Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded The Sevens Report newsletter. “We are not bearish stocks right now, but we are growing cautious on the very near-term direction of the market given how quickly the market priced in a very Goldilocks macroeconomic environment based on only limited evidence of improvement in the current major market influences.”</p>
      <p>The rally in US stocks is about to run out of steam, according to Citigroup Inc.</p>
      <p>Strategists at the bank led by Scott Chronert this week reiterated their call for the S&P 500 to drop to 4,000 by year-end, and initiated a new target of 4,400 by mid-2024, or just below Friday’s 4,410 close.</p>
      <p>Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett said Friday he’s not convinced this is the start of a “brand, new shiny bull market.” The current market looks more like 2000 or 2008, with a “big rally before big collapse,” Hartnett wrote.</p>
      <p>Equities had about $22 billion inflows in the week through June 14, while bonds had $6.7 billion of additions, BofA said in a note, citing EPFR Global data.</p>
      <p>In other corporate news, iRobot Corp. soared after Amazon.com Inc.’s proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy the robot vacuum firm was given the all-clear by the UK’s antitrust agency.</p>
      <p>Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., Richard Branson’s space-tourism venture, surged after announcing that its long-awaited first commercial passenger mission will take off as soon as June 27.</p>

    	<p>Investors couldn’t keep up the momentum from this week’s Fed rates news, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still moved higher for the third-straight week</p>
      <p>Investors weren’t able to keep up the excitement over Federal interest rates and more positive economic data today, but it wasn't enough to derail a positive week for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).</p>
      <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Dow fell about 0.2% to finish a week where the Index moved higher by 1.3%.</li>
        <li>Apple reaches an intraday all-time high before falling back 0.6%.</li>

        <li>Disney falls lower after a top executive leaves amid rumbles about the company’s restructuring.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>The Dow gained about 1.3% over the week, the third straight the index has moved higher. Lower by 0.5% today, the Nasdaq finished the week higher by 2.8%, while the S&P 500’s 0.3% drop today didn’t stop it from gaining 2.4% on the week.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>US stocks lost steam on Friday as a recent rally took a pause amid signs of a resilient economy that boosted hopes the Federal Reserve could end its rate-hike campaign soon.</p>
    	<p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished down about 0.3% on Friday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.7%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq still finished the week with their best gains since March.</p>	
    	<p>In economic data, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed consumers are slightly more confident about the state of the economy, which could help tilt a "hawkish" Fed closer to a July rate hike.</p>	
    	<p>The June preliminary number came in at 63.9, compared to expectations of 60.5, according to estimates from Bloomberg. The index had dipped to 59.2 last month in its first fall since February.</p>
      <p>Global stocks got a lift from growing expectations that China will have to bump up stimulus as its recovery stutters.</p>
      <h3>Stocks close lower to end busy trading week</h3>
      <p>US stocks ended Friday's trading session lower after the three major indices saw fresh year-to-date highs the previous day following Wednesday's "hawkish hold" from the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) snapped a 6-day winning streak to close down 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, but still notched their best weeks since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped more than 105 points, or 0.3%.</p>
      <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury (^TNX) rose 4 basis points to trade at roughly 3.77%. Crude oil (CL=F) climbed about 1.5% to settle at around $71.69 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Another busy week of earnings, econ data ahead</h3>
      <p>Via Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez, here's a look at what to expect on the earnings docket and economic calendar in the week ahead.</p>
      <h3>Spotify parts ways with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</h3>
      <p>Spotify (SPOT) won't be renewing its podcast deal with the production company founded by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Archewell Audio. The news comes less than a year after the debut of Markle's first podcast, "Archetypes."</p>
      <p>"Spotify and Archewell Audio have mutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series we made together," Spotify and Archewell Audio announced in a joint statement on Thursday. No reason was given for the split.</p>
      <p>Spotify shares were up more than 3% on Friday following the news. The stock is up more than 85% year-to-date.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the audio giant announced it'd be eliminating 200 jobs, or 2% of its workforce, within its podcast division, citing "a strategic realignment."</p>
      <p>Spotify cut 6% of its workforce, or about 600 employees, earlier this year. At that time, Spotify also announced a business restructuring that led to the departure of chief content officer and advertising business officer, Dawn Ostroff.</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq set for 8th-straight winning week, typically a bullish signal</h3>
      <p>The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is set to extend its winning streak to 8 straight weeks, which is somewhat rare.</p>
      <p>This has occurred only four times this century and 23 times since the Nasdaq's inception five decades ago.</p>
      <p>Looking at subsequent returns, the pattern is increasingly bullish as the length of time is increased. One week later, 57% of the returns are positive. This increases to 87% a year later, with an average gain of 16%.</p>
      <p>One standout to the downside is the April 2010 streak, which was followed two weeks later by the original Flash Crash on May 6, 2010, which saw the Dow fall 1,000 points intraday. At the time, QE1 had completed, and the Treasury was busy refilling its Supplementary Financing Program account at the Federal Reserve back up to $200 billion.</p>
      <p>There's a modern parallel, as the Treasury is now about to refill its Treasury General Account (TGA) at the Fed to the tune of $1 trillion (potentially, though there's no explicit target).</p>
      <p>The 1981 bull streak reversed ahead of a 14-month bear market, egged on at the time by Fed Chair Paul Volcker's battle against inflation.</p>
      <p>In 1999, the Nasdaq's rally break spelled trouble for investors over the long term.</p>
      <p>But as history shows, extended rallies in the market typically lead to further gains in the months ahead.</p>
      <h3>Michael Jordan's meme sale</h3>
      <p>Michael Jordan has agreed to sell his majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets to a group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, the league announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>Jordan will retain a minority ownership share as part of the deal, which is reportedly valued at about $3 billion, according to ESPN.</p>
      <p>Plotkin, who acquired a minority stake in the Hornets in 2019, founded hedge fund Melvin Capital, which lost billions in the meme stock fiasco of 2021 after the investor bet against meme darling GameStop (GME). The firm shut down last year after having taken heavy losses.</p>
      <p>Melvin Capital lost 39% in 2021 and another 23% in the first quarter of last year, Reuters reported in April 2022.</p>
      <h3>Fed officials 'comfortable doing more'</h3>
      <p>Richmond Federal Reserve President Tom Barkin said Friday if inflation doesn’t fall closer to the Fed's target of 2%, he’s comfortable raising interest rates higher, as reported by Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger.</p>
      <p>"I am still looking to be convinced of the plausible story that slowing demand returns inflation relatively quickly to that target," Barkin said while speaking at the Maryland Government Finance Officer Association. "If coming data doesn’t support that story, I’m comfortable doing more."</p>
      <p>In the week ahead, Fedspeak will be a big part of the conversation for investors with Fed Chair Jay Powell set to testify before lawmakers Wednesday and Thursday as part of his semi-annual testimony before the House and Senate.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Powell's testimony, the Fed released its semi-annual monetary policy report, which reiterated the central bank is "strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective."</p>
      <p>Still, that might take some time, according to updated economic forecasts in the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP.) The SEP indicated the Federal Reserve sees core inflation peaking at 3.9% this year — higher than March's projection of 3.6% — before cooling to 2.6% next year and 2.2% in 2025.</p>
      <p>Additionally, latest Fed "dot plot," which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future, suggests rates will continue to tick higher in 2023.</p>
      <p>Fed officials now see the fed funds rate peaking at 5.6% this year, higher than the Fed's previous March projection of 5.1%.This suggests the Fed will likely raise rates by 0.25% two more times this year.</p>
      <h3>Stocks lose steam</h3>
      <p>Stocks lost some steam in late morning trading on Friday.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded near the flatline, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into the red.</p>
      <p>The moves came after The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed consumers are slightly more confident about the state of the economy, which could help tilt a "hawkish" Fed closer to a July rate hike.</p>
      <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury (^TNX) rose 3 basis points to trade at roughly 3.76%.</p>
      <h3>Disney CFO exit 'yet another wrinkle' to Bob Iger's restructuring</h3>
      <p>In another surprise executive shakeup, Disney (DIS) announced Thursday its CFO Christine McCarthy will step down from her longstanding role due to a family medical leave of absence.</p>
      <p>McCarthy, a close confidant of Iger who had served as Disney's financial chief for eight years, will be replaced by Kevin Lansberry, executive vice president and CFO of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, effective July 1.</p>
      <p>Lansberry will serve as interim CFO until a full-time replacement is found. McCarthy will stay on the leadership team as a strategic advisor and will assist with the process of identifying and onboarding a long-term successor "to ensure a smooth and successful transition," Disney said.</p>
      <p>Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall said Lansberry will face a slew of uphill battles heading into the back half of 2023, including a softening of parks growth due to inflation, a murky timeline for direct-to-consumer (DTC) margin improvements — the biggest issue, in Cahall's view — in addition to the purchase of Hulu's minority stake and the impact of taking ESPN fully over-the-top.</p>
      <p>"Separately these are speed bumps to the stock. Together they're obstacles," he wrote in a new note to clients on Friday.</p>
      <p>Disney shares were down about 1% on Friday following the news.</p>
      <h3>US consumer confidence ticks up</h3>
      <p>The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed consumers are feeling a bit better about the state of the economy, a data point that could help tilt a "hawkish" Fed closer to a July rate hike.</p>
      <p>The June preliminary number came in at 63.9, compared to expectations of 60.5, according to estimates from Bloomberg. The index had dipped to 59.2 last month in its first dip since February.</p>
      <p>Also, the survey found consumers' expectations of inflation in the year ahead fell significantly. Survey respondents expect inflation at 3.3% by this time next year, compared to a 4.2% reading last month. That is the lowest reading since March 2021.</p>
      <h3>Stocks open higher</h3>
      <p>Stocks opened higher on Friday as markets look to close out another week of gains following the the Federal Reserve's 'hawkish' pause on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC), Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were each up about 0.3% shortly after the opening bell.</p>
      <p>The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is due out at 10 a.m. ET, offering the final piece of economic data for the week. Economists expect the June preliminary number to come in at 60.5, compared to 59.2 last month, according to estimates from Bloomberg.</p>
      <h3>The most enthusiastic market rally in 19 years</h3>
      <p>In case you haven't heard — the stock market has been going up.</p>
      <p>After entering a new bull market last week, stock bulls continue to remain in control with the major averages again poised for weekly gains.</p>
      <p>And though the initial knock on this bull run is that it was only a few stocks doing the leading, Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre noted in Friday's Morning Brief that the other 493 members of the S&P 500 are now getting in on the action.</p>
      <p>Amid this broadening of the market rally, the S&P 500 has also become overextended, at least compared to market history.</p>
      <p>Here's Bespoke Investment Group on the superlative: "For the last ten trading days now, the S&P 500 has closed more than two standard deviations above its 50-day moving average (what we call short-term 'extreme' overbought levels), and yesterday almost closed three standard deviations above its 50-DMA (+2.97). That was its most overbought close since November 2004 which was right after George W Bush won re-election over John Kerry."</p>
      <p>In plain English, think of the 50-day moving average as the best indicator of the market's short-term direction. How much the market trades above or below that level, then, can be thought of as a proxy for whether investors are more or less excited about the market's prevailing trend than the 50-day suggests.</p>
      <p>Bespoke also notes that the current streak of 10 days in "extreme overbought" territory hasn't exactly been common over the last 70-odd years of market history, with just 35 such streaks having occurred since 1952. This is also the first time we've seen the index at "extreme overbought" levels since April 2021.</p>
      <p>The longest streak on record? 17 trading days back in December 1995.</p>
      <h3>Virgin Galactic rises 40% on commercial flight announcement</h3>
      <p>Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) were... taking off... lifting off... reaching terminal velocity, etc. after the company announced late Thursday plans to begin commercial space operations later this month.</p>
      <p>In a release, the company said — "The first commercial spaceflight, 'Galactic 01,' is planned to fly between June 27 – June 30, 2023. The second commercial spaceflight, 'Galactic 02,' will follow in early August 2023, with monthly spaceflights expected thereafter."</p>
      <p>Virgin Galactic stock was up as much as 42% in pre-market trade on Friday.</p>
      <p>Over the last year, shares of the company are down about 30% as investors shied away from more speculative plays amid the Fed's rate hikes. Since its peak in early June 2021, the stock is off more than 80%.</p>
      <h3>Global stocks rise to highest levels in 14 months</h3>
      <p>The upbeat mood was playing out in global equities on Friday, amid hopes for more Chinese stimulus and for an end to Fed rate hikes.</p>
      <p>The MSCI All-World index advanced about 0.2% on Friday, to its highest level since mid-April 2022.</p>
      <p>The gains came as Japan's Nikkei 225 rose for the 10th week in a row, to log its longest win streak since February 2013. On Friday, the Bank of Japan decided to leave its negative interest rate unchanged.</p>
      <h3>Stock futures flat as upbeat mood fades</h3>
      <p>US stock futures lost hold of earlier gains to trade around the flatline Friday, as investors looked to economic data for cues to when and whether the Fed will hike rates again.</p>
      <p>Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) were down 15 points, less than 0.1%, while those on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) showed a similar loss. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) we up just less than 0.1%.</p>
      <p>The major benchmarks rallied Thursday, after data showed retail sales in May were stronger than expected in the US.</p>
      <p>The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment report is due later Friday, and will be watched for clues to the economic outlook.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Year-to-date, the S&P 500 has delivered an impressive return of 14%. However, those gains are a bit deceiving as the bulk of the upside has been driven by only a few selected stocks, namely the tech Mega Caps (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMZN). If we exclude those five stocks, the index has only advanced by 5%.</p>
    	<p>While one could argue that the market is due for a cooling down period after such a rally, Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin suggests otherwise, citing past evidence. “Prior episodes of sharply narrowing breadth have been followed by a ‘catch-up’ from a broader valuation re-rating,” Kostin explained.</p>	
    	<p>As such, Kostin not only increased Goldman’s year-end price target for the S&P 500 from 4000 to 4500 (a 12.5% lift), but there’s also the prospect of stocks yet to reap the benefits of the rally closing the gap as the year progresses.</p>	
    	<p>Against this backdrop, Goldman Sachs analysts have been seeking out those equities and have turned their focus to two that have plenty of upside, according to their calculations – in the order of 90%, or more.</p>
      <p>Running the tickers through the TipRanks database, it’s clear Goldman is not alone in thinking these stocks have plenty to offer investors; both are also rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus.</p>
      <h3>Rent the Runway (RENT)</h3>
      <p>Our first Goldman-backed stock is a disruptor in the fashion industry. Rent the Runway lives up to its moniker by accurately describing its activities, which involve offering clients the opportunity to rent high-end fashion items. This concept of temporary ownership allows customers to browse a diverse range of styles, sizes, and brands on the Rent the Runway website or mobile app.</p>
      <p>They can then choose items to rent for specific occasions or timeframes. The platform provides options for both one-time rentals and subscription plans. In line with the trends of 2023, the company utilizes AI algorithms and machine learning techniques to enhance various aspects of its business, including inventory management and personalization.</p>
      <p>It’s a formula that helped the company deliver a strong set of results in its most recent readout – for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 (April quarter). Revenue rose by 10.6% year-over-year to $74.2 million, beating the Street’s expectations by $0.99 million. Likewise, EPS of -$0.46 came in better than the -$0.49 the prognosticators were looking for.</p>
      <p>That said, concerns about the outlook blotted the performance. The company sees FQ2 revenue hitting the range between $77 million to $79 million. Consensus was looking for 81 million.</p>
      <p>Shares pulled back consequently and have generally lagged the market this year – declining by 24% so far. For Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, however, the present valuation represents an opportunity for investors.</p>
      <p>“In our view, RENT shares (at current levels) are not pricing-in the multi-year scenario of 25% topline growth and scaling margins that mgmt. outlined last quarter,” said the 5-star analyst. “Longer term, we still see RENT as the leader in the subscription-based effort to drive the adoption of the sharing economy theme in the apparel sector.</p>
      <p>In particular, we would flag RENT mgmt’s comments on AI as a potential positive for their platform and a broader disruptive force for the industry which warrants further attention in coming quarters.”</p>
      <p>These comments underpin Sheridan’s Buy rating on RENT, while his $6 price target suggests the stock will run up by a bountiful 150% over the coming year.</p>
      <p>Sheridan’s upbeat thesis gets support on the Street. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 6 Buys vs. 1 Hold. Additionally, the $4.93 average target leaves room for one-year gains of 105%. (See RENT stock forecast)</p>
      <h3>Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR)</h3>
      <p>For our next Goldman-backed name we’ll switch gears and head to the biotech space. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is at the forefront of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, developing innovative medicines that target and silence specific disease-causing genes.</p>
      <p>The company’s cutting-edge technology, known as the Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM) platform, enables the precise delivery of RNAi drugs to specific tissues and organs, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of various diseases.</p>
      <p>The company has a lengthy and diverse clinical pipeline and some eye-catching industry collaborations including Takeda, Amgen, and Horizon Therapeutics. Looking forward, Arrowhead expects to have 18 drug candidates in clinical studies by the end of 2023, ​addressing a broad range of cell types, such as liver, solid tumor, pulmonary, CNS, and skeletal muscle. It also already has candidates in Phase 3 studies.</p>
      <p>Further back in development, but making some promising progress, the company is also developing ARO-RAGE, currently in a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of patients with asthma. This drug has been showing some positive results.</p>
      <p>At Arrowhead’s recent R&D Day, the firm presented data that showed that a single inhaled dose of 184 mg knocked down the RAGE protein – which is correlated with lung diseases such as asthma – by an average of 90% and up to a maximum of 95%.</p>
      <p>This drug’s potential has caught the eye of Goldman Sachs analyst Madhu Kumar, who lays down the bullish thesis for the therapy.</p>
      <p>“There is significant market potential for ARO-RAGE in the broader asthma therapeutic landscape,” said the 5-star analyst. “Specifically, we estimate the biologics market for eosinophilic asthma to reach over $4B in 2023 and grow to about $7B over the next five years. This estimate takes into account sales estimates for Tezspire from AMGN and JNJ, Nucala from GSK, Fasenra from AZN, and Dupixent from REGN and SNY.”</p>
      <p>“While many of these biologics share the same dosing regimen as ARO-RAGE of once every four weeks (although ARO-RAGE could potentially be dosed less frequently), we see potential for differentiation with respect to efficacy, including rate of exacerbation, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO),” Kumar went on to add.</p>
      <p>How does this all translate to investors? Kumar rates the shares as Buy, backed by a $68 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be pocketing returns of 92% a year from now.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the Street, ARWR receives an additional 8 Buys and 3 Holds, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $61.45 average target, the shares will climb ~74% higher over the 12-month timeframe. (See ARWR stock forecast)</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are at 2023 highs with breadth expanding heading into the Fed decision. Here's what investors need. now.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures fell slightly early Wednesday, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were modestly higher. The Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision Wednesday afternoon, with markets expecting a "hawkish pause."</p>	
    	<p>The stock market rally continued as CPI inflation data reinforced bets that the Fed will take no action on Wednesday. Meanwhile, hopes for China stimulus also buoyed commodities, industrials and many Chinese stocks.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla (TSLA) continued its record-breaking run. Nvidia (NVDA) cleared a buy point for existing investors, though it was an aggressive entry.</p>
      <p>The major indexes rose modestly with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 at 52-week highs and the Dow Jones moving to a four-month high. Small and midcap stocks led amid strong market breadth. But the Nasdaq is getting close to being extended — and so are many leaders.</p>
      <p>Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) made a bullish move while Cloudflare (NET) rebounded back above a buy point. Unity Software (U) topped an early entry in its handle. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is flashing an early entry. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) gapped above its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Still, investors should be cautious about adding exposure, especially in tech stocks, in the current environment.</p>
      <p>Tesla and Nvidia stock are on IBD Leaderboard. NET stock is on the IBD 50. TSLA stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article highlighted the market action and analyzed LSCC stock, Vertex and Freeport-McMoRan.</p>
      <p>In other news, UnitedHealth (UNH) said seniors are finally catching up on non-emergency surgeries that had been subdued since the pandemic. UNH stock fell nearly 6% on expectations for significantly higher medical costs. That also hit other managed-care firms such as Humana (HUM). But it's good news for hospitals and perhaps some medical product firms.</p>
      <p>The European Union said Google has abused its ad-tech dominance and may seek to force the Alphabet (GOOGL)unit to sell part of that business. Google stock edged lower.</p>
      <h3>Fed Meeting Decision</h3>
      <p>The Consumer Price Index inflation rate fell to a two-year low of 4% in May, slightly cooler than expected. Core CPI dipped to a still-high 5.3%, in line with estimates.</p>
      <p>With no negative surprises, the CPI inflation report essentially locked in expectations that the Fed will leave its target rate at 5%-5.25%. The key will be the Fed rate-hike outlook, including from Fed chief Jerome Powell. Markets are pricing in a 65% chance of a Fed rate hike in late July.</p>
      <p>The Fed meeting announcement is at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, with Fed chief Powell due at 2:30 p.m.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.2% vs. fair value, with UNH stock pushing blue chips into the red. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 3.81%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures rose slightly.</p>
      <p>At 8:30 a.m. ET, the Labor Department will release the May producer price index.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <p>Stock Market Rally</p>
      <p>The stock market rally showed a broad advance on Tuesday, shrugging off the upside reversal in Treasury yields.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 3.84% after initially falling to 3.68%. That's the highest since May 26 and the strongest close in three months.</p>
      <p>The U.S. tame inflation report eased concerns heading into the Fed meeting decision. Meanwhile, China's central bank trimmed a short-term rate with optimism growing that Beijing will adopt new fiscal stimulus amid disappointing economic data.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% in Tuesday's stock market trading, to the highest point in four months. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.7% and the Nasdaq composite advanced 0.8%, both at fresh 52-week highs. The small-cap Russell 200 jumped 1.2%, a three-month best.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices jumped 3.4% to $69.42 a barrel. Copper futures popped 2.1%. Commodities rallied on China stimulus talk and a weaker dollar.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) climbed 1.4% to a six-month high. The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) popped 1.6%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rose 0.7%, with Unity stock an IGV holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gained 1.4%, with NVDA stock the No. 1 component.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) rallied 2.3% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) jumped 3.3%. Tesla stock is the biggest holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Cathie Wood trimmed her TSLA stock stake on Monday.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) bounced 2.75%, with FCX stock a notable component. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) climbed 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 2.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 1.3%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) edged up 0.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) nudged 0.5% higher, with VRTX stock a holding. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gained 1.15%, setting a 52-week high.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 0.6%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rebounded 2.25%.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock jumped 3.55% to 258.71. It's now advanced for 13 straight sessions, with the last 12 in above average-average volume, both records.</p>
      <p>Overnight, Tesla raised the U.S. price of the Model Y by $250. After slashing prices to start the year, Tesla has tweaked them higher where it can.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Stock</h3>
      <p>Nvidia rose 3.9% to 410.22, clearing the bulk of a three-weeks-tight pattern to a record close — and closing above a $1 trillion market cap for the first time. Existing investors could have added a tiny amount to their NVDA stock here, but definitely would have wanted some quick stops to exit the position. Nvidia stock is 13% above its 21-day line and 97% above its 200-day line. With the risks of a Nasdaq pullback rising, NVDA could easily fall back.</p>
      <h3>LSCC Stock</h3>
      <p>Lattice Semi stock popped 4.1% to 90.81, a day after retaking the 50-day line, both in higher volume. Investors could have used Tuesday's move as an early entry, though it backed off an intraday high of 94.25. At this point, investors could wait to see if LSCC stock forges a handle on its consolidation, which currently has a 96.82 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.</p>
      <h3>Unity Stock</h3>
      <p>Unity Software stock leapt 7.2% to 38.58 in heavy volume yet again. Shares stopped just short of a 39.45 cup-with-handle buy point intraday, but did break the downtrend of the handle, offering an early entry.</p>
      <h3>VRTX Stock</h3>
      <p>Vertex stock edged up 0.4% to 342.10. On Monday, shares rose 1.9% in strong trade, bouncing above the 21-day line and the 50-day. That offered an early entry in a flat base within a base-on-base formation. The official buy point is 354.46.</p>
      <h3>FCX Stock</h3>
      <p>Copper mining giant Freeport-McMoRan stock jumped 5.3% to 39.82, rebounding from the 50-day line and breaking a downtrend going back to the late January peak. Investors could have used that move as an early entry into FCX stock.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally is showing increasing strength and breadth, though techs are starting to look extended.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq is now 9% above its 50-day moving average, with the Nasdaq 100 up 10.1% over the key level. At 10%, the risks of a pullback rise, with a growing chance of a more-significant pullback.</p>
      <p>Advancers led declines by 2-to-1, with new highs crushing new lows. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) climbed 0.8%, also hitting a three-month high like the Russell 2000.</p>
      <p>The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) ran up 1%. That outpaced the Nasdaq 100's 0.8% gain, even with megacaps Tesla and Nvidia charging higher.</p>
      <p>Chips, software and homebuilders have been leaders for some time. Now industrials, airlines, miners and China names are making moves, though many are already extended.</p>
      <p>Some medical products firms and biotechs are near buy points without being extended, along with some casino and gaming plays. But that also means that many haven't taken part in the market's advance over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>A Nasdaq-led pullback would not be a surprise, and would probably be healthy. The wider breadth and leadership suggests that the market rally is in better condition to handle a tech pause or modest retreat.</p>
      <p>The Fed announcement and Powell's comments are sure to swing markets Wednesday afternoon. That could continue in a second-day reaction Thursday.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally continues to power higher, with a wider array of leaders.</p>
      <p>But a lot of leading stocks, even newer ones such as industrials and travel plays, look extended, even from their moving average. Many growth plays are highly extended.</p>
      <p>What investors need now is patience. If you haven't jumped on board many of these names, you probably need to wait for new entries to develop. For, say, industrials that have run up to or near buy points, handles or brief consolidations could create new buying chances. For many techs, a longer pullback or pause may be needed to let moving averages catch up or new bases form.</p>
      <p>If you do own some big winners, make sure you have an exit strategy.</p>
      <p>With the market rally's breadth and leadership expanding, investors have to keep up. Keep updating your watchlists, which should have expanded significantly in the past few weeks.</p>

    	<p>Dow Jones futures: The Nasdaq hit a fresh 2023 high ahead of key inflation data and the Fed meeting. Tesla stock extended its win streak.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures, along with S&P futures and Nasdaq futures, were little changed ahead of Tuesday's open after the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 189 points Monday. Tesla stock extended a win streak to 12 sessions, closing at its highest level since September 2022.</p>	
    	<p>Ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve interest-rate hike decision, the consumer price index is due out Tuesday morning. May's CPI is seen rising 0.3% on the month, with the annual inflation rate easing to 4.1% from 4.9%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, is forecast to rise 0.4%, lowering the core inflation rate to 5.3% from 5.5%.</p>	
    	<p>On Wednesday, the Fed is widely expected to skip a rate hike at its two-day policy meeting. The move would pause the 10 consecutive rate increases begun in March last year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) earnings came out late Monday, topping Wall Street's estimates. ORCL stock jumped 3% in extended trade. Shares are in the 20%-25% profit area from a 91.22 cup-with-handle buy point following a late-March breakout move.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%. The S&P 500 gained 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 1.5%, hitting a new 2023 high.</p>
      <p>EV leader Tesla traded up 2.2% Monday. Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple (AAPL) rose 1.6% and Microsoft (MSFT) gained 1.55% in today's stock market action.</p>
      <p>Dexcom (DXCM), Floor & Decor (FND), Fortinet (FTNT) and Kinsale Capital (KNSL) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Cisco Systems (CSCO), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to buy or watch in the stock market uptrend.</p>
      <p>Tesla is an IBD Leaderboard stock, while Floor & Decor is an IBD SwingTrader stock and was IBD's Stock Of The Day on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stock Futures Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>Ahead of Tuesday's opening bell, Dow Jones futures, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures, were little changed vs. fair value in overnight trading. Remember that overnight action in Dow Jones futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 3.76% Monday, closing just off its late-May highs. Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices moved down more than 4% Monday, as West Texas Intermediate futures settled just above $67 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>What To Do In The Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column with the stock market trend in a "confirmed uptrend."</p>
      <p>A confirmed uptrend gives IBD readers the green light to purchase top stocks breaking out past new buy points. Due to the bullish action in recent sessions, IBD's recommended exposure in stocks is at 60% to 80% of your portfolio, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached fresh 2023 closing highs.</p>
      <p>Two useful IBD MarketSmith lists to check right now are "Breaking Out Today" and "Near Pivot." The latter shows stocks nearing buy points in bases, and the other flags stocks rising past buy points during the session.</p>
      <p>To find more stock ideas, check IBD Stock Lists, like IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Stocks Near A Buy Zone. These features identify bullish patterns and buy points and should be checked every day.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Cisco, JPMorgan, Salesforce</h3>

      <p>Salesforce rallied past alternative entries at 193.91 and 200 in recent weeks, according to IBD Leaderboard analysis. In recent weeks, shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry, and are now bouncing from support at the 10-week line.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Dexcom, Floor & Decor, Fortinet, Kinsale</h3>
      <p>Dexcom broke out past a flat base's 126.44 buy point, with a 2.1% rally Monday, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. The 5% buy area goes up to 132.76.</p>
      <p>IBD SwingTrader stock Floor & Decor decisively regained its 50-day line during Wednesday's 5.1% advance, placing the flooring retailer in a new buy area. FND stock is just 4% away from a conventional buy point at 101.39.</p>

      <p>Last week, shares advanced for a fourth-straight week, racing 14% higher.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock rose for a third day, with a 1.6% gain Monday. Shares hit an all-time high at 184.95 last week and are just off that level. The stock continues to hold sharply above a 157.38 buy point.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares rose 1.55% Monday, rebounding for a third-straight session and nearly recovering from Wednesday's 3.1% sell-off. MSFT stock continues to hover around the 20%-25% profit-taking zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors could have taken at least some profits.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones rose Monday ahead of this week's inflation data and two-day Fed meeting. AMD and Amazon rallied on price-target hikes.</p>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose Monday ahead of a big week for the stock market, including key inflation data and the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Amazon (AMZN) rallied on analyst price-target hikes.</p>	
    	<p>On the economic front this week, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to skip a rate hike at its two-day policy meeting that wraps up on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The move would pause the 10 consecutive rate increases begun in March last year.</p>	
      <p>Ahead of that crucial decision, the consumer price index — an inflation report that could potentially influence the Fed's decision on Wednesday, is due out Tuesday morning. May's CPI is seen rising 0.3% on the month, with the annual inflation rate easing to 4.1% from 4.9%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, is forecast to rise 0.4%, lowering the core inflation rate to 5.3% from 5.5%.</p>
      <p>Further, the producer price index, out Wednesday at 8:30 a.m., is expected to show wholesale inflation slowing to 1.1% from 2.3%. Core PPI inflation is forecast to ease to 2.9% from 3.2%.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) earnings are due out after Monday's close. Shares are at the 20%-25% profit area from a 91.22 cup-with-handle buy point following a late-March breakout move.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today: AMD, Amazon Rally</h3>
      <p>AMD stock rose nearly 3% after Keybanc raised its price target from 110 to 150, while keeping its overweight rating. Amazon shares climbed almost 1% after BofA upped its target from 139 to 154, with a buy rating.</p>
      <p>EV giant Tesla, up 11 days in a row, rose another 1.7% Monday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) traded higher after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Dexcom (DXCM), Floor & Decor (FND), Fortinet (FTNT) and Kinsale Capital (KNSL) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Cisco Systems (CSCO), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to buy or watch in the stock market uptrend.</p>
      <p>Tesla is an IBD Leaderboard stock, while Floor & Decor was IBD's Stock Of The Day on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Monday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite traded 0.5% higher in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded up 0.5%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rose 0.3% early Monday.</p>
      <p>With the Federal Reserve's June meeting this week, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Monday ticked lower to 3.73%. On Friday, the 10-year yield edged higher, still near its late-May highs.</p>
      <p>Oil prices suffered another round of losses Monday morning, after Goldman Sachs cut its price outlook for the year by 10%. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped more than 3% Monday, moving below $68 a barrel — the low end of what has been their trading range since early May.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both rose 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.2%.</p>
      <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "the fact that decliners outnumbered advancers by almost 2-to-1 on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq could be a sign of some underlying weakness, though volume was mixed. The way indexes faded from early gains also indicated selling into strength."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column after the recent bullish change in the market's outlook.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Cisco, JPMorgan, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones networking giant Cisco Systems added a handle to a cup base last week, now showing a buy point at 50.58. CSCO stock rose 0.2% Monday.</p>
      <p>Dow Jones banking leader JPMorgan is nearing a 143.37 flat-base buy point after a four-day win streak. Shares are just 2% away from their latest buy point. JPM stock lost 0.1% early Monday.</p>

      <p>In recent weeks, shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry, and are now bouncing from support at the 10-week line. CRM stock added 0.7% Monday morning.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Dexcom, Floor & Decor, Fortinet, Kinsale</h3>

      <p>IBD SwingTrader stock Floor & Decor decisively regained its 50-day line during Wednesday's 5.1% advance, placing the flooring retailer in a new buy area. FND stock is just 5% away from a conventional buy point at 101.39. FND stock lost 1.3% early Monday.</p>
      <p>Insurance leader Kinsale Capital closed Friday in the 5% buy area past a 345.75 buy point. The buy zone runs up to 363.04. KNSL stock was down 0.1% Monday.</p>
      <p>Recent IBD Stock Of The Day, Fortinet, remains below its flat base's 69.07 buy point amid Friday's 1.4% drop. Shares were up 0.8% Monday.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Tesla rallied 4.1% Friday, moving further out of buy range beyond a double-bottom base's 207.79 buy point. Shares closed Friday 22% off their 52-week high.</p>
    	<p>TSLA stock looked to add to its extended win streak, rallying nearly 2% Monday morning. Last week, shares advanced for a fourth-straight week, racing 14% higher.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple stock rose for a second day, with a 0.2% gain Friday, Shares hit an all-time high at 184.95 last week. The stock continues to hold sharply above a 157.38 buy point and is out of the buy range that ran up to 165.35. AAPL stock rose 0.3% in morning trade Monday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares rose 0.5% Friday, recovering another small part of Wednesday's 3.1% selloff. Last week, MSFT stock reached the 20%-25% profit zone from a 276.76 flat-base buy point, so investors could have taken at least some profits there. On Monday morning, MSFT stock was up 0.5%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>By Noel Randewich and Shristi Achar A</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied on Monday to their highest closing levels since April 2022, while Oracle hit a record high ahead of quarterly results as investors awaited inflation data and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision this week.</p>	
    	<p>Lifted by gains in market heavyweights Amazon, Apple and Tesla, the S&P 500 has now recovered 21% from its October 2022 lows. Some investors say Wall Street is the midst of a bull market.</p>	
    	<p>"The further out the October lows get in the rear view mirror, the more confident investors become. Have investors become more complacent? They probably have, and that's actually a good sign," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.,</p>
      <p>Tesla rose 2.2% and has now climbed for 12 straight trading sessions, a record for the electric car maker.</p>
      <p>Apple and Microsoft each rose about 1.5%, with year-to-date gains in the two technology companies' shares reaching 41% and 38%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 climbed 0.93% to end the session at 4,338.93 points.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq gained 1.53% to 13,461.92 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.56% to 34,066.33 points.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Labor Department's consumer price index reading on Tuesday is expected to show inflation cooled slightly in May, with core prices likely remaining sticky. Tuesday is also first day of the Fed's two-day meeting.</p>
      <p>Traders see a 76% chance of the central bank holding rates at the 5%-5.25% range on Wednesday, while pricing in a 71% chance of a rate hike in July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.</p>
      <p>"There's a chance that the Fed will stay data dependent. So we don't necessarily think that a rate hike is off the table in the future, but for the near term we just see them staying steady," said Dylan Kremer, co-chief investment officer of Certuity.</p>
      <p>Gains in megacap stocks, better-than-expected quarterly earnings and hopes that the Fed might be nearing the end of its monetary tightening cycle have lifted indexes in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The rally has recently widened to include more economically sensitive sectors such as energy and industrials, as well as small-cap stocks, as data continues to show a resilient U.S. economy despite higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs on Friday raised its year-end price target for the benchmark S&P 500 to 4,500 from 4,000, citing the broadening of the market rally.</p>
      <p>The CBOE volatility index edged up to about 14.8, its highest since last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>After the bell, Oracle climbed 3.5% following its quarterly report. In Monday's trading session it rose as much as 7% to an all-time high after J.P. Morgan hiked its price target.</p>
      <p>Nasdaq Inc slumped almost 12% after the exchange operator said it would buy software firm Adenza for $10.5 billion, which analysts called an expensive bet.</p>
      <p>Biogen rose 1.5% after a U.S. FDA panel of advisers unanimously backed its Alzheimer's drug, Leqembi, raising expectations that a traditional approval for the treatment might not come with major new safety warnings.</p>
      <p>Broadcom Inc jumped 6.3% after Reuters reportedthe chipmaker was set to gain conditional EU antitrust approval for its $61 billion proposed acquisition of cloud computing firm VMware. That helped lift the Philadelphia semiconductor index 3.3%, bringing its recovery in 2023 to over 44%.</p>

    	<h3>n this article:</h3>
    	<p>A broader market rally is a reason to be bullish long term, but the Fed meeting is one reason to be cautious now. Biogen jumped late Friday. Watch Tesla and Nvidia.</p>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Tesla, Nvidia, On Holding, Biogen (BIIB), Oracle (ORCL), Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) are stocks to watch. But the focus will be on the Federal Reserve meeting amid two big inflation reports.</p>
    	<p>The stock market rally broadened last week, though that faded somewhat after Wednesday. The major indexes rose slightly for the week, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 right at 2023 highs. But small caps and midcaps had another solid gain, with market breadth trending higher, despite losers leading Friday.</p>	
    	<p>With the Fed meeting on tap and the Nasdaq still close to being extended, investors have reasons to be cautious right now about new buys, especially in hot tech sectors. But some stocks continue to flash buy signals.</p>	
    	<p>On Holding (ON) made a bullish move Friday. Nvidia (NVDA) has forged a new buy point. Can Tesla (TSLA) continue its win streak? A pause or pullback would be normal for Tesla stock, and perhaps help the Nasdaq cool off.</p>
      <p>ORCL stock is extended, but Oracle earnings late Monday could offer a gauge into business software and AI. Red-hot Adobe (ADBE) reports later in the week.</p>
      <h3>Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Wins Key Vote</h3>
      <p>Late Friday, an FDA advisory panel unanimously recommended approval for Biogen's Alzheimer's drug Leqembi.</p>
      <p>BIIB stock jumped 6.2% to 328 in late trading after being halted during Friday's regular session. That signals a breakout from a brand-new flat base, which is part of a base-on-base formation. The buy point is 319.74,</p>
      <p>Shares rose 2.9% to 308.88 in the week through Thursday, rebounding from the 50-day line and breaking a downtrend on hopeful signs for the advisory panel's vote. That offered an early entry.</p>
      <p>Eli Lilly stock rose 0.1% on Friday, not moving much on the FDA advisory panel vote just before the close. FDA approval of Biogen's Leqembi should be good news for Lilly's experimental Alzheimer's treatment donanemab. LLY stock has been consolidating near highs in the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, investors should keep their eyes on industrial stocks. Many are setting up or in buy areas, including Dow giants Boeing and Caterpillar stock.</p>
      <p>Tesla stock and Nvidia are on IBD Leaderboard, with ONON stock added to the Leaderboard watchlist on Friday. BA stock was added to SwingTrader. Tesla and ORCL stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20. On Holding was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article reviews the market action over the past week and analyzed On Holding, Boeing and Nvidia stock.</p>
      <h3>Fed Meeting</h3>
      <p>Markets expects policymakers to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its June 13-14 Fed meeting, but it's not a sure thing. The May CPI inflation report is due Tuesday morning, with the producer price out early Wednesday. Those could tip the scales just before the Fed meeting announcement.</p>
      <p>Assuming the Fed stands pat, it may be a "hawkish" pause. The Fed meeting statement and Fed chief Jerome Powell would likely stress the possibility of renewed rate hikes at a subsequent meeting. Indeed, markets are leaning toward a Fed rate hike in late July.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally showed a broad advance for the week, though the indexes and various sectors didn't move in lockstep during the week.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 popped 1.65%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 5 basis points to 3.74%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.2% to $70.17 a barrel last week. Copper futures climbed 1.8%.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1.1% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) popped 1.9%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) closed a fraction higher, with Oracle stock a notable component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) advanced 0.5%, with Nvidia stock a major holding.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) rose 1.7% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) rallied 2.4%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 3.6%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) popped 2.8% to the highest point since January 2022. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) advanced 1.8%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) edged up 0.1%. Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) climbed 1.45%, hitting a three-month high. Boeing and CAT stock are both big XLI holdings.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 1.% The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rallied 3%.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) gained 2.1% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) edged up 0.2%. Tesla stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
      <h3>ONON Stock</h3>
      <p>ONON stock climbed 5.4% to 30.24 on Friday. Shares got as high as 31.45, above its 50-day moving average, but closed just below that key level. Intraday, On Holding offered an early entry, but investors should now wait for a decisive move above the 50-day line, such as clearing Friday's peak. On Holding skyrocketed in late March on strong Q4 2022 earnings, continuing to rise into early May. Shares of the Swiss athletic shoe maker sold off hard in late May despite booming Q1 earnings, amid concerns about slowing growth later this year.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Stock</h3>
      <p>NVDA stock fell 1.4% to 387.70 last week, continuing to consolidate after gapping higher on May 25 following strong earnings and blowout guidance on AI-fueled chip demand. The graphics-chip maker now has a three-weeks tight, which offers the opportunity to add a few more shares. The official buy point is 419.38, at the top of the tight pattern, but a move above Friday's high of 397.11 could provide an entry. Even better, a pause for another week or two would let the 21-day line catch up.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock surged 14% to 244.40 last week, an eight-month high, extending its win streak to 11 sessions. Even more impressive, TSLA stock is up 10 straight days in higher volume. A deal to let General Motors (GM) use Tesla charging stations, and the entry Model 3 once again being eligible for the full $7,500 IRA tax credit in the U.S., were key drivers. Yes, bears can point to rising U.S. and European inventories despite various discounts, but the market isn't listening to that now. TSLA stock is now greatly extended from a 207.79 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. After such a strong run, at least a short-term pause seems likely, but it doesn't have to happen right away.</p>
      <h3>Dow Stocks Boeing, Caterpillar</h3>
      <p>Boeing stock rose 1.9% to 217.31 last week, rebounding from the 50-day line on Wednesday and clearing a trendline on Thursday, offering an early entry. BA stock is just below a 221.33 buy point from a flat base.</p>
      <p>CAT stock popped 3.7% to 235.03 last week and is up 14% so far in June. The heavy equipment giant broke a trendline going back to late January, offering an early entry. Caterpillar stock has an official buy point of 227.04.</p>
      <p>Terex (TEX), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Rockwell Automation (ROK) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) are among the many other industrial names showing some strength.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally offered reasons to be bullish longer term, but also reasons to be cautious in the short run.</p>
      <p>Market breadth has improved significantly over the past couple of weeks, though losers led winners on Friday. The small-cap Russell 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 had solid gains to three-month highs, though they did pull back late in the week. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) climbed 1%.</p>
      <p>The major indexes ended with slim weekly gains. The S&P 500 is right at 2023 highs, backing off Friday from just 3 points below the August peak during the week The Dow Jones found support at the 50-day line during the week and is moving toward 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq has now rallied for seven straight weeks, right at 52-week highs. The Nasdaq is 5.9% above its 10-week line with the Nasdaq 100 6.8% above that key level. Those are not extreme levels, but suggest that techs may have limited room to run before becoming stretched. So Friday's pullback from morning highs wasn't really a surprise. A pause would offer time for moving averages to catch up with the Nasdaq, and perhaps let some leaders forge new buying opportunities.</p>
      <p>Ideally, the rest of the market would pick up the slack. That appears to be happening, though not on Friday.</p>
      <p>Chips and software remain market leaders, generally holding recent gains. Industrials are joining building materials, homebuilders, medical products, travel plays as well as some biotechs and various restaurants as other leading groups.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>This may be a time to be cautious about new purchases, especially on techs, with the Nasdaq close to stretched and the Fed meeting on tap. If you do make new buys, be sure to have your exit strategies ready.</p>
      <p>But the outlook appears bullish for the stock market rally. Improving market breadth is helping a wider array of stocks set up. Some have been flashing buy signals while others are moving into position.</p>
      <p>Will this trend last? Don't try to predict where this market will go. Pay attention to what the market is doing right now.</p>
      <p>So definitely get your watchlists ready. Make sure to cast a wide net, so you catch industrial stocks and other reemerging areas of strength.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Stocks rose on Friday as investors digested a pairing between two of the largest American automakers and prepared for the Federal Reserve's next decision on rate hikes.</p>
    	<p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.12% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.13% or 44 points.</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq has risen for seven straight weeks while the S&P 500 is at its highest levels since August 2022.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 finished Thursday's trading sessions up more than 20% from its October 2022 lows, officially marking the start of a bull market. The stock rally to start 2023 comes as strong economic data continues to outweigh incessant recession fears.</p>
      <p>"I do believe that the worst is behind us," BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski, who recently boosted his S&P year-end price target from 4,300 to 4,550, told Yahoo Finance Live. "The Fed, maybe, has one more interest rate increase between now and the end of the year, and that's OK, but I think most of that has been already priced into the market."</p>
      <p>Shares of Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) both traded higher at the market open after GM announced Thursday it is joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric-vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The announcement comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.</p>
      <p>"This collaboration is a key part of our strategy and an important next step in quickly expanding access to fast chargers for our customers," GM CEO Mary Barra said in a press release.</p>
      <p>Tesla shares rose 4% on the news, extending an 11 day rally. The recent surge in Tesla shares is tied for the most consecutive days of gains ever.</p>
      <p>Shares of Docusign (DOCU) turned negative as the company beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings per share in the most recent quarter. Several Wall Street analysts reiterated sell ratings on the stock.</p>
      <p>"DocuSign attributed the out-performance to renewal timing, only passed a portion of the 1Q beat to the full year guide and sounded somber about the state of the demand backdrop," UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in a note to clients after the earnings release.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) stock gained 2.6% on Friday after new data from analytics platform Antenna showed US sign-ups for the streaming service jumped by the most in at least four and a half years following the streamer's password sharing crackdown launching last month.</p>
      <p>On the economic front, Friday is expected to be quiet. Markets projecting the Fed's next move are currently pricing in a 78% chance the Federal Reserve pauses its interest rate hike cycle at its meeting next week.</p>
      <p>"The FOMC is likely to pause at its June meeting next week to let the haze clear before it considers another rate hike," a Goldman Sachs team of economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The economists added: "The Fed leadership has signaled that it sees pausing as the prudent course because uncertainty about both the lagged effects of the rate hikes it has already delivered and the impact of tighter bank credit increases the risk of accidentally overtightening." </p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Dow Jones futures tilted higher Wednesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.</p>
	    <p>The stock market rally had a slightly positive session on big-cap indexes Tuesday. But small-cap and midcap stocks had a big day.</p>	
	    <p>Two big Cathie Wood holdings, Shopify (SHOP) and Coinbase Global (COIN), went in opposite directions Tuesday.</p>	
	    <p>SHOP stock rose solidly, extending Monday's advance and flashing an early entry.  TransMedics Group (TMDX), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Life Time Group (LTH) and Marriott International (MAR) made bullish moves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the SEC charged Coinbase with being an unlicensed broker and violating other securities rules. COIN stock tumbled 12%, though it did come off intraday lows. Coinbase stock fell just over 9% on Monday, below its 50-day and 200-day lines, after the SEC sued Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest bought the dip, adding more than 300,000 shares of COIN stock on Tuesday.</p>
	    <p>SHOP stock was added to IBD Leaderboard and SwingTrader on Tuesday. TMDX stock is on the IBD 50. Shopify also was Tuesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>	
	    <p>Early Wednesday, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) slightly beat fiscal first-quarter earnings views and nudged full-year estimates higher. OLLI stock rose in premarket trade, moving toward a cup-with-handle buy point. Ollie's has run back above the 200-day and 50-day line over the past three sessions.</p>	
	    <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.15% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%. Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla stock helped prop up the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, extending their recent runs.</p>
      <p>Crude oil prices climbed 1% and copper futures rose slightly.</p>
	    <p>China's exports fell 7.5% in May vs. a year earlier, far worse than expected. However, that does raise hopes for new economic stimulus. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.8%.</p>	
	    <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>	
	    <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally showed strong market breadth even as the major indexes traded in a tight range.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a fractional gain in Tuesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index rose 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 2.7%.</p>
	    <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell 0.6% to $71.74 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up 1 basis point to 3.7%.</p>	
	    <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1.5% to a 2023 high. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) edged up 0.2%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) climbed 0.7%. TSM stock is a major SMH component.</p>	
	    <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) gained 1.5% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) popped 2.3%. As stated above, COIN stock and Shopify are major holdings for Ark Invest's ETFs. Tesla (TSLA), Roku (ROKU) and DraftKings (DKNG) were other big components that had solid gains Tuesday.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) rose 2.4% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) 1.5%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 1.7%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 2.9%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) advanced 0.8% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) retreated 0.8%.</p>
	    <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) climbed 1.3%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) soared nearly 5%, hitting its best levels since late April.</p>	
      <h3>Stocks In Buy Zones</h3>
      <p>Shopify stock jumped 6.2% to 63.66, clearly breaking a trendline in a short consolidation. Volume was the heaviest since the huge three-day run following Q1 earnings. SHOP stock already was actionable Monday as it bounced from its 21-day line. It's starting to look extended. It's possible the e-commerce giant will forge a new base, but not until the end of next week.</p>	
	    <p>TransMedics stock leapt 6.2% to 79.40, rebounding from the 50-day line in strong volume. TMDX stock has a 90.15 buy point, but is actionable here.</p>
      <p>Taiwan Semiconductor stock climbed 1.8% to 99.82, moving back above the 98.99 consolidation buy point in above-average trade, according to MarketSmith analysis. The chip foundry giant sees stronger performance in the second half of 2023, and also guided capital spending to the low end of prior guidance. TSM stock gapped out of its base on May 25, following the blowout results and guidance from key customer Nvidia (NVDA), but soon pulled back. On Monday, shares retreated to just above their 21-day line before rebounding.</p>
	    <p>Life Time stock popped 4.2% to 20.94, reclaiming a 20.35 cup-base buy point in strong volume. Investors could view the past few weeks as a flat base with a 21.39 entry. LTH stock did get to an 18-month high of 21.75 intraday.</p>	
	    <p>Marriott stock rose 2.1% to 180.90, offering an early entry in an emerging flat base next to a yearlong cup-with-handle base. The MAR stock flat base won't be forged until Friday, but would have a 183.27 buy point. A move above the old buy point of 181.55 would be another entry and mark a 52-week closing high.</p>	
	    <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally had a dull day according to the major indexes, but there was underlying strength.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq rose but isn't getting significantly more extended. The S&P 500 continues to hold just below August 2022 highs. The Dow Jones pulled back to its 50-day line before reversing higher.</p>
	    <p>Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 and S&P 500 MidCap 400 both jumped to their best levels since March 9.</p>	
	    <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) rose 0.7%, hitting a one-month high after reclaiming the 50-day and 200-day lines last Friday.</p>	
	    <p>The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) edged up 0.2%, right at 52-week highs.</p>
      <p>Overall, winners beat losers by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq. The number of stocks hitting new highs easily beat those setting new lows.</p>
	    <p>The market rally has been led by a smaller number of tech titans and AI plays. Many of those names are pausing or at least not outpacing the field. That's probably healthy for those stocks and the broader market. That could help keep the Nasdaq from getting overheated as, hopefully, more groups join leadership.</p>	
	    <p>Homebuilders, building products, medical products and travel names are showing some strength.</p>	
	    <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>With the major indexes holding steady, market breadth showing a positive, tentative trend and a small number of buying opportunities, investors could keep adding buys gradually. It's an opportunity for lightly invested traders to bulk up exposure, while those who rode the AI wave can diversify their portfolio.</p>
      <p>Shakeouts remain common, while many stocks with deep bases look extended at traditional buy points. So look for early entries, and try to buy stocks as close to buy points as possible. This is where building your watchlists and setting alerts pays off. If you've done your homework, the real tests are a lot easier.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The stock market traded mildly higher amid a relatively quiet day of news on Tuesday. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the day's market action: Small caps took the reins amid a roughly 0.4% lift by the Nasdaq composite. Meanwhile, growth stocks in the IBD 50 and other key Investors.com stock lists continued to reward astute traders looking for breakouts.</p>
      <h3>Beating The Nasdaq</h3>    	
      <p>The Russell 2000 dominated the upside with a 2.7% gain. Midcap stocks nearly mirrored the bullish action, with SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 (MDY) rising almost 2.1%.</p>	
    	<p>At 1855, the small-cap Russell index is recouping even more losses caused by the downfall of regional banks SVB Financial and Signature Bank of New York in March. However, its year-to-date performance continues to lag.</p>	
    	<p>The Russell 2000 finished Tuesday with a 5.3% gain year to date, vs. advances of 26.8% by the Nasdaq composite and 11.6% by the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>Indeed, banks thrived on Tuesday, as SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) leapt 4.9%, its fourth largest single-session gain in the current quarter. KRE continued to make headway above its 50-day line, which is trying to flatten out.</p>
    	<p>Notice on a daily chart how the Russell 2000 index's 50-day line is now tilting a bit higher, a promising sign. (Note: the Russell 2000 chart updates once per day on Investors.com and MarketSmith; please use IWM for intraday action.)</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, the large-cap S&P 500 lagged with a gain of around 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded slightly lower. Volume was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Monday.</p>	
    	<p>The yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up less than 1 basis point to 3.69%.</p>
      <p>The last time the Russell 2000 gained more than 2.5% and the Dow finished lower was Oct. 10, 2008, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It's on track to be only the third such occurrence since the inception of the Russell 2000.</p>
    	<p>Elsewhere, the IBD 50 hosted no fewer than 14 issues that climbed 3% or more for the day.</p>	
    	<p>The IBD 50's top dog on Tuesday: Fluence Energy (FLNC), which is getting further past a cup with handle and the proper entry point just above 24.77.</p>	
    	<p>Notice on the weekly chart how Fluence also saw its relative strength line vault into new high ground since the base began forming near 26 in early February.</p>
      <p>The base has a lot of wide weekly swings, however, so beware of potential sharp pullbacks. Fluence Energy got some airplay in Tuesday's IBD Live show.</p>
    	<p>The midcap growth stock has a market value of $4.7 billion and 176 million shares outstanding. Over the past three fiscal reporting years through September 2022, Fluence piled a cumulative net loss of $3.12 a share. In FY 2023, analysts expect the provider of energy storage products and services to lose 64 cents a share, then turn a profit of 11 cents in FY 2024.</p>	
    	<p>Sales fell 14% vs. a year earlier in the June-ended fiscal third quarter last year to $239 million. But since then, the top line has roared higher, up 135%, 78% and 104% in the three most recent quarters through March.</p>	
    	<p>According to MarketSmith, 283 mutual funds owned shares in Fluence Energy as of the end of the first quarter, up from 254 in the year-ago period. Top-rated funds owning a piece of the stock include ClearBridge Value Trust (LGVAX).</p>
      <p>Fluence management owns 1% of the company.</p>
    	<p>On June 1, Fluence announced that it sealed contracts to supply its Nispera asset performance management software to seven solar power plants under the management of MPC Energy Solutions in El Salvador, Colombia and Mexico. The deal represents the company's entrance into the former two markets and business expansion in the latter.</p>	
    	<h3>Outside the Nasdaq: IOT Rockets</h3>
      <p>Samsara (IOT), which is now extended past a breakout point at 22.59, gushed higher in heavy volume for a third straight session. Shares rose as much as 6.7% and entered the 20% profit zone from its buy point.</p>	
    	<p>A new holder could consider holding the stock a minimum eight weeks and see if the specialist in harnessing data from the IoT (Internet of Things) realm and related markets can extend its gains.</p>
      <p>Samsara has yet to turn a profit. But the Street sees a profit of 3 cents a share in fiscal 2025, ending in January that year. Net losses continue to shrink as the top line expands.</p>
    	<p>Sales grew 52%, 49%, 48% and 43% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.</p>	
    	<p>According to IBD Stock Checkup, Samsara gets a seriously good 96 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Composite rating combines key fundamental, technical and institutional ownership metrics into a single easy-to-use number.</p>	
    	<p>Use the Composite Rating as a screening tool, not for timing your buys and sells.</p>
      <h3>Breakout In This Nasdaq Stock</h3>
      <p>Monday.com (MNDY) remains in the 5% buy zone after clearing a cup base at 171.89. Shares rose 1.4% to 179.31 in dull turnover on Tuesday and briefly notched a 52-week high.</p>
    	<p>The cup-like pattern also featured the contours of a double bottom base, another bullish chart pattern found among many of the greatest stock market winners, per decades of IBD research. This pattern yielded a lower buy point above 145.46.</p>	
    	<p>As the daily chart shows, MNDY had two key sell-offs in February to March and in April to early May. These declines produced a pair of lows at 126.05 and 108.34.</p>	
    	<p>The middle peak of 145.46 in between the two lows produced a new buy point. Monday.com raced past this new entry on strong first-quarter results issued on May 15. The bottom line jumped from a net loss of 96 cents a share a year earlier to a profit of 14 cents a share.</p>
      <p>The cloud-based platform helps workers more efficiently operate across multiple software applications. It hosts an 81 Earnings Per Share Rating that cloaks strong earnings in the past three quarters.</p>
    	<p>Sales have exceeded $600 million on a trailing 12-month basis and jumped 75%, 65%, 57% and 50% in the past four quarters.</p>	
    	<p>Monday.com's Composite Rating is also excellent at 98, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The midcap stock has a market value of $8.6 billion, 47.9 million shares outstanding and a float of 22 million.</p>	
    	<p>Keep in mind this significant gap between the float of freely traded shares and the total shares outstanding. According to MarketSmith, management owns 22% of the company, or roughly 10.5 million shares. The stock debuted on the Nasdaq in June 2021 at $155 a share.</p>
      <p>Two More Breakouts To Watch</p>
    	<p>Kinsale Capital (KNSL) is actionable as it clears a 345.75 buy point in a five-week base that carries the elements of a flat base. The stock rose 2.9% as volume jumped above average on an up day for the fourth straight session.</p>	
    	<p>The specialty property and casualty insurer traded on average 142,000 shares a day. On Tuesday, more than 204,000 shares exchanged hands, or 43% above its 50-day average.</p>	
    	<p>Outside the Nasdaq, Copa (CPA) is now extended. Shares in the Panama-based airline rolled 2.7% higher and are exiting the 5% buy zone from a breakout at 98.11. Watch for a potential pullback into the proper buy zone.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NYSE-listed tech stock Dynatrace (DT) briefly reentered the 5% buy range after recently jetting past a 48 buy point in a three-month-plus cup without handle. It is now extended.</p>
    	<p>From 48, the 5% buy zone goes up to 50.40. The expert in automation of IT operations fell briefly near 50 but cut its losses to less than 0.3%. Volume ran 27% above average.</p>

    	<p>S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, with contracts tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 0.1% in the red. Optimism that gripped markets and sent stocks higher after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report last Friday has come undone—largely as a result of the release of ISM services data that held grim signs for the health of the U.S. economy. “The week’s early optimism has been clouded by renewed concerns about a looming recession in America,” said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown.</p>
    	<p>U.S. stock futures slipped on Tuesday amid worries of an economic slowdown after gloomy data released on Monday. Against that backdrop, investors are shifting their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates, due in a week.</p>	
    	<p>Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 30 points, or 0.1%, after the index tumbled 199 points last Friday to close at 33,562. S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, with contracts tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 0.1% in the red.</p>	
    	<p>Optimism that gripped markets and sent stocks higher after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report last Friday has come undone—largely as a result of the release of ISM services data that held grim signs for the health of the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>“The week’s early optimism has been clouded by renewed concerns about a looming recession in America,” said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. “As the world’s largest economy shows more signs of heading for a contraction, with growth in the mighty services sector slowing more quickly than expected last month, worries are rising about the knock-on effect.”</p>
      <p>Investor attention is squarely on the next decision from the Fed, due after the June 13-14 meeting of its policy-setting committee, with markets responsive to economic data that could shift the needle in the interim. For now, that means mulling the ISM services print, but June 13’s consumer-price index (CPI) inflation data likely remains the most important release ahead of the Fed decision.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures rose modestly early Friday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Broadcom (AVGO) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) headlined earnings late Thursday with the jobs report on tap before the open. Tesla is looking to continue Thursday's breakout attempt.</p>
    	<p>The Senate passed debt-ceiling legislation Thursday night, sending it to President Biden for his signature. That will avoid a first-ever U.S. default.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market rally had a solid session Thursday. After starting off mixed, the major indexes should rebounded and moved higher, though they pared gains near the close. Market breadth was strong. Several stocks made bullish moves while some early earnings losers roared back. Falling Treasury yields and a weaker dollar provided a boost.</p>	
    	<p>Tesla (TSLA) stock is trying to break out, while archrival BYD (BYDDF) is just below a buy point. Wingstop (WING), Fluence (FLNC) and Uber Technologies (UBER) are all near entries.</p>
      <p>In addition to Broadcom and LULU stock, Zscaler (ZS), Asana (ASAN), Samsara (IOT), SentinelOne (S), MongoDB (MDB) reported late.</p>
      <p>Lululemon. Samsara and especially MDB stock were big overnight earnings winners. ASAN stock and Zscaler rose as well, with AVGO stock edging higher. SentinelOne stock crashed overnight. ZS stock, Asana and Samara all closed near buy points or early entries.</p>
      <p>WING stock was added to IBD Leaderboard on Thursday. MDB stock, Fluence, Wingstop and Uber are on the IBD 50. Wingstop was Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day. FLNC stock was Tuesday's selection.</p>
      <h3>Jobs Report</h3>
      <p>Economists expect the May jobs report to show nonfarm payrolls up 190,000, down from 253,000. The jobless rate should tick up from a long-term low to 3.5%. Average hourly earnings should climb 4.4% vs. a year earlier, steady with April.</p>
      <p>Other labor data this week have been robust, including April job openings and the May ADP Employment Report. But there are other indications that the labor markets haven't been as tight as previously thought.</p>
      <p>The jobs report will influence expectations for the June Fed meeting. Rate hike odds plunged Wednesday as two Fed officials signaled they favored a pause this month. Markets now see a 77% chance of a pause.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5%. AVGO stock is a notable S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 holding. So is Tesla.</p>
      <p>Crude oil rose 2%. Copper futures climbed nearly 2%.</p>
      <p>China's State Council is meeting Friday to discuss ways to boost the flagging economy. One option, according to a Bloomberg report, is to extend the purchase tax exemption for electric vehicles that cost less than 300,000 yuan ($42,400). The purchase tax exemption for all new energy vehicles was set to expire this year. That would be good news for many EV makers, including Tesla and BYD.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally strengthened for most of the session, before backing off in the final 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index climbed 1%. The Nasdaq composite popped 1.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 1.05%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices rebounded nearly 3% to $70.10 a barrel. Copper prices bounced 2.1%. Commodity prices were helped by a stronger Chinese economic data and a weaker U.S. dollar.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to 3.61%, down 21 basis points so far this week.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rose 1.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost a fraction. Sentinel One, Asana and ZS stock are in IGV. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gained 1.5%. AVGO stock is a big SMH component.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) climbed 1.5% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) popped 2.9%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns some BYD stock.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock rose 1.8% to 207.52. Intraday, shares hit 209.80, briefly clearing a 207.89 buy point from what's either a cup or double-bottom base. Notably, TSLA stock has advanced on above-average volume for four straight sessions, after few such days in the prior three months.</p>
      <p>Shares rose slightly early Friday, signaling a continuation of the breakout attempt.</p>
      <p>There had been speculation that Elon Musk would unveil a revamped Model 3 at the Shanghai plant on Thursday, but he did not. Meanwhile, Tesla is increasing discounts on U.S. inventory, choosing not to cut official prices for now.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BYD stock climbed 2% to 30.80 on Thursday, getting back toward a 31.17 cup-with-handle buy point initially cleared on May 10. On Thursday, BYD reported record deliveries in May, exceeding its late 2022 peak after a Tesla-led China EV price war took a toll earlier in 2023.</p>
      <h3>Other Stocks Near Buy Points</h3>
      <p>FLNC stock fell 2.4% to 24.20. Shares are slightly below a 24.87 handle buy point, but have been trading this week above an early entry from breaking the downtrend of the handle. Fluence Energy is in utility-scale storage. Much like Tesla's Megapack business, Fluence uses CATL batteries. Not yet profitable, but revenue growth is booming.</p>
      <p>WING stock dipped 0.3% to 198.44. Wingstop found support at its 10-week line this week, just above a prior buy point. Shares would be actionable above Wednesday's high of 202.43. That would also get WING stock above its 21-day line and break a downtrend in a short consolidation. Wingstop stock is on track to have a flat base by Friday's close.</p>
      <p>UBER stock rose 1.45% to 38.48, rebounding from the 21-day line. Technically, the ride-hailing giant is in range from a cup base with a 37.68 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. Investors could buy Uber stock here, or wait for a little more strength to break a short downtrend. Uber is an example of a stock that ran up straight from the bottom of its base. The pause over the past month has been constructive.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>Big-cap techs led Thursday's stock market rally, but it was a broad advance. The Nasdaq rose to just below Tuesday's nine-month high, and closed at its best level since mid-August. The S&P 500 set a fresh 2023 high.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones tested its 200-day line but rebounded higher. It's still below its 50-day line. The Russell 2000 reclaimed its 50-day but must work back to its 200-day average.</p>
      <p>Market breadth was strongly positive on Thursday, with winners leading losers by more than 2-to-1. However, new lows comfortably exceeded new highs.</p>
      <p>The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) advanced 0.7%, lagging the Nasdaq 100's 1.2% gain but match a 52-week closing high.</p>
      <p>The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) rallied 0.75%, but is still below key moving averages. RSP, along with the Russell 2000, reflects Thursday's broad advance but also the longer-term weak breadth.</p>
      <p>A few stocks broke out, but aside from Tesla they were extended from moving averages. There were a few add-on buys or swing trades such as Celsius (CELH), but you had to be quick.</p>
      <p>A lot of the AI, chip and software names that have been leading the market could use a rest. Some are greatly extended, while others have run straight up from the bottom of bases, but could use some tight action around buy points.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, other sectors can rejoin and expand market leadership, such as biotechs, medical products, travel and homebuilders. For that to happen, the market rally needs to see a steady diet of broad advances.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>Thursday's market action was positive, but it was just one day. Leadership remains narrow and breadth weak.</p>
      <p>There weren't a lot of buying opportunities Thursday. Some stocks need to rest, while others need to push higher. Let those setups develop. Don't try to force your way into higher exposure by buying extended stocks or others that are not yet in position.</p>
      <p>Instead, you should be tracking these leaders and potential leaders. Keep your watchlists up to date, focusing in on stocks that are close to being actionable and have high potential.</p>
      <p>Market exposure should still be modest. If a broad market rally takes hold, there will be plenty of opportunities to gradually bulk up your portfolio. On the flip side, be ready to scale out if individual holdings or the broader market weaken.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday after key economic data, with the release of ADP's employment report and the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims. Meanwhile, hot AI stock C3.ai (AI) crashed as much as 24% after its first-quarter earnings report.</p>
    	<p>ADP's employment report showed May jobs growth of 278,000, much stronger than the expected 160,000 figure, but still down slightly from April's 296,000 number. ADP's report is a precursor to Friday's jobs data from the Labor Department.</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, initial jobless claims rose to 232,000, slightly below the 235,000 forecast vs. 229,000 in the previous week. (For the latest coverage of the market, visit our Stock Market Today page.)</p>	
    	<p>Further, the PMI manufacturing index came in at 48.4, slightly below the 48.5 estimate. Finally, the May ISM manufacturing index fell to 46.9, below the 47.0 estimate compared to April's 47.1 reading,</p>
      <p>C3.ai, which preannounced some fiscal fourth-quarter results in mid-May, issued a full-year fiscal 2024 revenue outlook that missed analyst estimates. The stock had rallied more than 20% this week, but is poised to lose most of it.</p>
      <p>Other key earnings movers include Chewy (CHWY), CrowdStrike (CRWD), NetApp (NTAP), Nordstrom (JWN), Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV).</p>
      <p>Chewy shares jumped 20%, while CrowdStrike reported April-quarter profit and revenue that topped analyst estimates. CRWD stock tumbled 8.5% as growth in a key metric, annual recurring revenue, slowed.</p>
      <p>NetApp rallied more than 6% in early trade, as Nordstrom stock moved up 9.3%.</p>
      <p>CRM stock sold off almost 8%, while Veeva shares surged 13%. Also, Okta plunged 19% in early morning trade.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>Lucid Motors (LCID) skidded 13% after announcing a $3 billion stock offering and a separate private placement. Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) traded almost 2% lower Thursday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were lower after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Arista Networks (ANET), IBD Leaderboard stock ASML (ASML), Cloudflare (NET) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to buy and watch in the stock market uptrend.</p>
      <p>Arista was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day, while ASML and Salesforce are IBD Leaderboard stocks. And Cisco was featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Thursday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gained 0.1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded down 0.1%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) fell 0.15% early Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Thursday traded down to 3.58%. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield fell sharply for a second straight day.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil prices dropped Thursday morning, extending this week's losses. West Texas Intermediate futures lost 0.5% Thursday, sending West Texas intermediate futures below $68 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite also lost 0.6%, easing from its 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>Wednesday's Big Picture column commented, "So, for tech investors, after a tawdry 2022, the first five months ought to feel a whole lot nicer. But in this tale of two equity markets, blue chips outside the tech realm have truly been mixed."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column after the recent bullish change in the market's outlook.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Cisco, Boeing, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones networking giant Cisco Systems is building a cup base with a 52.66 buy point. Keep an eye out for a potential handle, which would show an earlier entry. CSCO stock declined 1% Wednesday, snapping a three-day win streak. CSCO stock fell 0.4% Thursday.</p>
      <p>Dow Jones aerospace giant Boeing climbed 0.5% Wednesday, closing back above its 50-day line. Shares are still forming a flat base with a 221.43 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. BA stock moved up 0.6% early Thursday.</p>
      <p>Salesforce rallied past alternative entries at 194.01 and 200.10 in recent weeks, according to Leaderboard analysis. Meanwhile, its relative strength line hit a new high Wednesday, a bullish signal. Shares reached the 20% profit zone from a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry, so investors would be justified to take some profits ahead of the company's first-quarter results late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>CRM stock tumbled more than 6% Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, Salesforce reported April-quarter earnings and revenue that topped analyst estimates as operating margins improved amid cost-cutting spurred by activist investors. Its revenue outlook only edged by views.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: Arista, ASML, Cloudflare, TSMC</h3>
      <p>Networking giant Arista Networks fell sharply below its 171.54 buy point during Wednesday's 4.6% drop, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. ANET stock gained 0.5% Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock ASML remains just out of buy range past a 683.28 buy point in a cup with handle despite Wednesday's 0.7% fall. ASML rose 0.6% Thursday.</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity leader Cloudflare broke out Wednesday past a 66.30 buy point in a double bottom. Shares closed in the 5% buy area, which runs up to 69.62. NET stock moved down 1.7% Thursday, heading lower in sync after earnings from CrowdStrike and Okta.</p>
      <p>Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor dropped 3.3% Wednesday, falling back into buy range past a double-bottom's 95.92 buy point. The 5% buy area runs up to 100.72. TSM stock climbed 1% Thursday morning.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock rallied 1.4% Wednesday, moving closer to a cup base's 207.89 buy point. The stock is above its long-term 200-day line for the first time since Sept. 21. Shares closed Wednesday 35% off their 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock looked to add Wednesday's gains, but turned lower Thursday morning, falling 1.7%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares edged lower Wednesday, snapping a four-day win streak after hitting a new 52-week high at 179.35. The stock continues to hold sharply above a 157.48 buy point and is out of the buy range that ran up to 165.35. AAPL stock fell 0.1% in morning trade Thursday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares reversed from new highs, falling nearly 0.9% Wednesday. They traded as high as 335.94. Shares have reached the 20%-25% profit zone from a 276.86 flat-base buy point, so investors could take at least some profits here. On Thursday morning, MSFT stock was down 0.8%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The jump in S&P 500's big tech stocks is masking concerns among investors that the US is already in recession, BlackRock Investment Institute says.</li>
        <li>The index on an equal-weighted basis is down so far in 2023.</li>
        <li>The US has logged back-to-back quarters of contraction in gross domestic income.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Nvidia stock is crushing it this year along with other mega-cap tech shares in the S&P 500, but BlackRock says stripping out those big movers reveals that investors may believe that the US economy is already contracting.</p>
    	<p>Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are the S&P 500's five largest stocks by market capitalization, and they've largely held sway over its direction this year. Nvidia's stock has rocketed up 170% on the buzz about AI technology, and the chipmaker on Tuesday was briefly thrust beyond a $1 trillion valuation.</p>	
    	<p>But for the S&P 500, a "deeper look reveals stocks reflect worsening growth," Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, said in a note published this week.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 has tacked on about 9% this year. But the group said after applying equal weighting to all of the index's constituents regardless of size, it's down by more than 1%.</p>
      <p>BlackRock's reference to growth stems from its view that the effect of rate hikes by global central banks to tame inflation is starting to kick in. Recent data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, indicates that the country has entered a recession despite experiencing an energy shock that was less severe than widely anticipated.</p>
      <p>"In the U.S., GDP has held up but it has arguably entered recession based on gross domestic income, which assesses the economy's performance on an income rather than spending basis," said Boivin.</p>
      <p>Last week, the government said gross domestic income declined 2.3% in the first quarter of 2023 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. That followed a 3.3% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2002, with the back-to-back quarterly shrinkage indicating a recession. Gross domestic income measures incomes earned and costs incurred in production.</p>
      <p>And with inflation still running above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, policymakers may deliver another increase in interest rates.</p>
      <p>"Markets are no longer pricing in repeated Fed rate cuts, a sign they're grasping inflation's persistence, in our view," said BlackRock.</p>
      <p>The Fed in May issued its 10th consecutive rate hike. Its aggressive series of hikes last year contributed to driving the S&P 500 down more than 18% last year. The benchmark Fed funds rate stood at 5%-5.25%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 275 points Friday after hot inflation data, with the release of critical consumer pricing data. Meanwhile, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) dived after missing Wall Street's sales estimates in its latest quarter.</p>
    	<p>The Commerce Department's April Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, or PCE, rose 0.4% on the month, with a 4.4% annual increase, hotter than Wall Street's estimates. The core PCE index climbed 0.4% on the month, with a 4.7% annual rise, also above forecasts.</p>	
    	<p>Ulta Beauty shares dived nearly 12% Friday morning after missing sales estimates in the first quarter.</p>	
    	<p>Other key earnings movers include Autodesk (ADSK), Costco (COST), Deckers Outdoor (DECK), Gap (GPS), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Workday (WDAY).</p>
      <p>Autodesk shares rose 1.8% in morning trade, while Costco dropped 0.2%. DECK stock declined more than 5%, as Gap shares jumped 10%. Marvell stock surged 22%, while Workday shares rallied 10%.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) traded nearly 3% higher Friday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were higher after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), IBD Leaderboard stock ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA) and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the best stocks to buy and watch in the stock market uptrend.</p>
      <p>ASML and Salesforce are IBD Leaderboard stocks, and Boeing was featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 1.1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) traded up 0.7%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rose 0.6% early Friday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Friday traded up to 3.83%. The 10-year yield is at its highest level since mid-March.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil prices looked to rebound Friday morning after Thursday's sharp losses. West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1% Friday, sending WTI futures near $73 a barrel.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Action</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, extending a losing streak to five sessions and falling further below its 50-day line. It is now testing the 200-day line.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 rebounded 0.9%, snapping a two-day slide and finding support around its own 50-day line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 1.7%, nearly erasing the past two days of losses. Finally, the small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%, closing at its lowest level since May 17.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column cautioned, "There was narrow participation in Thursday's advance. (The) Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) inched lower and (the) First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight (QQEW) moved up just 0.5%. Despite the Nasdaq's surge, more than twice as many Nasdaq stocks fell than rose on Thursday."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column after the recent bullish change in the market's outlook.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: Boeing, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones aerospace giant Boeing climbed 0.8% Thursday, still below its 50-day line. Shares are still forming a flat base with a 221.43 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. BA stock moved up 0.5% early Friday.</p>
      <p>Salesforce rallied past alternative entries at 194.01 and 200.10 in recent weeks, according to Leaderboard analysis. Meanwhile, its relative strength line hit a new high this week, a bullish signal. Salesforce reports first-quarter results after the market close on May 31. CRM stock jumped 1.4% Friday morning after Citigroup raised its price target from 210 to 229.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: AMD, ASML, TSMC</h3>
      <p>Chip leader Advanced Micro Devices moved further out of buy range above a cup base's 102.53 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition, with an 11.2% surge Thursday. The 5% buy area went up to 107.66. AMD shares rallied 1.3% Friday.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock ASML bullishly reclaimed its 683.28 buy point in a cup with handle during Thursday's 6.25% advance. ASML added 1.2% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor soared 12% Thursday, breaking out past a 95.92 double-bottom entry. The 5% buy area runs up to 100.72, so the stock is slightly extended. TSM stock rose another 1% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Tesla Stock</p>
      <p>Tesla stock moved up 0.9% Thursday, ending a two-day skid. So far, shares are finding support around their 50-day line, as they build a cup base with a 207.89 buy point for now. Keep an eye out for a handle to offer a lower entry. Shares closed Thursday 41% off their 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock looked to add to Thursday's gains, moving up 2.8% Friday morning.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jines Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares climbed 0.7% Thursday, rising for a second straight day. Shares remain just off their recent 52-week high at 176.39. The stock continues to hold sharply above a 157.48 buy point and is out of the buy range that ran up to 165.35. AAPL stock rose 1.2% Friday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares jumped 3.85% Thursday, hitting a new 52-week high at 326.90. Shares are significantly above a 276.86 flat-base buy point. On Friday morning, MSFT stock was up 0.8%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures tilted higher Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet today for face-to-face debt-ceiling talks. China sanctions vs. Micron Technology (MU) weighed on chip stocks.</p>
    	<p>Nvidia earnings loom large this week.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market rally strengthened last week on debt-ceiling deal optimism and easing bank fears, with gains led by AI-infused tech leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), ServiceNow (NOW), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Snowflake (SNOW) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR).</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 hit 2023 highs, with the Nasdaq 100 setting its best levels in more than a year. For much of the week, the White House and congressional leaders appeared to be moving toward a debt-ceiling deal while concerns about regional banks waned.</p>
      <p>On Friday, GOP negotiators suspended debt-ceiling talks, saying President Biden's White House was being unreasonable. At around the same time, a report came out stating that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told bank execs that more bank mergers may be needed. That hit regional bank stocks Friday, though they rose strongly for the week.</p>
      <p>The major indexes took the debt-ceiling setback and Yellen's comments in stride Friday. That's in part because around the same time Fed chief Jerome Powell signaled he favors a rate pause next month.</p>
      <p>The stock market rally remains somewhat split, with narrow leadership. Still, investors can be adding exposure carefully, though not a lot of stocks are offering buying opportunities at the moment.</p>
      <p>Tesla (TSLA) made a bullish move this past week amid its shareholder event, clearing some key levels. But TSLA stock faces further resistance.</p>
      <h3>Debt Ceiling Talks</h3>
      <p>Investors have remained confident in a debt-limit deal, but doubts may be growing.</p>
      <p>President Biden had a phone call with Speaker McCarthy Sunday morning as he flew back from the Group of Seven meeting in Japan. McCarthy said it was a "productive" call, but "there's no agreement. We're still apart."</p>
      <p>White House and House GOP negotiators met Sunday. Biden and McCarthy will meet Monday.</p>
      <p>Earlier Sunday, President Biden said that he's "looking at the 14th Amendment" to declare debt limits invalid, saying "I think we have the authority." That's much further than the president has gone before. But he worries that the U.S. could default amid court challenges to that untested legal option. "The question is could it be done and invoked in time."</p>
      <p>The U.S. is likely to hit the debt ceiling in early June.</p>
      <h3>Micron, Meta Face Overseas Sanction</h3>
      <p>China warned key Chinese information infrastructure operators against buying Micron Technology (MU) chips, saying it found "relatively serious" cybersecurity risks. Beijing is targeting the U.S. memory-chip maker as it begins to retaliate vs. U.S. chip export bans to China.</p>
      <p>MU stock fell modestly, off initial premarket lowers. A number of other chip stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, edged lower.</p>
      <p>The European Union on Monday fined Meta Platforms (META) a record $1.3 billion for sending user information to the U.S.. META stock fell slightly.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures edged higher.</p>
      <p>PacWest Bancorp (PACW) will sell 74 real estate loans to Kennedy-Wilson (KW) worth $2.6 billion for $2.4 billion. PACW stock rose solidly while KW advanced slightly.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Earnings</h3>
      <p>Nvidia earnings Wednesday night will be a big deal. NVDA stock is everything that's going right with the market rally. It's the leading megacap and AI stock in a market rally dominated by megacaps and AI plays. Nvidia shares leapt 10% last week and it's significantly extended.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock pausing or pulling back modestly over several weeks would be healthy. But if Nvidia earnings or guidance disappoint, NVDA could be punished severely. That also could have repercussions for rival AMD as well as Google and a slew of "AI" plays that have been driving the market higher.</p>
      <p>ServiceNow stock took off last week amid AI-related alliances with Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT). SNOW stock gained on a report that it could buy an AI search firm. PLTR stock, long an AI play, vaulted 23% for the week after the prior week's 28% spike on earnings. Google stock has leapt 14% so far in May.</p>
      <h3>Other Key Earnings</h3>
      <p>Snowflake, Elf Beauty (ELF), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) also have earnings this week.</p>
      <p>SNOW stock is in a 10-month consolidation. ELF stock is consolidating at its 21-day line after a huge run. PANW stock is trying to hold its 50-day line within a new, volatile flat base. DECK stock had been a big winner but tumbled this past week below its 50-day line as On Holding (ONON) and Foot Locker (FL) dived on their results.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock is on IBD Leaderboard, with ELF stock on the Leaderboard watchlist. SNOW stock is on the IBD 50. NOW stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in the article discussed the weekly market action and reviewed three non-AI plays setting up: Life Time Group (LTH), Meritage Homes (MTH) and MercadoLibre (MELI).</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally advanced last week, with a big gap between leaders and laggards.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index advanced 1.65%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 bounced 1.9%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield leapt 23 basis points to 3.69%, hitting a two-month high.</p>
      <p>The odds of a Fed rate hike next month briefly topped 40% during the week amid strong economic data and some hawkish comments from Fed officials. But with Powell saying "we can afford to look at the data," the chance slipped back to about 20% on Friday.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures climbed 2.2% to $71.55 a barrel for the week.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) surged 5.25% last week. NOW stock is a big IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) soared 8.5%. Nvidia stock is a major SMH holding, along with AMD stock. Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) rose 2.7% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) gained 3%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest ETFs. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns some PLTR stock.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) slipped 0.5%, its fifth straight weekly loss. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 4.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 1.2%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gained 1.4%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) slipped 0.7%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 2.2% The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rebounded 7.8%, even with Friday's 1.8% retreat.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock A Buy?</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock rallied 7.2% last week to 180.14, rebounding from near the 21-day line and retaking the 50-day line for the first time since early April.</p>
      <p>Investors responded well to Tuesday's Tesla shareholder day. CEO Elon Musk reiterated that the Cybertruck will begin deliveries this year, while again hinting at a next-generation vehicle. Musk also said Tesla will "try" some advertising. Like any savvy CEO in 2023, he made sure to mention "AI" several times.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tesla quietly offered some new inventory discounts on U.S. Model 3 vehicles, following recent discounts on Model 3 and Y vehicles in Europe. Inventory discounts don't get the headlines that official price cuts do, but they hit profit margins all the same. The balance between production, deliveries and prices is the key Tesla story in 2023.</p>
      <p>Investors could view Friday's move above the 50-day moving average as an early entry for Tesla stock. But it would be extremely aggressive. Tesla still faces the 200-day line, which is coming down toward 200. Just above that is a 207.89 buy point, just above the March 31 high. That's either from a seven-week consolidation or a three-month double-bottom buy point.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally showed strength last week, but the advance remains narrow. The Nasdaq boomed, hitting a 2023 high, with the S&P 500 also doing so late in the week.</p>
      <p>The Russell 2000, buoyed by bank stocks, also had a solid week, but is well off 2023 highs. The Dow Jones eked out a small weekly gain after undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The tech rally has expanded from megacap stocks such as Google and Nvidia to big-cap chip and software names such as AMD, ServiceNow and AI plays such as Palantir. But most are extended now.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100 hit a 52-week high, up 3.5% for the week. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which had been struggling, popped 2.45%. It's close to 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>But overall breadth remains lackluster. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) climbed nearly 1%, but slipped back below its 200-day line on Friday. RSP isn't much closer to its 2023 highs than its October bear market lows.</p>
      <p>Losers led advancers on Friday after modestly positive breadth on Thursday. But new highs outpaced losers for a second straight session.</p>
      <p>Beyond chips, software and megacap stocks, homebuilders, building materials, medical products and biopharma names are acting well. So are travel plays and some payment stocks.</p>
      <p>Shoe-related stocks were heels this past week due to ONON and Foot Locker. Deckers Outdoor, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), will try to put their best foot forward.</p>
      <p>Debt-ceiling talks, banking concerns and recession risks remain big issues for the market rally. While Wall Street and political analysts still see a debt-limit deal as highly likely, various headlines could swing markets up and down over the next several days.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally is trending higher, but leadership is narrow and market breadth suspect. Many of the leading stocks are extended.</p>
      <p>Investors who took advantage of techs clearing buy signals in the past week or so generally have been rewarded, some hugely. But overall exposure should remain modest. Consider taking partial profits on big winners. Definitely have a game plan in place.</p>
      <p>A healthy number of stocks are setting up from a variety of sectors, and could get going if the market rally broadens out. So you'll want to be ready.</p>

      <p>“China-linked stocks like Burberry (BRBY.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) are at the top of the large-cap index following positive price action overnight from the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.</p>
      <p>JD Sports Fashion (JD.L) also moved up the FTSE 100 basket after the retailer said it was on course to make £1bn in annual profit. Halma and ConvaTec were at the bottom of the index in afternoon London trade.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, traders were also watching NatWest (NWG.L) stock as the bank agreed to buy £1.3bn ($1.6bn) of its shares back from the government, which reduces the government's stake to 38.69%.</p>
      <p>“The Treasury is aiming to return NatWest to private ownership by 2025-2026 while attempting to ‘achieve the best value for the taxpayer’. In April, the government’s shareholding stood at 42%, down from a peak of 84%, falling further again this week,” Scholar added.</p>
      <p>Shares in NatWest have struggled this year, caught up in the banking sector turmoil with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the rescue deal for Credit Suisse (CS).</p>
      <p>However, with shares up almost 15% year-on-year to Friday’s close, the government decided it was a good moment to sell some shares, Scholar noted.</p> 
      <p>Meanwhile, Ireland’s low budget airline Ryanair (RYA.IR) has reported a full-year profit of €1.43bn, closing in on its 2018 record of €1.45bn.</p>
      <p>It said it flew 168.6 million passengers, up 74% to an all-time high, breaking its pre-pandemic record of 149 million. The group said it is aiming to get to 225 million passengers by 2026 and also highlighted it wants to be debt free in the next three to four years.</p>
      <p>The airline said it is also expecting a strong summer for bookings but thinks winter could be more challenging with consumer spending under strain.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia markets</h3>
      <p>In the US, two of the three major indices opened in the green as traders waited for a deal to be struck to avert a debt default ahead of the 1 June deadline. President Joe Biden and House Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to hold further talks later following a phone call on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) fell 0.02% to 33,421.12 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.03% to 4,193.22 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) also rose slightly, by 0.06% to 12,664.90.</p>
      <p>Meta (META) was among the biggest gainers, up nearly 3%, despite reports of a £1bn fine from EU data regulators, while shares in US chip giant Micron (MU) were down nearly 4% on the NASDAQ.</p>
      <p>“US-Sino trade tensions are escalating after Beijing banned Micron Technologies from selling semiconductors to key industries in China, a move strongly opposed by Washington,” Scholar said.</p>
      <p>In Asia, markets rose. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) went up 0.90% to 31,086.82 points, lifting stocks to the highest level since the 1990s, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.54% to 19,750.18. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was also in the green, up 0.36% to 3,294.92 points.</p>
      <p>The People’s Bank of China kept its loan prime rate unchanged for a ninth consecutive month in May.</p>
      <p>“Central bank policymakers clearly judged that loosening monetary policy would exacerbate the yuan’s weakness and interest rate differentials, despite China’s shaky path to recovery out of the pandemic,” Scholar added.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) declined against the US dollar by 0.09% to 1.24.</p>
      <p>Against the euro, sterling (GBPEUR=X) was also down, by 0.09% to 1.15.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>In commodities, US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), fell 1.22% to $70.68 per barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) dropped 0.78% to $74.99 per barrel.</p>
      <h3>Economic data</h3>
      <p>Investors will also be looking for some clarity on the future outlook of US interest rate policy when the latest US Federal Minutes from the May meeting are released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Any comments indicating that the Fed is either concerned about the aggressive pace of US interest rate increases impacting the United States economy over the longer-term or confirmation that no more US interest rate hikes are likely can lead to a pause in the recent USD revival,” Jameel Ahmad, chief analyst at CompareBroker.io, said.</p>
      <p>The latest US consumer spending data, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is also set to be released this week — another gauge for inflation pressures.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks opened higher, extending rallies on Wall Street fuelled by optimism over talks to avert a catastrophic US debt default.</p>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 0.39% to 7,883 points at the open, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.22% to 7,560 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 0.10% to 15,866.</p>	
    	<p>The FTSE 100 rose as data showed British consumer confidence hit a 15-month high, adding to the optimism that a deal over the US debt ceiling was imminent.</p>	
    	<p>Traders will be keeping an eye on the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, which starts on Friday, where world leaders are expected to discuss international trade and security. China and Russia relations and sanctions are on the agenda for discussions between Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States.</p>
      <h3>FTSE</h3>
      <p>London stocks edged higher in early trade on Friday following a positive close on Wall Street, amid hopes a deal will be reached to avert a US debt default and improved consumer confidence.</p>
      <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: "Growing optimism for a resolution to the debt ceiling negotiations lifted sentiment, although the mood was slightly tempered by question marks over the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.</p>
      <p>"The mood music from the politicians involved in brokering a deal to raise the debt ceiling and avoid an unthinkable US default was more positive, with investors reacting with cautious optimism until such time as a deal is finalised."</p>
      <p>Miners led the gains across the UK's blue chip index, with Anglo American (AAL.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Glencore (GLEN.L) and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) all up.</p>
      <p>Smiths Group (SMIN.L) rallied as it lifted revenue guidance after a strong third quarter, driven by volume and price growth. Organic revenue was up 13.4% for the nine months to 30 April, leading Smiths to increase 2023 guidance to around 10% organic revenue growth with "moderate" margin improvement.</p>
      <p>BT Group (BT-A.L) steadied at 140p after Thursday’s results-day hammering, while Burberry (BRBY.L) slipped 2.51%.</p>
      <p>Also driving sentiments across the markets was data suggesting that consumer confidence in the year ahead is continuing to recover despite persistent cost of living pressures.</p>
      <p>GfK’s Consumer Confidence Index rose by three points in May to minus 27, the fourth monthly increase in a row from January’s minus 45.</p>
      <p>Confidence in personal finances over the coming 12 months saw a “robust” five-point jump to minus 8 — 17 points higher than this time last year.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were mixed as trading began in Europe.</p>
      <p>Wall Street closed higher on Thursday as investors await updates to the ongoing debt ceiling debate and quarterly results from Walmart (WMT) flashed resilience from the American consumer.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.34% to close at 33,535 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.94% to 4,198 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) jumped 1.51% to 12,688.</p>
      <p>“We are starting to see enough common themes in their views to feel confident that a deal is going to be announced in relatively short order,” Jefferies US economist Thomas Simmons wrote in a note.</p>
      <p>“Given the 1 June X-date warnings from Treasury and the time it takes for the legislative process to play out, we could see an announcement of a framework as soon as Sunday when Biden returns from his trip to Japan for the G-7 meetings.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) stock rose more than 1% as America's largest big box retailer reported higher same-store sales growth than Wall Street had anticipated. Walmart also boosted its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast from a range of $5.90-$6.05 to a range of $6.10-$6.20.</p>
      <p>In Asia, shares nudged lower, weighed down by China and Hong Kong stocks due to concerns over the stuttering recovery in the world's second-biggest economy, although Japan's Nikkei clocked a near 33-year peak.</p>
      <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.77% to 30,808 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong lost 1.31% to 19,468. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) slipped 0.41% to 3,283 points.</p>
      <p>So far this year, the Nikkei has gained around 19%, outpacing other major markets. But despite the recent rally, the Nikkei is still below its all-time peak over 36,000 set in 1989.</p>
      <p>Japan’s core inflation nationwide rose 3.4% year-on-year in April, in line with forecasts by economists polled by Reuters.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) has not managed to pounce on US debt ceiling optimism as with many G10 currencies as investors remain in the cautious’ camp, with sterling trading at $1.2414.</p>
      <p>Sterling (GBPEUR=X) was muted against the euro, trading at €1.1512.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) gained ground and was trading at around $76 per barrel with oil prices set to record their first weekly gain since mid-April as sentiment about future demand improves amid signs there may be progress on the debt ceiling negotiations in Congress.</p>
      <p>“I think markets have been pricing out the risks of a US debt default, which translates to a more risk-on environment and some dip-buying in Brent crude from previous oversold conditions,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG.</p>

    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared early losses, rising 0.3% at closing bell. The index built support at the 50-day moving average, but health leaders in the Dow lagged.</p>
    	<p>On Thursday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he sees the path to "come to an agreement" on the debt ceiling. Experts have stated that the U.S. could default as early as June 1 without a budget agreement. McCarthy sees the vote taking place as early as next week.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 eyed February's high of 4195 as it rose 1%. The Nasdaq gained 1.5% and hit a high for the year to date. NYSE and Nasdaq volume rose vs. Wednesday, according to preliminary data. The small-cap Russell 2000 index gained 0.6%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil continued its fall and traded at $72 per barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6 basis points to 3.64%.</p>	
      <p>Tech leaders Nvidia (NVDA), Lam Research (LRCX), Cadence (CDNS) and ASML (ASML) rose. Nvidia and ASML are IBD Leaderboard stocks, while Lam and Cadence are IBD SwingTrader names.</p>
      <p>Fed officials weighed in on a possible rate hike in June.</p>
      <p>Dallas Fed President Lori Logan said she does not find enough data to warrant pausing hikes yet. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester maintained her stance that the economy is not at a point where holding rates steady would be justified.</p>
      <p>The CME FedWatch Tool sees a 40.2% chance of a 25-basis-point hike in June, taking the effective rate to 5.25%-5.5%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders In Focus</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones component Walmart (WMT) rose after same-store sales growth beat expectations and the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. Shares are in a buy zone that goes up to 155.75, according to IBD MarketSmith.</p>
      <p>Tech leader Cisco Systems (CSCO) pared early losses and gained over 1% into the close after strong earnings. Weaker orders in the fiscal third quarter raised concerns. Shares cleared the 200-day moving average late Thursday.</p>
      <p>Outside the Dow Jones, Alibaba (BABA) fell below converged 50- and 200-day lines after earnings disappointed. The Chinese e-commerce platform approved a spinoff of its cloud segment, Cloud Intelligence Group, through a stock dividend distribution to shareholders. Public listings of its logistics and retail operations are also pending.</p>
      <p>Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) broke out at 137.53 after earnings. The video game publisher sees strong growth, with net bookings hitting $8 billion in fiscal 2025.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Global stocks traded mixed Wednesday as investors mulled U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and wider economic growth worries.</p>
    	<p>It was a different story in Japan, where economic data proved to be the final catalysts that pushed Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 above 30,000 for the first time since September 2021, with the index closing up 0.8% at its highest level in 33 years.</p>	
    	<p>Data showed that the Japanese economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), grew 1.6% in the first quarter of 2023 on an annualized basis, beating expectations of 1.1% growth and marking the first increase in three quarters.</p>	
    	<p>“The Nikkei wasn’t blown off course by American worries, with investors gaining a big spring in their step,” said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. “The economy has bounced back from pandemic woes … as consumers freed from restrictions splashed the cash and tourists returned.”</p>
      <p>It was a cloudier picture across global stocks more broadly, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sagging 2.1% and the Shanghai Composite losing 0.2%. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 was trading just above flat, with the Paris CAC 40 slipping 0.1% into the red and Frankfurt’s DAX gaining 0.3%.</p>
      <p>Investors have continued to monitor the state of talks over the looming U.S. debt ceiling, which has ramifications for worldwide markets. Global growth concerns also continued to simmer in the background, with data out of China over the past two weeks showing a weakening domestic picture in the world’s second-largest economy and signs of slowing global demand for goods.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Losses grew in late trading for the Dow Jones Industrial Average as component Home Depot (HD) disappointed investors with its latest report. Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought shares in a financial stock despite the banking crisis. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blasted President Joe Biden ahead of their debt ceiling meeting.</p>
    	<p>Some stocks tried to break out despite the mixed action. Rambus (RMBS), GMS (GMS) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all tested entries.</p>	
	    <p>Treasury yields moved higher. The 10-year yield rose three basis point to 3.54% while the two-year yield spiked seven basis points to 4.08%, making the yield curve more inverted.</p>
      <h3>Biden Changes Plan After McCarthy Debt Ceiling Jibe</h3>	
	    <p>The long-awaited debt ceiling meeting between congressional leaders and President Joe Biden took place this afternoon.</p>
      <p>McCarthy went on the offensive ahead of the powwow, taking a shot at the president's schedule. Biden is getting set to leave the country on Wednesday for a three-day G-7 meeting in Japan.</p>
      <p>"We've got 16 more days to go," McCarthy told reporters. "I don't think I would spend eight days somewhere out of the country."</p>
      <p>Biden responded by cutting short his overseas engagements. He will now return to the U.S. on Sunday instead of heading to other planned visits to Papua New Guinea and Australia, a source told NBC News.</p>
      <p>Democrats want the debt ceiling raised unconditionally, while Republicans are looking to secure government spending cuts before agreeing. After the meeting McCarthy said there is "a lot of work to do in a short amount of time." He also said they will "work hard to make this come to fruition."</p>
      <p>He also said a member of the Biden administration will be working with a member of his team to hammer out a deal.</p>
      <p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Monday the U.S. could become unable to pay its bills as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn't act.</p>
      <p>Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said the debt ceiling issue is raising anxiety among investors.</p>
      <p>"Wall Street is bracing for something bad to happen, but no one has an idea on what will be that catalyst," he said in a note to clients. "It could be a debt ceiling impasse, persistent banking fears, or a much weaker consumer as sticky inflation becomes more noticeable."</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq Reverses Lower As Small Caps Slump</h3>
      <p>The Nasdaq fared better than the other major indexes but still fell 0.2% as indexes faded in late trading. Baidu (BIDU) impressed with a gain of 4% following its earnings report.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.6%. Caesars Entertainment (CZR) lagged with a dip of 6.9%.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 sectors were mixed with a bias to the negative. Communication services and technology were the top performers. Real estate and energy lagged the most.</p>
      <p>Small caps were mauled by the bears, with the Russell 2000 plunging 1.4%. Growth stocks also lagged, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) losing 1.1%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Home Depot Disappoints, Nike Lags</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones lagged the other major indexes. It ended the day down 336 points, or 1%.</p>
      <p>Home Depot fell 2.1% following its latest quarterly report, though earnings were not actually the issue.</p>
      <p>Home Depot reported a better-than-expected EPS drop of 6.6% to $3.82 as sales fell 4% to $37.26 billion. It was the retailer's worst sales miss in decades.</p>
      <p>The home improvement retailer expects revenue and same-store sales to decrease 2% and 5%, respectively, compared with fiscal 2022. This was worse than its previous guidance.</p>
      <p>Despite this, it was Nike (NKE) that was the worst performer on the Dow Jones today, falling 2.8%.</p>
      <p>Microsoft (MSFT) led the upside as it rose 0.7%. It is currently extended, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
      <h3>Warren Buffett Buys This Finance Stock</h3>
      <p>Many investors like to keep track of 13F filings for stock ideas. And it has emerged that Berkshire Hathaway has taken out a new stake in Capital One Financial (COF).</p>
      <p>Berkshire Hathaway has reported a purchase of over 9.9 million shares in a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>The latest Warren Buffett stock is one of the largest issuers of credit cards in the U.S., and also provides consumer and commercial banking products.</p>
      <p>COF stock closed off highs for the day but still gained 2.1%. Nevertheless, it holds a poor IBD Composite Rating of 32 out of 99.</p>
      <p>In addition to its new holding, Berkshire Hathaway also increased positions in Bank of America (BAC) and Apple (AAPL) by 2% each. It also boosted its Occidental Petroleum (OXY) position by 8%.</p>
      <h3>RH Stock Plummets On Buffett Axing</h3>
      <p>But it was not all good news for stocks following the latest changes to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.</p>
      <p>RH (RH), formerly Restoration Hardware, plunged on news that Buffett dumped the stock in the last quarter. It seems the Oracle of Omaha is not enamored with the luxury furniture retailer's prospects with a possible recession looming.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2022, Berkshire owned 2.36 million shares in the company, which is led by Chairman and CEO Gary Friedman.</p>
      <p>RH stock ended the day down 8.8%. It flashed a sell signal as it plummeted below the 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>The stock holds an RS Rating of 31. It is down a moderate 4.7% so far in 2023.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: AMD Stock Among Breakouts</h3>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices cleared a 102.53 cup-base entry and closed below that level. It is actionable as high as 107.66.</p>
      <p>AMD stock popped after a regulatory filing showed hedge fund Third Point, which is run by activist investor Daniel Loeb, has taken a 1 million-share stake.</p>
      <p>Overall strong performance is reflected in AMD's IBD Composite Rating of 92.</p>
      <p>Rambus saw its relative strength line reach a fresh high after it cleared a buy point of 51.98. RMBS has a perfect Composite Rating of 99. Big Money has also been buying of late, as evidenced by the stock's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating.</p>
      <p>Construction supplies play GMS is just below its 62.29 entry. Institutional ownership is very high: 76% of its stock is owned by funds, according to MarketSmith data.</p>

    	<p>A sizable dip in the innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite is the perfect excuse for investors to pounce on some phenomenal deals.</p>
    	<p>If there's a lesson to be learned from 2022, it's that Wall Street is anything but predictable in the short term. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell into a bear market last year, with the growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -0.35%) performing the worst (a loss of 33%).</p>	
    	<p>The good news is that the stock market becomes quite predictable when you step back and pan out. Despite stock market corrections being somewhat common throughout history, every previous significant downturn in the major U.S. indexes, including the Nasdaq Composite, has eventually been cleared away by a bull market. As long as you're willing to use time as an ally, corrections and bear market dips can be golden opportunities.</p>	
    	<p>With growth stocks getting clobbered in 2022, they're a genius place to consider putting your money to work. What follows are five exceptional growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
      <h3>Pinterest</h3>
      <p>The first incredible growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market drop is social media company Pinterest (PINS -0.37%). Although recessionary fears are currently weighing on Pinterest's ad-driven operating model, this is a company with well-defined competitive edges.</p>
      <p>The first thing you'll note about Pinterest is the company's steady monthly active user (MAU) growth. Though MAUs rose quickly during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and declined into early 2022 as vaccines hit pharmacy shelves, Pinterest's user growth has been relatively steady when examined over a five-year period. User growth isn't everything for social media companies, but it's a number Wall Street and investors are closely monitoring.</p>
      <p>What's arguably even more important is that Pinterest hasn't struggled to monetize its active users. Putting aside the 1% decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) during the first quarter, ARPU jumped by a reasonably healthy 10% in 2022 despite it being a challenging year for advertising. Multiple years of ARPU data has shown that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to get their message in front of Pinterest's growing user base.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Pinterest's operating model ensures it won't be hurt by data-tracking software changes from app developers. Whereas many social media platforms rely on data-tracking tools to help advertisers target users, the entire point of Pinterest's site is for users to willingly and freely share the things, places, and services that interest them. This is invaluable information the company can pass along to advertisers.</p>
      <p>With over $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet and a buyback program in place, Pinterest is ripe for the picking.</p>
      <h3>Exelixis</h3>
      <p>A second jaw-dropping growth stock you'll regret not scooping up with the Nasdaq falling is biotech stock Exelixis (EXEL -0.88%). Though lead drug Cabometyx failed to meet its primary endpoint in combination with Roche's Tecentriq in a recent kidney cancer trial, Exelixis has shown it has an abundance of catalysts for patient investors.</p>
      <p>As you can rightly imagine, Cabometyx is the superstar of this drug portfolio. U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals in first- and second-line renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and advanced previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma are more than enough to generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales.</p>
      <p>Exelixis is also currently examining Cabometyx in around six dozen studies as a monotherapy or combination therapy. While some of these trials won't pan out, as referenced above, a handful will. A previous trial combining Cabometyx with Bristol Myers Squibb's cancer immunotherapy Opdivo led to the combination therapy gaining first-line RCC approval. Just a handful of wins is all it might take for Cabometyx to generate $2 billion or more in peak annual sales.</p>
      <p>Another exciting aspect of Exelixis is that its phenomenal cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet have allowed it to reignite its research engine. The company is developing a handful of novel cancer therapies, as well as forging collaborative/licensing partnerships with other drug developers to expand its future sales channels.</p>
      <p>A sustained double-digit growth rate and a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 20 make Exelixis an attractive buy.</p>
      <h3>Redfin</h3>
      <p>The third exceptional growth stock you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is technology-driven real estate company Redfin (RDFN -4.14%). While anything involving real estate is bound to face challenges in the near term, given that interest rates are rising at their fastest pace in decades, Redfin offers clear advantages over traditional real estate firms.</p>
      <p>The most front-and-center differentiator between Redfin and other real estate companies is cost. Whereas a traditional real estate agent takes between 2% and 3% in commission fees, Redfin charges its members either 1% or 1.5% depending on how much business was previously done with the company. With the average price of homes sold coming in at $516,500 in the first quarter of 2023, this up-to-2-percentage-point difference could save sellers over $10,000!</p>
      <p>Redfin also provides unparalleled personalization in the real estate space. For instance, Redfin's Concierge service works with homeowners to recommend upgrades and with vendors to make those renovations. This service helps owners maximize the sale price of their homes. Although Redfin closed its iBuying program, RedfinNow, it now has more time to focus on these higher-margin personalized services.</p>
      <p>Investors should also be excited about Redfin's acquisition of RentPath in April 2021. While homebuying was all the rage in 2021, renting is regaining its luster as mortgage rates rise. RentPath, the parent company of Rent.com and ApartmentGuides.com, has seen rising revenue early in 2023, according to Redfin.</p>
      <p>After accounting for 0.78% of first-quarter U.S. existing home sales, Redfin has plenty of room for market share expansion.</p>
      <h3>Innovative Industrial Properties</h3>
      <p>A fourth shockingly solid growth stock you'll regret not scooping up on the Nasdaq bear market decline is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR -2.03%), more commonly known as IIP. Though there have been recent concerns about rent delinquencies for IIP, the company appears to be navigating these challenges relatively easily.</p>
      <p>What investors are going to love about IIP is the relative predictability of the business. As of March 31, the company's portfolio consisted of 103 operating properties and an additional five under development. Combined, that's around 8.8 million square feet of rentable space, with a weighted-average lease length of 15.1 years.</p>
      <p>In January and February, there had been some concern with IIP collecting just 92% of its rents on time. But as of March 31, the company announced it had collected 98% of its contractually due base rent for the quarter. Divesting certain assets, reworking master-lease agreements, and possibly even shifting existing leases to new multi-state operators (MSOs) are tools available to IIP to keep its consistent cash flow rolling in.</p>
      <p>The company's lease structure also makes it special. Innovative Industrial Properties' entire portfolio is triple net leased (NNN leased). Triple net leased properties require tenants to cover the cost of utilities, maintenance, taxes, and insurance. While NNN leases result in lower rents for IIP, it also removes any sticker shocks from unexpected costs.</p>
      <p>Sporting a yield of greater than 10%, IIP is an income seeker's dream come true.</p>
      <h3>Baidu</h3>
      <p>The fifth exceptional growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is China-based internet search giant Baidu (BIDU -3.30%). Although China stocks come with added investment risks, Baidu's search engine dominance and innovation easily snuff out these concerns.</p>
      <p>For much of the past three years, Baidu has been held back by China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's zero-COVID mitigation strategy led to stringent lockdowns that continually crippled supply chains. But with China ending this controversial strategy in December, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product is free to, once again, spread its wings. While the rebound could be a bit bumpy, it favors industry-leading growth stocks like Baidu over the long term.</p>
      <p>Baidu's biggest cash-flow generator continues to be its internet search engine. As of April 2023, Baidu accounted for approximately 40% of all internet searches in China, based on data provided by GlobalStats. Doubling up its next-closest competitor in market share makes it likely that Baidu will possess strong ad-pricing power more often than not.</p>
      <p>But there's more to like over the long run than just Baidu's moneymaking search engine. Baidu has invested heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), and those investments are beginning to pay off. The company's AI Cloud and AI-driven autonomous robotaxi company (Apollo Go) helped non-marketing revenue jump 11% in a challenging 2022 for China. Look for Baidu's AI segments to drive its organic growth in the years to come.</p>
      <p>With a number of headwinds now put into the rearview mirror, Baidu looks like a steal at just 11 times consensus earnings for 2024.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down modestly near midday Friday, along with other major stock indexes. Chevron (CVX) was an early leader in the Dow Jones, along with Cisco Systems[ticker symb=CSCO]. But Salesforce (CRM), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Nike (NKE) lagged with losses of at least 1%.</p>
    	<p>The Nasdaq composite also lost ground, dropping around 0.5%.</p>	
    	<p>Small caps outperformed early, lifting the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) to a gain of nearly 0.7%. But the small-cap ETF faded to a loss of around 0.4% at midday. The financial services group, which includes regional banks, is the fourth highest-weighted sector in IWM, at just over 13%.</p>	
    	<p>Meta Platforms (META) was an early gainer but it faded off highs. Late Thursday, the large-cap technology leader released new artificial intelligence tools to help advertisers build ad campaigns.</p>
      <p>In the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) rallied 3% and reversed lower after CEO Elon Musk said a new CEO will take over at Twitter in six weeks. Musk didn't name the person, but CNBC reported that NBCUniversal's advertising chief Linda Yaccarino is in advanced talks for the position. TSLA stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield was up 3 basis points to around 3.43%. After key inflation data this week, federal funds futures traders widely expect the Fed to stand pat at the June and July meetings, leaving the interest rate unchanged at 5% to 5.25%. At the September meeting, traders think there's a 75% chance that the Fed will cut by 25 basis points to 4.75% to 5%.</p>
      <p>Gold edged lower to around $2,015 an ounce. Franco-Nevada (FNV) is holding near its 21-day exponential moving average as it sits just below a 158.98 buy point.</p>
      <h3>Inside the Dow Jones</h3>
      <p>American Express (AXP) was an early gainer in the Dow Jones, but the stock remains on a sharp downtrend. Sellers have hit AXP stock hard after its April 20 earnings report.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan reversed slightly lower, continuing recently-volatile price swings. JPM stock showed bullish action when it rallied above its 50-day line last month. But sellers hit the May 1 gap-up hard, triggering a series of down days.</p>
      <p>Outside the Dow Jones, several growth stocks made solid gains.</p>
      <p>Inside the MarketSmith Growth 250, First Solar (FSLR) soared more than 20% after announcing the acquisition of Europe's Evolar. The small deal, worth up to $80 million, will strengthen First Solar's position in thin film photovoltaics used in solar panels. The buy will also give FSLR its first research and development facility in Europe.</p>
      <p>Other top gainers included TriNet Group (TNET), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Penumbra (PEN) and Insulet (PODD).</p>
      <p>Heavy-volume decliners in the MarketSmith Growth 250 included AngloGold Ashanti (AU), TG Therapeutics (TGTX) and fitness chain Life Time Holdings (LTH).</p>
      <p>Fluence Energy (FLNC) was a top gainer in the IBD 50, but the stock fell off highs. FLNC's weekly gain now stands at 25%. Earlier in the week, the provider of energy storage products reported $698.2 million in revenue, up 104% from a year ago.</p>
      <p>Celsius (CELH) was poised for its eighth straight gain after gapping up on earnings Wednesday. Adjusted profit surged 344%, while its revenue growth rate accelerated from Q4, rising 95% year over year to $259.9 million.</p>
      <p>Chip firm Rambus (RMBS) also gained in the IBD 50. After a bullish accumulation week, Rambus will have a six-week base in place by Friday's close. RMBS stock is less than 5% off its high.</p>

    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed near session highs and bounced off its 50-day moving average on Friday. Apple (AAPL) rose after strong earnings late Thursday along with other blue chip leaders, pushing the index up by over 1.5%.</p>
    	<p>Bank stocks helped lift the S&P 500 — which sank near its 50-day line earlier this week  — by 1.9%. But the tech-dominated Nasdaq was the biggest gainer at the closing bell, rising nearly 2.3%. The Dow climbed 1.7%.</p>	
    	<p>Volume on the NYSE and the Nasdaq was lower compared with the same time on Thursday, which dampened the significance of Friday's rally.</p>	
    	<p>Crude oil rose over 4% to trade at $71.51 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 10 basis points to 3.44%. The energy sector was the best performing in the S&P 500 Friday.</p>
      <p>The small-cap Russell 2000 showed a hefty gain of 2.4% while the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF outperformed, rising over 2.5%.</p>
      <p>The economy added 253,000 jobs in April, much higher than views for 178,000. An unemployment rate of 3.4% in April was lower than estimates of 3.6%, the U.S. Labor Department reported early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Stocks Moving Today</h3>
      <p>Regional banks rose after falling sharply on Thursday. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) rebounded over 80%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) showed a 50% gain at closing time. Zion Bancorp (ZION) also surged and made up all of Thursday's plunge, and more.</p>
      <p>InterDigital (IDCC) broke out of a flat base with a 75.84 entry, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis. The wireless technology company blew past Q1 estimates. Sales grew a whopping 100% while earnings outpaced sales growth with a 325% increase. The relative strength line is also at a new high. The stock is now extended.</p>
      <p>Coinbase (COIN) jumped 18% after earnings came out late Thursday. But the stock has some work to do before it can clear its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Fintech stock Block (SQ) fell 2%, despite strong earnings and outlook thanks to its popular Cash App.</p>
      <p>Carvana (CVNA) surged 25% in strong volume after earnings and cleared its 50-day line after the used car retail chain showed smaller losses than a year ago. Lyft (LYFT) plunged 20%, falling below its 50-day line after earnings were announced and management lowered guidance for the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Strong results sent IBD 50 stock DraftKings (DKNG) surging to a 52-week high Friday. The stock had broken out of a cup base with a buy point of 21.72 ahead of earnings and is now extended.</p>
      <p>Atlassian (TEAM) indicated slowing cloud computing growth despite a strong quarterly report. TEAM fell 10% in heavy volume.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stock In Focus</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones tech leader Apple rose on strong iPhone sales in the first quarter. The tech titan is hitting highs seen last in August 2022.</p>
      <p>Outside Dow Jones, Dynatrace (DT) is building a cup base with a buy point of 48.10 with earnings due on May 17. The recent Stock of the Day and IBD SwingTrader stock cleared a potential early entry at 43.42 as it breaks a trendline.</p>
      <p>Starbucks (SBUX) is rebounding from the 50-day after diving on earnings Wednesday. It is trading below the 110.93 buy point of last week's breakout but may be trying to climb back to it.</p>
      <p>Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will report Q1 earnings and hold a shareholder meeting Saturday as the stock builds a base with a buy point of 362.20.

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>These growth-driven innovators are attractively priced and begging to be bought.</p>
	    <p>Things can change pretty quickly on Wall Street. In 2021, stocks could seemingly do no wrong, with all three major indexes cresting to new highs. In 2022, these same indexes all plunged into respective bear markets, with the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 -- an index comprised of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange -- losing a third of their value.</p>	
	    <p>However, big declines often yield big opportunity for investors. No matter how painful a decline has been for a major stock index throughout history, that loss was eventually (key word!) fully recouped during a bull market. It means the short-term pain the Nasdaq 100 has endured is the ideal time for long-term investors to pounce.</p>	
	    <p>What follows are three Nasdaq 100 stocks that stand out as surefire buys in May.</p>
      <h3>Datadog</h3>
      <p>The first Nasdaq 100 stock that makes for a phenomenal buy in May following a miserable 2022 is cloud-based observability company Datadog (DDOG 14.52%).</p>
      <p>Probably the biggest knock against Datadog is the growing expectation the U.S. economy will fall into a recession in the not-too-distant future. With the Federal Reserve now modeling a "mild recession" into its outlook for later this year, there's the concern that demand for anything involving software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, including monitoring, could taper.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for Datadog, it's benefiting from macro and company-specific catalysts, which should help it successfully navigate a potential economic downturn.</p>
      <p>In terms of the former, the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the labor force. Despite some people returning to the office, more folks than ever are working remotely. This historically large remote workforce has increased the importance of application monitoring in a very short time. Gartner expects Datadog's addressable market for observability will catapult by roughly 50% to $62 billion between 2022 and 2026.</p>
      <p>On a company-specific level, Datadog pointed out in February that its key growth driver is still in its very early stages. Corporate cloud spending as a percentage of global infrastructure technology spend is expected to grow from around 8% in 2021 to an estimated 20% by 2026.  Datadog's observability opportunity is still in its early innings.</p>
      <p>But what's been particularly impressive is Datadog's ability to score big clients. The number of customers generating at least $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) skyrocketed from 11 in 2017 to 317 in 2022. Further, 85% of the company's total ARR now derives from the 12% of customers (approximately 2,780) with at least $100,000 in ARR (note, this write-up was done prior to Datadog's first-quarter earnings release on May 4). Add-on sales from these big fish should help Datadog sustain a sales growth rate of 25%, if not higher.</p>
      <p>Despite a seemingly frothy valuation based on the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, Datadog's price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 1.5 suggests it's an attractive deal.</p>
      <h3>JD.com</h3>
      <p>A second magnificent Nasdaq 100 growth stock that's a surefire buy in May is China-based e-commerce company JD.com (JD 3.17%).</p>
      <p>China stocks have had a rough go in numerous respects since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The zero-COVID mitigation strategy in that country led to three years of stringent, unpredictable lockdowns that hurt supply chains in most sectors and industries. Thankfully, things have changed.</p>
      <p>Following domestic protests, China's regulators ended the controversial zero-COVID strategy in December. Though it could take some time for China's citizens to build up some degree of vaccine-based or natural immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, this was a necessary move by regulators to jump-start the world's No. 2 economy. This removes a big overhang for a growth stalwart like JD.com.</p>
      <p>There's also been some concern about JD getting into a price war with China's other key e-commerce players, such as Alibaba (BABA 1.24%). However, these skeptics are overlooking a sizable difference in the operating models between Alibaba and JD.</p>
      <p>The former generates the majority of its sales from third-party marketplaces, whereas JD predominantly operates as a direct-to-consumer retailer. In other words, it's handling the inventory and logistics necessary for order-to-doorstep delivery. JD's operating model gives it greater control over its expenses than Alibaba, which I expect will lead to better operating margin and a higher sustained organic growth rate.</p>
      <p>JD.com also has an opportunity to unlock shareholder value by following in Alibaba's footsteps and spinning off key assets. In late March, JD announced plans to spin off its property and industrial segments and list them on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Doing so should make future operating results even easier for investors to understand.</p>
      <p>Lastly, JD.com is cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Shares can be purchased for just over 10 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for 2024. Even taking into account the added risks associated with China stocks, JD's superior growth rate makes its stock a steal.</p>
      <h3>PayPal Holdings</h3>
      <p>The third Nasdaq 100 stock that's a surefire buy in May is none other than fintech stock PayPal Holdings (PYPL 0.53%).</p>
      <p>Arguably the biggest issue for PayPal is the historically high inflation consumers and businesses have been dealing with over the past year. Rapidly rising prices for goods and services threatens to reduce the purchasing power of low-earning workers. It could also lower the number of transactions completed on PayPal or Venmo, the company's two core digital transaction networks.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, though, PayPal has struggled far less than you'd imagine. Total payment volume (TPV) reached $1.36 trillion in 2022, which represents a 13% increase from the prior-year period, excluding currency movements. Keep in mind that this 13% growth rate occurred with inflation at a four-decade high and U.S. gross domestic product shrinking in the first half of 2022. It's a testament to the growth potential of digital transactions and suggests a return to 20%-plus annual TPV growth is possible once the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders again.</p>
      <p>But as I've previously pointed out, PayPal's greatest strength is its user engagement. At the end of 2020, active accounts were completing an average of 40.9 transactions over the trailing-12-month (ttm) period. That compares to the 51.4 average transactions per active account over the ttm at the end of 2022. Since PayPal is primarily a fee-driven business, more transactions will almost certainly mean higher gross profit for the company.</p>
      <p>Although PayPal is a growth company, CEO Dan Schulman isn't oblivious to his company's near-term challenges. That's why Schulman outlined plans to reduce annual expenditures by at least $1.3 billion in 2023. Further, PayPal's board approved buying back up to $15 billion worth of common stock. Fewer shares outstanding should result in a boost to earnings per share, which would make PayPal's stock appear even more attractive.</p>
      <p>Like JD.com, PayPal is as cheap as it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Investors can scoop up shares right now for 13 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for 2024. For context, PayPal has averaged a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 over the past five years. This makes it nothing short of a screaming bargain.</p>

      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.64% to 7,751.70. The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.56% to 7,381.68 points – and in Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) went up 0.66% to 15,837.98.</p>	
    	<p>“After slumping to a one-month low on Thursday, the FTSE 100 is trading higher lifted by British Airways’ parent company IAG which has taken to the skies following first quarter earnings,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.</p>
      <p>BP was also at the top of the FTSE 100 basket after the energy giant reported a first-quarter profit of $4.96bn this week, which beat analysts’ expectations of $4.3bn.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia markets</h3>
      <p>In Asia, the major markets were mixed overnight with mainland Chinese markets slipping after a weak Caixin services PMI reading for April.</p>
      <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.12% to 29,157.95 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong rose 0.49% to 20,046.91. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was in the red, down 0.61% to 3,329.51 points.</p>
      <p>In the US, all three indexes closed the session lower as investors fretted over more turmoil ahead in the banking sector – and digested the impact of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates again.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) dropped 0.86% to 33,127.74 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.72% to 4,061.22 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) also declined - by 0.49% to 11,966.40.</p>
      <p>Shares of PacWest (PACW) dropped 50%, while Western Alliance (WAL) stock dropped nearly 40% after the lender denied that executives are exploring a possible sale.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) gained against the US dollar by 0.50% to 1.26 as traders opted for the currency amid fresh concern in the US banking sector. Against the euro, the sterling (GBPEUR=X) also rose, by 0.18% to 1.14.</p>
      <h3>Oil prices</h3>
      <p>In commodities, crude prices edged higher on Friday after losing ground this week.</p>
      <p>US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), rose 1.14% to $69.34 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) gained 1.19% to $73.36 a barrel.</p>
      <p>“However, oil is still on track for its third week of losses reflecting uncertainty about the global economic outlook and the threat of weaker demand, particularly from China,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.</p>
      <h3>Economic data</h3>
      <p>The monthly US employment report, or non-farm payrolls, is due out later showing how many jobs the country’s economy created in April.</p>
      <p>“Expectations for a strong headline number have risen following the ADP employment report on Wednesday indicating that 296,000 jobs were added to the private sector last month. This has encouraged optimism that the monthly employment report might even show that more than 300,000 jobs were added to the US economy in April,” Jameel Ahmad, chief analyst at CompareBroker.io, said.</p>
      <p>Ahmad also noted that global markets could decline, even if the latest employment report presents a blockbuster number, as a resilient jobs report validates the narrative of the Federal Reserve to continue not giving too much away when it comes to the future monetary policy outlook.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, investors were also taking in the latest activity data in Britain's construction sector, which increased in April.</p>
      <p>The S&P Global/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers' Index for the construction industry came in at 51.1 in April, up from 50.7 in March.</p>
      <p>However, growth was lopsided as residential house-building suffered its steepest decline since May 2020 as a result of weaker demand and higher mortgage rates.</p>
      <p>Also on Friday, the European Central Bank released its quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters, a key input in policy deliberations.</p>
      <p>It revealed the ECB now sees 2023 inflation at 5.6%, down from the 5.9% expected three months ago, while the 2024 projection was cut to 2.6% from 2.7%.</p>
      <p>The 2025 figure was lifted to 2.2% from 2.1% and the "longer term" figure, which refers to 2027, was kept at 2.1%.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, retail sales in the eurozone have also been released by Eurostat.</p>
      <p>The data showed retail sales volumes in the 20 nations sharing the euro currency fell by 1.2% in March from the previous month, outpacing the 0.1% drop seen in a Reuters poll of economists.</p>
      <h3>Adidas earnings</h3>
      <p>The sports retail giant reported first quarter sales of €5.27bn on Friday, beating analysts’ expectations. Adidas (ADS.DE) put it down to strong demand for the Terrace shoe as well as the Samba and Gazelle.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, its operating profit hit €60m, quadrupling consensus forecasts for €15m. However, it reported a net loss from continuing operations of €24m – and gross margins declined.</p>
      <p>“There appears to be green shoots of optimism for the sportswear giant which is still reeling from the Yeezy / Kanye West crisis after its partnership with Ye ended last year. This resulted in a €400m dash to sales, hitting North America hardest and leaving Adidas with a huge pile of unsold shoe inventory,” Scholar commented.</p>
      <p>Adidas also said it has been struggling with cost inflation and the softening consumer backdrop, which has led to greater discounting.</p>
      <p>“Although shares fell sharply in October after its Yeezy deal terminated, shares have been rebounding over the last six months. Investors are also optimistic about new CEO Bjørn Gulden thanks to his impressive CV including his recent nine-year term at Puma at which he helped spearhead the brand’s revival,” Scholar added.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 index today regained lost ground during a busy session for blue-chip updates.</p>
    	<p>Alongside the latest developments at Lloyds Banking Group, Flutter Entertainment and Barratt Developments, markets have reacted to the FCA’s decision last night to reform listing rules in order to make it easier for companies to list in London.</p>	
    	<p>In the US, meanwhile, investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision amid hopes that tonight’s quarter point increase will be the last in the cycle.</p>	
    	<h3>FTSE 100 Live Wednesday</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal Reserve to hike rates again</li>
        <li>Lloyds profit ahead of hopes at £2.3bn</li>
        <li>Barratt Developments sees signs of recovery</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Price of fish and chips jumps a fifth</h3>
      <p>12:24 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>The cost of fish and chips has shot up by almost a fifth and the price of children’s clothes has rocketed, according to a new interactive tool showing Britons how much their shopping bills have surged over the past year.</p>
      <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has launched a comparison tool to show how much everyday items have increased during the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
      <h3>Sharp fall in oil prices</h3>
      <p>11:54 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Oil prices plunged toward $70 a barrell, hitting the share prices of London’s supermajors.</p>
      <p>Brent Crude fell by 2.4% to $71.82, the lowest since March, amid wider concerns about the economy.</p>
      <p>“Oil prices have been crushed again over the last 24 hours as US regional bank shares sold off heavily and fuelled fears of a more significant economic downturn this year,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the UK and EMEA at OANDA, said.</p>
      <p>He added that he believed the decline should be a warning to the Federal Reserve to pause its rate hikes: “The warning signs are there that investors are extremely anxious about the global economic prospects, particularly the US, and the data is slowly catching up which should deter the Fed from hiking today but it in all likelihood won't.”</p>
      <h3>Lloyds beats profit forecasts as lenders now look toward BOE rate hike</h3>
      <p>11:39 , Michael Hunter</p>
      <p>Lloyds Banking Group became the latest big-name high street lender to beat profit forecasts today, in the finale of a strong reporting season for UK financial companies, which have shrugged off the crisis seen in the sector in the US and Europe.</p>
      <p>The country’s biggest single mortgage lender, which has 26 million customers in total, reported profit before tax of £2.3 billon for the first quarter, up from £1.5 billion in the same period a year ago. It was higher than the £1.95 billion forecast by City experts.</p>
      <h3>Card Factory sales boosted as shoppers embrace High Street</h3>
      <p>10:50 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Card Factory has recorded a 27.1% full-year sales jump, with physical shops performing better than online for the retailer.</p>
      <p>The company saw annual revenue reach £463.4 million in the year to January 31. Comparable sales growth was 6.7%.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Darcy Willson-Rymer said: “These strong results reflect positive momentum across the business, including notable progress on our strategic growth initiatives, buoyed by the marked shift of customer spend back towards the high street.”</p>
      <h3>BP down again but FTSE 100 higher, Pearson rebounds 6%</h3>
      <p>10:24 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>Lufthansa’s forecast of a summer “travel boom” failed to lift airline stocks today as investors focused on the outlook for cargo earnings.</p>
      <p>Shares in IAG, which trades as British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, faded 3% or 4.55p to 147.5p despite Lufthansa reporting a 73% jump in passenger revenues as demand returns to above pre-pandemic levels on short and medium haul leisure routes.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Carsten Spohr added: “After a good first quarter in which we were able to significantly improve our result, we now expect a travel boom in the summer as well as a new record in our traffic revenue for the year as a whole.”</p>
      <p>In contrast to passenger routes, Lufthansa said cargo earnings fell sharply as air freight rates stabilised after their boost from Covid supply chain disruption. Lufthansa shares dropped 5%, offsetting an otherwise positive session for European markets.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 index put back some of Tuesday’s 1% loss by adding 24.23 points to 7,797.26, helped by a rise of 6% or 49p to 803p for education publisher Pearson.</p>
      <p>The recovery from yesterday’s 14.5% slide came as Deutsche Bank reiterated a 1140p target price and said there was limited read-across to Monday’s warning by US-based Chegg over the impact of AI chatbots on its homework-help services.</p>
      <p>There was no such bounceback for BP as shares fell another 6.9p to 481.45p, adding to yesterday’s 8% slide when concerns over the outlook trumped forecast-beating profits.</p>
      <p>It was a similar story for Sensodyne-to-Panadol consumer health firm Haleon after it posted revenues growth of 13.7%. The performance was overshadowed by Pfizer’s plans to sell down its 32% stake, causing Haleon to fall 4% or 13.3p to 339.7p.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 250 index improved 65.12 points to 19,379.35, led by TI Fluid Systems as a surge in vehicle production boosted first quarter revenues. The shares jumped 15% or 16.2p to 124.2p.</p>
      <h3>Nisa announces plans to open another 400 shops</h3>
      <p>10:11 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Nisa has announced plans to open a further 400 shops this year as part of a continuing recruitment drive.</p>
      <p>The group has already opened 130 new stores this year and increased links with wholesale partners, including Greens Retail and MPK.</p>
      <p>Some 473 new shops were opened last year.</p>
      <h3>RS Group CFO quits amid ‘relationship with colleague’</h3>
      <p>09:38 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>The CFO of electrical parts distributor RS Group quit with immediate effect today after admitting to a “personal relationship with a colleague”.</p>
      <p>David Egan said he would resign as “there have been some shortcomings of judgment” and his actions have “fallen short of the high standards expected of RS leadership”.</p>
      <p>RS chair Rona Fairhead said: “Following a thorough review, the board has accepted David’s resignation and in stepping down he recognises the importance of leaders setting and abiding by exemplary standards”.</p>
      <p>Fairhead also praised Egan’s work in “driving transformation” as CFO. Egan became CFO in 2016 with RS Group’s shares below 250p and left with them at 913p.</p>
      <p>Today, shares are down 2.6% to 889.4p.</p>
      <p>Egan made £1.8 million last year. He was set to earn up to £8.4 million this year, depending on performance.</p>
      <h3>British Land secures planning consent for urban logistics hub serving central London</h3>
      <p>09:36 , Joanna Bourke</p>
      <p>Paddington is set to get a new ultra-low carbon logistics development that could help satisfy post-pandemic demand for very speedy deliveries, after property giant British Land got the green light for its first “microhub”.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 developer has secured planning permission for a 121,000 square feet scheme called ‘The Box’ underneath its 5 Kingdom Street office tower. Construction is expected to complete by 2026.</p>
      <p>Flutter UK revenue soars as sector braces for safer gambling reforms</p>
      <p>08:32 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Sky Bet and Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment saw UK revenue grow 17% in the final quarter before the Government announced safer gambling reforms that could cost the business £100 million a year.</p>
      <p>However, CEO Peter Jackson said that the reforms in question couldn’t yet be implemented in the way the Government has proposed without changes to technology or data rules.</p>
      <p>“It will be very difficult for us to implement these measures now,” he said. “It’s not clear what those will be and there will have to be technical reforms for those to be in place.</p>
      <p>The reform expected to have the largest  impact on revenue is the introduction of new ‘financial risk checks’, where gambling firms must perform ‘passive’ checks for credit black marks like county court judgements on customers depositing more than £125 in a day. Customers depositing £1,000 per day of £2,000 in 90 days will face closer scrutiny, which the Government likened to credit checks for borrowers.</p>
      <p>The Government has put out a consultation on the reforms. Jackson said it remained to be seen how the Government would simultaneously deliver its promises of protecting those at risk and not introducing too much friction for gamblers.</p>
      <p>“That’s the whole point of the consultation,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Pearson leads FTSE 100 recovery, Haleon falls 3%</h3>
      <p>08:31 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 index has recovered some of yesterday’s lost ground after adding 31.06 points to 7804.09 in today’s early dealings.</p>
      <p>Education coursework publisher Pearson led the way, having fallen 14% yesterday after US-based Chegg highlighted the impact of AI chatbots on the growth of its homework-help services.</p>
      <p>Pearson shares rallied 4% or 27.6p to 781.6p as Deutsche Bank analysts reiterated a 1140p target price and said the read-across from Chegg’s warning appeared to be limited.</p>
      <p>There was no such bounceback for BP shares, however, as the oil giant remained close to its opening mark at 488.25p. Concerns over the outlook sent shares more than 8% lower yesterday, even though the heavyweight stock beat expectations with first quarter profits.</p>
      <p>Among the blue-chips reporting today, Lloyds Banking Group edged up 0.2p to 47.88p and Flutter Entertainment improved 10p to 15,800p. Shares in consumer healthcare business Haleon dropped 3% or 11.45p to 341.55p, even though its first quarter results were in line with the guidance given alongside its AGM last month.</p>
      <h3>Barratt Developments points to signs of recovery in UK housing market</h3>
      <p>08:10 , Joanna Bourke</p>
      <p>Barratt Developments today said sales have picked up and it will meet City profit expectations, with the UK’s largest housebuilder adding to signs of a recovery in the residential market.</p>
      <p>Like rivals, the FTSE 100 company saw trading impacted after the aftermath of September’s mini Budget sent mortgage bills jumping, and on top of that a cost of living crisis has hit demand.</p>
      <p>In February Barratt reported early signs of recovery in reservation rates, and chief executive David Thomas has now said: “Whilst the economic backdrop remains difficult, we are pleased that more positive sales rates have been maintained through this period and we are now fully forward sold for FY23.”</p>
      <h3>US bank shares hit by more turbulence</h3>
      <p>07:46 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank index fell 4.5% yesterday and is now below where it was at the time of turmoil involving Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse at the end of March. The industry benchmark has lost about a quarter of its value in the year to date.</p>
      <p>With the crisis far from over after the weekend collapse of First Republic and the subsequent purchase of its assets by JP Morgan Chase, shares in US regional banks dropped sharply yesterday before steadying later in the session.</p>
      <p>PacWest Bancorp still ended the day 28% lower and Metropolitan Bank down by more than 20%, while heavyweight stocks also came under pressure as Citigroup and Bank of America both lost around 3% of their value.</p>
      <p>Concerns over the US debt ceiling have added to the jitters after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government could run out of money within a month unless Congress agrees to lift the statutory borrowing limit.</p>
      <h3>Aston Martin sales accelerate but net debt goes up a gear too</h3>
      <p>07:37 , Simon Hunt</p>
      <p>Aston Martin Lagonda posted a 27% jump in sales to just under £300 million for the first quarter of 2023 but saw its net debt increase by more than £100 million on the previous quarter to £868 million.</p>
      <p>The supercar maker said its DBS 770 Ultimate, the most powerful production Aston Martin ever, was unveiled in January 2023, with all 499 examples having already sold out.</p>
      <p>Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, boss of Aston Martin, said: “Since the start of the year, we have continued to see strong demand across our product range, with our current range of sports cars essentially sold out for the year.</p>
      <p>“The DBX707, the first car developed under my leadership, continues to receive broad media acclaim and, with a growing number incredibly satisfied customers, is strengthening the DBX orderbook in our all major markets, as well as our overall financial performance.”</p>
      <h3>Metro Bank reports first unadjusted profit</h3>
      <p>07:28 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>In a quarter marked by banking turmoil, Metro Bank reported an unadjusted profit for the first time.</p>
      <p>The high street bank founded in 2010 reported an underlying profit in the final quarter of last year, but achieved profit on a statutory basis for the first time in Q1 as new current account openings rose by 18%.</p>
      <p>“Metro Bank has delivered a second consecutive quarter of underlying profitability and March has been our strongest month of performance since the turnaround commenced,” Boss Daniel Frumkin said. “We continued to attract more personal and business accounts, demonstrating the strong appeal of our service-led, community-based model.</p>
      <p>“Whilst we remain watchful of macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to optimise the business for improved risk-adjusted returns and are confident in our plan to become a sustainably profitable growth engine.”</p>
      <h3>Lloyds profit hits £2.3 billion in the first quarter beating City forecasts</h3>
      <p>07:25 , Michael Hunter</p>
      <p>Lloyds Banking Group has reported profit before tax of £2.3 billon for the first quarter, up from £1.5 billion in the same period a year ago.</p>
      <p>That was higher than the £1.95 billion forecast by City experts.</p>
      <p>Loans and advances to customers dropped by £2.6 billion to £452.3 billion. Customers pulled £2.2 billion out of accounts in the period, taking them to £473.1 billion. Retail current account balances dropped by £3.5 billion, partly due to “seasonal outflows” including tax bills due in January. Commercial banking deposits rose £2.7 billion, offsetting the decline in retail accounts.</p>
      <p>Its forecast-beating profits, from a period where the global banking sector was hit by crisis, were another sign that the turbulence from the collapse of Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank in the US left the UK sector untouched.</p>
      <p>Charlie Nunn, Lloyds chief executive, called the performance “solid”, but added: “The macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain. We know that this is challenging for many people. Our purpose driven strategy, alongside our financial strength, means we can continue to support our customers across the country.”</p>
      <p>The update from the high street lender brings the curtain down on reporting season for banks.</p>
      <h3>US shares under pressure, FTSE 100 steadies</h3>
      <p>07:20 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>US stock markets were sharply lower last night amid ongoing concerns over the health of the country’s regional banking sector.</p>
      <p>The prospect of tonight’s Federal Reserve interest rates decision and press conference also kept investors on the sidelines as the S&P 500 index fell 1.2%.</p>
      <p>The selling hit almost all sectors, with financial stocks among the worst affected after the collapse of First Republic and subsequent takeover by JP Morgan Chase.</p>
      <p>The impact of rising interest rates on financial stability will remain in focus today as US policymakers are widely expected to announce another quarter point hike in borrowing costs.</p>
      <p>However, traders will also be looking for any indication from Fed chairman Jerome Powell that a funds range of 5%-5.25% represents the peak of the cycle.</p>
      <p>The US jitters impacted trading in London yesterday, leaving the FTSE 100 index down by more than 1%. CMC Markets expects a calmer session this morning and is forecasting a rise of 25 points to 7798 at the opening bell.</p>
      <p>Recap: Yesterday’s top stories</p>
      <p>06:53 , Simon Hunt</p>
      <p>Good morning. Here’s a summary of our top stories from yesterday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled a fresh set of reforms to London’s listing rules to make it a more attractive destination for a wider range of businesses.</li>
        <li>The boss of HSBC laid out a fresh vision for Silicon Valley Bank UK, which it bought for £1 in March, after it posted a surge in profits.</li>
        <li>BP unveiled blockbuster profits but said it was not on course to beat last year’s earnings record.</li>
        <li>Shareholders in Ocado have revolted against huge pay awards for its senior management.</li>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Global stock markets mostly rose Friday following modestly positive economic data in Europe and the United States, while the yen tumbled after the Bank of Japan maintained its easing policies.</p>
    	<p>European equities ended the session in positive territory after a morning in the red, shrugging off official data confirming that the eurozone economy only just eked out growth in the first three months of the year.</p>	
    	<p>Wall Street followed a similar pattern, getting past early weakness to push higher for a second straight day.</p>	
      <p>"It's a little bit of a relief trade," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that investors remain "a little guarded."</p>
      <p>The week's economic data was "okay," said O'Hare, who noted that earnings from influential technology US companies largely met expectations and in some cases exceeded them.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve's favored measure, the annual personal consumption expenditures price index, eased to 4.2 percent in March from a revised 5.1 percent a month earlier, with a sharp decline recorded in energy prices, according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>
      <p>"Today's PCE data was pretty much as expected but is trending in a good direction for those hoping for inflation to moderate," analysts for Charles Schwab said in a note.</p>
      <p>Most analysts expect the Fed to again lift interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday in response to inflation.</p>
      <p>The United States on Thursday revealed that the economy had slowed more than expected in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>Hard on its heels were Friday's official data showing the eurozone economy expanded just 0.1 percent in the first quarter over the previous three months, as high inflation and interest rates weigh on activity.</p>
      <p>"The very small increase in (eurozone) GDP... means a technical recession has been avoided by a whisker," noted Capital Economics' chief Europe economist Andrew Kenningham.</p>
      <p>"However, the economy has essentially stalled as domestic demand has been hit hard by the energy shock followed by monetary tightening."</p>
      <p>Germany, the EU's biggest economy, saw growth stagnate at zero percent over the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>The yen, meanwhile, fell sharply after the Bank of Japan announced a review of its longstanding monetary easing measures, but said it would maintain them for the time being in the first policy decision under new governor Kazuo Ueda.</p>
      <p>Ueda has previously called the BoJ's current stance "appropriate" and warned of the risk of sudden moves, given global economic uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas, predicted that the central bank could drop its negative interest-rate policy towards the end of 2024 or later, when the global economy is expected to see clear recovery.</p>
      <p>"Because long-term yields are stable globally, the BoJ under Ueda does not have to rush to make policy adjustments," he said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed higher Friday as a pair of closely watched inflation gauges were released. Amazon.com (AMZN) stock sold off after its Q1 earnings, while First Solar (FSLR) plunged on an earnings miss.</p>
    	<p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index matched expectations, rising 0.1% for the month of March, with an annual increase of 4.2%, which also met estimates. The Core PCE price index climbed 0.3% on the month, with an annual increase of 4.6%. The monthly rate matched Wall Street's estimates, while the annual increase came in slightly higher than expected.</p>	
    	<p>Personal income climbed 0.3%, more than the expected 0.2% rise for March. The Federal Reserve will be particularly focused on prices for nonhousing services, which have remained firm as food and energy prices have eased.</p>	
    	<p>Further, the Employment Cost Index, the Fed's preferred measure of wage growth, rose 1.2%, slightly higher than estimates. Seen as a key to services inflation, the hope is it will show that wage growth easing to the 3.5% annual rate that the Fed sees as consistent with its inflation target.</p>
      <h3>Earnings Movers: Amazon, First Solar</h3>
      <p>Amazon stock lost 5% Friday morning after the e-commerce giant reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street targets amid cost-cutting. Management's earnings call commentary raised questions over how long a slowdown in cloud computing growth will persist.</p>
      <p>Other key earnings movers include Chevron (CVX), Cloudflare (NET), First Solar (FSLR), Intel (INTC) and Snap (SNAP).</p>
      <p>Dow Jones energy giant Chevron fell 1% despite beating Q1 earnings and sales targets.</p>
      <p>Cloudflare reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates while revenue roughly met expectations. But Cloudflare stock plunged 25% early Friday on a weak June-quarter and full-year 2023 revenue outlook.</p>
      <p>First Solar badly missed expectations for the first quarter. FSLR stock dived 12% in early trade.</p>
      <p>Chipmaker Intel beat Wall Street's targets for the first quarter but offered a mixed outlook for the second quarter. Intel stock jumped 7.7% in morning trade.</p>
      <p>Finally, Snapchat parent Snap tumbled 18% after missing revenue targets.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) traded down 1% Friday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were mixed after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>InMode (INMD), IBD Leaderboard stock Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Paccar (PCAR) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Nike (NKE) and Visa (V) — are among the top stocks to watch in the now-struggling stock market.</p>
      <p>Nike was featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. InMode was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day. Paccar received an IBD Stock Analysis close up on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, and the S&P 500 edged higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) moved down 0.1%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) traded up 0.1% early Friday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Friday traded down to 3.44%. The 10-year yield is set for solid losses this week, on pace to end a two-week rebound though it is still squarely off its early-April lows.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil prices moved modestly higher Friday morning, but remained down a bit more than 3% for the week. West Texas Intermediate futures are just above $75 a barrel, after pulling back from an April 12 high above $83 a barrel and trading near what has been a mean level of support since December.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally Struggles</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.6% and the S&P 500 advanced 2% Thursday. Both ended two-day skids and found support around their 50-day lines. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.4%, closing at its highest level since April 19. Again, the small-cap Russell 2000 was the laggard, climbing 1.2%, just off its late-March lows.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "Despite Thursday's big gain, the stock market outlook remains in an 'uptrend under pressure.' IBD recommends an exposure level 20% to 40% due to the volatile daily market action. Weak breadth is another concern lately."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column with the stock market now struggling to maintain its uptrend.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: JPMorgan, Nike, Visa</h3>
      <p>JPMorgan shares rose more than 1.3% Thursday, finding support around their 50-day line. Shares are tracing a cup-with-handle buy point at 141.88, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. JPM stock fell 0.6% early Friday.</p>
      <p>Nike shares rebounded 1.5% Thursday, holding above their 50-day line and about 2% away from a cup-with-handle's 127.59 buy point. NKE stock moved down 0.4% in early trade.</p>
      <p>Visa shares are still below a 230.15 cup-with-handle buy point; they rose 0.4% Thursday. And V stock dropped around 0.4% in early morning trade.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: InMode, Paccar</h3>
      <p>InMode finished Thursday just shy of a cup-with-handle's 38.48 buy point, with a 0.1% loss, according to IBD MarketSmith. INMD stock rose 0.7% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: The company makes noninvasive platforms that tighten skin and obliterate fat cells. It's also moving into the women's health realm with gynecological offerings. UBS analyst Danielle Antalffy says InMode provides a lower-cost alternative to traditional plastic surgery.</p>
      <p>Paccar is trying to find support around its 50-day line, as it continues to build a flat base with a 76.82 buy point. An early entry at 75.83 is also in play. PCAR stock was unchanged Friday.</p>
      <p>Backstory: The producer of heavy-duty semi-trucks topped Q1 estimates on Tuesday, reporting a 96% earnings spike. At CES 2022, Paccar exhibited connected and autonomous trucks. The company behind the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates showcased three vehicles.</p>
      <h3>Las Vegas Sands, Lululemon</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Las Vegas Sands remains in the 5% buy range above a 60.40 buy point in a cup with handle amid Thursday's 0.7% gain. The buy zone tops out at 63.42. LVS stock was down 0.4% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: Last week, Las Vegas Sands smashed earnings expectations for the first quarter and signaled a "robust recovery" in China's Macau gaming hub. The casino stock posted earnings of 28 cents per share, up from a loss of 40 cents a year ago. Revenue vaulted nearly 125% to $2.12 billion.</p>
      <p>Lululemon is rebounding from its 371.36 entry in a cup with handle, with a 1.4% rise Thursday. Shares were down 0.3% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: On March 28, Lululemon hiked 2023 guidance after topping earnings and revenue estimates for the holiday fourth quarter, sparking a 12.7% surge on March 29. The yogawear and athleisure apparel retailer's final fourth-quarter results also exceeded its own preliminary announcement, issued in early January.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock bounced 4.2% Thursday, still near its lowest level since late January. In recent weeks, shares triggered the 7%-8% loss rule from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle. And they are trading sharply below their 50-day line. The stock closed Thursday 52% off its 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock threatened to give up Thursday's gains, trading down 1% early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares rallied 2.8% Thursday, closing at their highest level since late August. They remain above a 157.48 buy point and out of the buy range that runs up to 165.35. AAPL stock rose 0.1% early. Apple reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares jumped another 3.2% Thursday, set for weekly gains of nearly 7%. Shares are out of buy range past a flat base's 276.86 buy point. The 5% buy area went up to 290.70. On Friday morning, MSFT stock lost 0.3%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>NatWest’s (NWG.L) pre-tax operating profit rose 49% year on year to £1.8bn ($2.2bn) thanks to higher interest rates but tumbling customer deposits disappointed investors and analysts.</p>
    	<p>The group reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first three months of the year.</p>	
    	<p>NatWest Group, which includes Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank, also saw its total income surge by more than a third over the period, helped by higher interest rates which makes it more expensive to borrow.</p>	
    	<p>Revenue increased by 29% to £3.9bn — just above analysts’ estimates of £3.8bn.</p>
      <p>Natwest shares slid 5.8% on Friday.</p>
      <p>NatWest Group chief executive Alison Rose said: “Through a period of significant disruption and uncertainty, we continue to stand alongside the people, families and businesses we serve, providing targeted support and growing our lending responsibly.</p>
      <p>“Our disciplined and consistent approach to risk management means that arrears and impairments remain low.</p>
      <p>“By monitoring customer behaviour and looking closely for signs of financial distress, we are able to put in place proactive measures to help those who are struggling right now and those who are worried about the future.”</p>
      <p>NatWest and the other high street lenders have been criticised over how slowly they passed on the benefits of higher rates to customers and earning disproportionate profits by increasing rates on mortgages quicker than rates on savings products.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Rose originally refused to attend a parliamentary hearing with the Treasury select committee but U-turned following public pressure.</p>
      <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “Set against the wider banking turmoil of recent months the solid and dependable, if a little unexciting, performance which NatWest has delivered is just what the doctor ordered for more risk-averse investors.”</p>
      <p>Personal current account balances decreased by £2.6bn and personal savings decreased by £1.8bn in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould, said: “A drop in customer deposits, while nothing like on the scale seen at other crisis-ridden banks, has helped put the wind up investors in NatWest.</p>
      <p>“The gap between the amount NatWest charges for loans compared to what it pays out for deposits, also known as the net interest margin, is also tighter than many had hoped.</p>
      <p>“This runs counter to Barclays’ (BARC.L) own first quarter numbers which showed higher base interest rates were feeding into a strong net interest margin.</p>
      <p>“The disappointing news elsewhere overshadowed NatWest’s better than expected earnings for the first quarter — driven by higher non-interest income and lower impairments on bad debts."</p>
      <p>NatWest chair Howard Davies this week said that "poor risk management" was largely behind recent bank failures and that NatWest remains resilient.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures rose slightly Wednesday morning while Nasdaq futures climbed solidly as Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Boeing headlined big earnings.</p>
          <p>The stock market rally fell sharply Tuesday, with investors wary heading into major earnings Tuesday night and beyond. First Republic Bank (FRC) crashed on deposit flight reviving banking fears. FRC stock kept tumbling Wednesday amid desperate attempts to avoid a collapse.</p>	
          <p>Concerns about China growth, exacerbated by reports of a new Covid wave there, also weighed on stocks, as well as Treasury yields and commodity prices on Tuesday. U.S. government default risks are looming over the horizon.</p>	
          <p>Microsoft stock jumped overnight on strong results and guidance, signaling a move back into a buy zone. Visa (V) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also rose. Google stock turned slightly lower early Wednesday. Enphase Energy (ENPH) dived on mixed results and guidance.</p>
        <p>Boeing (BA) rose solidly Wednesday after reporting mixed results before the open.</p>
        <p>Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders.</p>
        <p>The video embedded in this article discussed Tuesday's market action and analyzed Rambus (RMBS), ServiceNow (NOW) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ).</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
        <p>Dow Jones futures were 0.1% above fair value, with Microsoft stock, Boeing and Visa all Dow Jones components. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures popped 0.85%, well off overnight highs.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 3.42%.</p>
        <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
        <h3>Microsoft, Google Earnings</h3>
        <p>Microsoft earnings topped fiscal Q3 views comfortably as Azure cloud-computing growth slowed but was perhaps better than feared. The Dow Jones tech titan also guided slightly higher on Q4 revenue.</p>
        <p>MSFT stock leapt 8% early Wednesday. Shares fell 2.25% to 275.42 in Tuesday's regular session. Microsoft closed back below a 276.86 flat-base buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis, but is signaling a move above that level on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In fact, MSFT stock could clear the April 6 high of 292.08. Investors could view the recent action as a handle to a consolidation going back to August or even late 2021.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a U.K. regulator on Wednesday blocked the Microsoft takeover of video game publisher Activision (ATVI) on competition grounds. The $69 billion Microsoft-Activision deal faces FTC opposition as well. ATVI stock dived in premarket trade.</p>
        <p>Google earnings topped views with the internet giant also authorizing up to $70 billion in share buybacks. Google Cloud revenue climbed 28%.</p>
        <p>GOOGL stock fell a fraction in overnight action, reversing from strong Tuesday evening gains. Shares closed down 2% to 103.85 on Tuesday. Google stock has a 106.69 cup-with-handle buy point.</p>
        <p>Microsoft and Google earnings and guidance, along with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) later in the week, have big implications for cloud software, networking, artificial intelligence and many other tech plays. Meta, Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and many cloud software names also rose modestly to solidly overnight.</p>
        <h3>Other Key Earnings</h3>
        <p>Boeing reported a wider-than-expected loss, but a 28% revenue gain topped. The aerospace giant stuck to full-year 737 Max jet delivery targets and plans to boost monthly output soon, despite a recent production halt. BA stock stock rose 4% in premarket trade, signaling a possible test of its 50-day line. Shares are working on a 221.43 flat-base buy point.</p>
        <p>Visa earnings exceeded forecasts, boosted by strong cross-border payments. Shares edged higher in extended action. Visa stock sank 1.4% to 229.59 on Tuesday, holding in range of 230.15 cup-with-handle buy point.</p>
        <p>Chipotle earnings topped views with strong same-store sales growth and profit margins. CMG stock spiked 8% in premarket trade. Shares slipped 0.9% to 1,780, at the edge of a buy zone from a cup base.</p>
        <p>Enphase earnings topped but revenue slightly missed and the solar power inverter maker guided low on Q2 revenue. ENPH stock plunged 17% overnight. Shares fell 1.8% on Tuesday to 220.60, pausing in recent days after retaking the 50-day line. Enphase stock is well below its 200-day line and its December all-time highs. Group leader First Solar (FSLR) reports Thursday.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally suffered significant damage Tuesday, with the underlying action even worse than the major indexes.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1% in Tuesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index lost 1.6%, with FRC stock far and away its worst performer. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, with a heavy exposure to regional banks, plunged 2.4%.</p>
        <p>U.S. crude oil prices slid 2.15% to $77.07 a barrel, a new low for April.</p>
        <p>Copper futures sank 2.7% to the lowest close since Jan. 5. The key industrial metal is down nearly 6% in a five-session losing streak. China demand for metals hasn't recovered as much as hoped, with Covid outbreak fears adding to the downside pressure.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield gapped down 12 basis points to 3.4%. The 2-year Treasury yield tumbled 19 basis points to 3.95%. The odds of another Fed rate hike on May 3 fell modestly on Tuesday but remain high. Markets are growing more confident a May rate hike would be the last one.</p>
        <h3>ETFs</h3>
        <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gave up 2.7%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) fell 1.2%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slid 3%, with MSFT stock a major holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slumped 3.2%.</p>
        <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) tumbled 3.3% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 3.35%.</p>
        <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) skidded 3% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 2.3%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) gave back 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gave up 1.9% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) sank 1.1%</p>
        <h3>Bank Stocks</h3>
        <p>FRC stock crashed 49% to a record low. First Republic Bank late Monday reported deposits plunged 41%, or $72 billion, in Q1. That's more than $100 billion excluding bank giants depositing $30 billion in March. Deposits were far worse than expected, and much worse than other regional banks that have reported Q1 results.</p>
        <p>First Republic will cut up to 25% of staff and pursue strategic alternatives. It's exploring a sale of up to $100 billion in assets in a desperate effort to avoid an FDIC seizure. That might require extra incentives, perhaps even government guarantees, to find buyers to pay above market value and closer to book value. A solution needs to come soon.</p>
        <p>First Republic's woes could spur fresh deposit flight from other regional banks, even though regulators have sent strong signals that they'll protect all deposits. But bank stocks won't get a bailout. More broadly, regional bank woes could chill lending with recession fears rising. Longer term, regional banks may face significantly higher funding costs, squeezing profitability.</p>
        <p>The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) tumbled 4.2% on Tuesday, hitting their lowest levels since late 2020. FRC stock and PacWest are KRE components.</p>
        <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) retreated 1.7%. XLF, dominated by financial giants including Visa, is well off its March bottom.</p>
        <p>FRC stock sold off more than 10% early Wednesday but off morning lows.</p>
        <p>PacWest Bancorp (PACW), among the hardest hit in March, jumped more than 10% in premarket trade after saying deposits stabilized at the end of March. PACW stock fell 8.9% on Tuesday.</p>
        <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally showed more strains Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite fell below the 21-day line and 12,000 level, undercutting the past few weeks of trading. It's now just above its 50-day line. Notably, the Nasdaq closed below the low of its March 29 follow-through day, a very bearish sign for the market rally.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 undercut its 21-day moving average, not far from its 50-day either. But the S&P 500 is above the low of its March 29 FTD.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones has come down to its 21-day line.</p>
        <p>Damage was worse below the surface. The First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) skidded 2.1%, below the 50-day line. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) slid 1.7%, back below its 50-day line and right at the 200-day.</p>
        <p>Chip stocks are looking weak, with many big recent winners fading or selling off. The SMH ETF is decisively below the 50-day line, erasing all of its late March gains.</p>
        <p>Software is struggling once again. The IGV ETF is also below its 50-day line, with the technical action far worse in many cloud software plays.</p>
        <p>Homebuilders are looking strong, as well as many medicals and some footwear plays, discounters and restaurants such as CMG stock. But many of those are now extended, and even some of these names took hits on Tuesday. Overall leadership has narrowed considerably</p>
        <p>Losers overwhelmingly beat winners on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The market rally could revive over the next several days if earnings are strong and there's a positive reaction to economic data and the Fed meeting.</p>
        <p>Even Nasdaq futures are only recouping a portion of Tuesday's losses. Even if that holds on Wednesday, a rebound wouldn't be that meaningful if it's largely a few megacaps rebounding.</p>
        <p>But it wouldn't take much for the indexes to break decisively lower. Whipsaw action is quite possible, with earnings and other news spurring big gains or losses one day followed by a reversal in the next session.</p>
        <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
        <p>Investors should have been cutting exposure somewhat in recent days, if only because of individual holdings' performance. The recent market pullback has trigged sell signals in some recent buys, while cutting cushions for bigger winners heading into earnings season.</p>
        <p>If the market rally bounces back in the coming days, buying opportunities will return, but perhaps not right away. Many stocks remain near buy points, though most have backed off somewhat in recent days.</p>
        <p>In this scenario, investors could try to add exposure gradually once again. But don't get excited by overnight action or a bounce at the market open.</p>
        <p>But you also have to be ready for the market to keep deteriorating, spurring a big move into cash.</p>
        <p>Staying engaged, flexible and prepared is always important, but especially in the current environment.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>U.S. stocks sank on Tuesday, led by the Nasdaq as tech conglomerates were set to highlight a busy earnings week.</p>
          <p>At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank by 1.58%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by 1.01% or more than 300 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped by 1.98%.</p>	
          <p>Bond yields slipped after the release of fresh housing and consumer confidence data. The yield on the 10-year note slid to 3.38%, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields also declined to 3.98% Tuesday, a further dip from this morning where it stood above 4%.</p>	
          <p>Wall Street is focused on results from big tech, especially given the sector’s outsized influence on broader market gains so far this year. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are scheduled to report after the bell. Alphabet stock is up 20.1% this year while Microsoft has gained more than 17.5%.</p>
        <p>Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) earnings are on deck for later this week.</p>
        <p>Positive earnings surprises have largely been in line with Wall Street expectations, with about 60% of companies beating sales and 70% topping earnings estimates, a bit below their longer-term averages, according to UBS.</p>
        <p>Another focal point for Wall Street will be the energy market, as some of the largest players post earnings at the end of the week, including Exxon (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Valero (VLO), and TotalEnergies SE (TTE).</p>
        <p>WTI crude oil dropped 2% to $77.11 as it was set to mark the lowest settle value since March 31.</p>
        <p>Separately, home prices climbed in February for the first time since June, ending seven consecutive months of price declines, as buyers came back into the market, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. Still, on the housing front, new home sales surged 9.6% in March, topping economists' expectations of a 1.3% drop for the month.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, consumer confidence dipped again in April as worry over a slowing economy and possible recession weighed on American households. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell to 101.3 in April from 104 in March.</p>
        <p>A selloff of First Republic Bank (FRC) shares continues, sinking more than 40% Tuesday after the regional lender reported on Monday that it had a net loss of $72 billion in deposits during the first three months of this year.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are the trending tickers on Yahoo Finance:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP):</strong> The global goods consumer giant raised its full-year profit guidance following its earnings beat in the first three months of this year, which was boosted by resilient demand and higher prices.</li>
          <li><strong>General Electric Company (GE):</strong> The manufacturer posted first-quarter revenue that jumped 25% in their aerospace business.</li>
          <li><strong>General Motors Company (GM):</strong> The automaker reported an upbeat forecast signaling that the industry’s pricing power will run out of steam.</li>
          <li><strong>3M Company (MMM):</strong> The company announced its restructuring plan that would impact 6,000 positions globally.</li>
          <li><strong>United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS):</strong> Delivery giant fell short on revenue as consumer demand pulls back hurting quarterly sales.</li>
          <li><strong>Spotify (SPOT):</strong> Streaming music leader smashed expectations for new subscribers and total listeners in the first quarter.</li>
          <li><strong>McDonald's Corporation (MCD):</strong> The fast-food restaurant reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations as customers remain loyal even as the restaurant raised its prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elsewhere, bitcoin's (BTC-USD) rebound has been notable for the past six months, with its price almost doubling from its lows last year but as Bespoke Investment Group notes that over the past few days, bitcoin has been testing its 50-day moving average, which has held for now at roughly $27,200.</p>

          <p>Dow stocks rallied in the final hours of Monday’s session to close out a mixed trading day, while Nasdaq slipped. Investors are still holding their collective breath as the heart of big tech earnings season approaches.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.2%. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%.</p>	
          <p>“It's been a slow start to the week in the markets as investors have an eye on what's to come with earnings season getting into full flow and major economic releases on the agenda,” Oanda analyst Craig Erlam writes.</p>	
          <p>The global economy has mostly held up against tighter monetary policy so far, leading to expectations of another hike from the Fed and the European Central Bank next month. The prospect of rates staying higher for longer is one reason why the International Monetary Fund is predicting a substantial slowdown this year.</p>
        <p>“A forecast deterioration in the health of the global economy is weighing on minds,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “With more interest rate rises forecast, and a contraction in lending expected, the worry is that the world’s largest economy will start shrinking.”</p>
        <p>Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley writes that last week’s earnings reports were surprisingly quiet, in terms of how little the U.S. indexes moved.</p>
        <p>“But this week and next may have the potential to push the market out of its congestion phase, one way or the other,” he wrote. “In addition to big tech earnings, over the next 10 days, GDP, the PCE Price Index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge), the monthly jobs report, and a Fed rate decision will all hit the Street.”</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola (ticker: KO) kicked this week’s earnings off with a beat on earnings and revenue for the first quarter, but stock dropped about 0.3%. The bigger test for markets will be results from tech stalwarts like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) after the market closes on Tuesday. They’re followed by Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday.</p>
        <p>“While the macro is clearly not roses and champagne, we believe March earnings season will show better than feared results in the tech space with all investor eyes on the results from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google this week,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives writes.</p>
        <p>Erlam adds that investors are still trying to figure out the real economic consequences of the banking panic earlier this year that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and how such outcomes could steer the Fed’s ongoing fight with inflation.</p>
        <p>“Earnings season is obviously giving us plenty of food for thought in the interim but the first day of the week isn't typically the most thrilling and we're seeing another example of that today,” Erlam writes.</p>

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned higher Monday ahead of a busy week of earnings results that includes tech titans Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT). C3.ai (AI) dived on an analyst downgrade, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI) plunged after issuing a revenue warning.</p>
          <p>On the economic front, Friday is the big day for data, led by the Commerce Department personal income and outlays report for March, which focuses on the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index.</p>	
          <p>Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Both new claims and continuing claims have been on the rise, so weaker employment reports are likely to follow. Also due for release on Thursday, first-quarter GDP growth is expected to show a 2% rise. New home sales, out Tuesday at 10 a.m., are seen dipping to an annualized pace of 632,000 units.</p>	
        <p>Key earnings reports this week include Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), Halliburton (HAL), McDonald's (MCD), PepsiCo (PEP) and Verizon Communications (VZ).</p>
        <p>On Monday morning, Coca Cola (KO) rallied 1.1% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and sales results.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
        <p>Artificial-intelligence play C3.ai plunged more than 9% Monday after Wolfe Research downgraded the stock from peer perform to underperform, with a 14 price target. Super Micro Computer dived as much as 11% after the company warned that its March-quarter revenue would miss its prior forecast. Super Micro now expects revenue of $1.28 billion, below the $1.47 billion midpoint of its earlier forecast.</p>
        <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) dropped 1.1% Monday morning, while Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft were mixed after today's stock market open.</p>
        <p>Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), IBD Leaderboard idea Floor & Decor (FND) and IBD SwingTrader stock Lululemon Athletica (LULU) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Nike (NKE) and Visa (V) — are among the top stocks to buy and watch with the ongoing market rally.</p>
        <p>JPMorgan and Lululemon were featured in last week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. Floor & Decor was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
        <p>After Monday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, and the S&P 500 gained 0.15%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite inched higher in morning action.</p>
        <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) moved up less than 0.1%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) traded up 0.15% early Monday.</p>
        <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Monday traded down to 3.53%. Over the last two weeks, the 10-year yield rebounded from its lowest level since mid-September.</p>
        <p>U.S. oil prices edged lower Monday morning. West Texas Intermediate futures continued to bob between $77 and $78 a barrel, after pulling back from an April 12 high above $83 a barrel.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
        <p>On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, narrowly ending a three-day losing streak. Procter & Gamble (PG) was the benchmark's big winner, up 3.5%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both added 0.1% as well.</p>
        <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "Big Tech stocks have played a key role in the stock market rally so far in 2023, so (the coming week's list of big-tech earnings reports) could be crunchtime. META is a member of the Leaderboard list of top stocks while MSFT has also shown impressive relative strength."</p>
        <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column with the stock market in an uptrend.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: JPMorgan, Nike, Visa</h3>

        <h3>Floor & Decor, Lululemon</h3>

          <p>April 19 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended virtually unchanged on Wednesday while the Dow dipped as investors digested a mixed bag of corporate earnings, including upbeat reports from medical technology companies, countered by weakness in Netflix shares.</p>	
          <p>The Dow was weighed down by declines in Walt Disney Co and UnitedHealth Group Inc shares following results from rivals in their respective industries.</p>	
          <p>Major equity indexes have been largely stable during the early stages of a first-quarter earnings season that investors expect to show tepid results.</p>
        <p>"Corporate results are being seen as being in large part company-specific news versus market news," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. "If that keeps us relatively calm and unchanged for now, while the sample set of reporters is still quite small, I think that's a positive."</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 79.62 points, or 0.23%, to 33,897.01; the S&P 500 lost 0.35 points, or 0.01%, at 4,154.52; and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.81 points, or 0.03%, at 12,157.23.</p>
        <p>The defensive utilities group gained most among S&P 500 sectors, rising 0.8%.</p>
        <p>The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest point since November 2021 during the session.</p>
        <p>Investors are looking for signs in corporate results that inflation may be driving up costs or hurting consumer spending, amid fears the economy may be on the cusp of a downturn.</p>
        <p>S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 4.8% decline in first-quarter earnings from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv IBES.</p>
        <p>"We seem stuck in this range, with those people who think that there is going to be a recession coming and those people who think there is going to be a soft landing," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.</p>
        <p>Netflix Inc shares slid 3.2% after the video-streaming pioneer offered a lighter-than-expected forecast. Shares of streaming rival Disney slipped 2.2%.</p>
        <p>Tesla Inc shares dropped 2% after the electric-vehicle maker's sixth U.S. price cut this year. Tesla shares slid further in initial after-market trading on Wednesday following the company's quarterly report.</p>
        <p>Shares of Elevance Health Inc fell 5.3% after the insurer's strong quarterly profit failed to ease investor concerns over regulatory hits to the company's government-backed insurance business. UnitedHealth shares dropped 3.6%.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in healthcare, Abbott Laboratories shares jumped 7.8% after the medical device maker said most delayed non-urgent medical procedures had resumed globally three years into the COVID-19 pandemic. Intuitive Surgical shares soared 10.9% after its quarterly revenue and profit topped estimates.</p>
        <p>Shares of Western Alliance Bancorp surged 24.1% after the company posted stronger-than-expected earnings, helping lift the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF 3.9%.</p>
        <p>Regional banks have been in focus after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month prompted concerns about systemic risks.</p>
        <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and one new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 123 new lows.</p>
        <p>About 10 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Richard Chang)</p>

          <p>The stock market was off session lows at midday Wednesday but still modestly lower as investors keyed on earnings reports from Netflix (NFLX) and other major companies. IBD 50 company Shift4 (FOUR) plunged, hurting that index. Nasdaq 100 stock Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) soared after the company blew away earnings expectations.</p>
          <p>Shortly before noon on Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reduced their losses to 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite had been down about 0.6% earlier as the 12,000 mark seems to hold.</p>	
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 shed 0.5%. Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq compared with the same time on Tuesday.</p>	
          <p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) underperformed with a 1.5% decline at midday.</p>
        <p>Shift4 did some damage to the IBD 50 as the payment processing firm sold off 12%, piercing the 50-day moving average in heavy volume. FOUR stock was forming an ascending base, but now has a sell signal. Short seller Blue Orca accused the company of accounting practices that inflate its performance.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 3.63%.</p>
        <h3>Netflix, Morgan Stanley Fall On Earnings</h3>
        <p>Netflix stock fell more than 3% in heavy volume, making it one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks. The video streaming service missed Wall Street's Q1 target for new subscribers and its outlook was soft. Earnings fell 18% while sales climbed 4%. Despite the loss, Netflix stock continues to work on a cup-with-handle base.</p>
        <p><strong>Morgan Stanley (MS)</strong>trimmed its loss to about 1% after sinking as much as 3.7%. The investment bank's Q1 2023 profit fell but still beat estimates. Revenue also topped expectations but fell 2% year over year. Investment banking revenue tumbled 24% while trading revenue slid 13%.</p>
        <p>But regional banks — an industry feared to have liquidity problems — shined in Wednesday's stock market on encouraging earnings reports. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1.3% and is finding support around 42.</p>
        <p><strong>Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL)</strong> soared 13% in heavy trading. UBS analyst Brody Preston gave positive comments on a $2 billion increase in deposits so far this quarter, as the report calmed concerns about liquidity and capital.</p>
        <p>It would be the stock's largest increase since Nov. 9, 2020, when it rose 23.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p>
        <p><strong>U.S. Bancorp (USB)</strong> reversed modestly lower, erasing a 2.5% gain, after it reported first-quarter results that topped estimates. Rising interest rates and its acquisition of MUFG Union Bank boosted the quarter for the parent company of U.S. Bank.</p>
        <p><strong>Synchrony Financial (SYF)</strong> trimmed gains to 1% in active trading following a mixed Q1 report for  the consumer financial services firm.</p>
        <p>Dow Jones component Travelers (TRV) climbed 6% after the insurance provider comfortably beat profit expectations. TRV stock regained its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.</p>
        <h3>Nasdaq 100 Stock Soars As Procedures Surge</h3>
        <p>Nasdaq 100 stock Intuitive Surgical roared higher, up 12% as shares gapped above a cup base with a 285.19 buy point. The stock is having its best day since March 24, 2020, when it jumped 17.4%.</p>
        <p>Late Tuesday, the company beat first-quarter profit and sales expectations. Intuitive Surgical saw a  resurgence in robotic surgery procedures during the quarter. Revenue jumped 14% to $1.7 billion, as adjusted earnings rose 9% to $1.23 per share.</p>
        <p>Semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML) beat Wall Street's targets for the first quarter but noted some caution among customers. Shares gapped down nearly 4% but remain in a cup with handle.</p>
        <p>Tesla (TSLA) fell 1.5% ahead of the EV maker's earnings report after today's close.</p>
        <p>Late Tuesday, Tesla trimmed prices in the U.S. for the second time this month. It cut Model Y prices by $3,000, to a starting price of $46,990. Model 3 prices were cut by $2,000, to $39,990. It was Tesla's sixth price cut so far this year and follows cuts in Europe, Singapore and Israel last Friday.</p>
        <p>Tech products distributor CDW (CDW) gapped down nearly 14% in big volume. The company announced Q1 revenue that missed estimates as customers pulled back on spending. It's on pace for its worst day since the height of the pandemic.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market: More Earnings After The Close</h3>
        <p>After the stock market close, Dow component IBM (IBM), chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are among the notable earnings reports.</p>
        <p>There's little on today's economic calendar, but the Fed's Beige Book survey will be released at 2 p.m. ET. Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are scheduled to give speeches this evening, according to Econoday.</p>

          <p>April 18 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 eked out a slim gain on Tuesday after strength in some big technology stocks countered disappointing quarterly reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs as first-quarter earnings season kicked into gear.</p>
          <p>The Dow and Nasdaq ended with fractional declines on the day.</p>	
          <p>J&J shares fell 2.8% after the healthcare conglomerate cautioned investors over the lingering impact of inflation-driven costs this year. Goldman shares dropped 1.7% after the Wall Street firm's profit fell 19% as dealmaking and bond trading slumped.</p>	
          <p>The early quarterly results from S&P 500 companies come as investors have been bracing for a gloomy reporting season, fearing the economy may be on the cusp of a downturn.</p>
        <p>"What we are seeing here is the calm before the storm as far as earnings go," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network. "The market is just trying to see, do we have some upside here or not, and I think it is really going to come down to earnings over the next couple of weeks."</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.55 points, or 0.03%, to 33,976.63, the S&P 500 gained 3.55 points, or 0.09%, to 4,154.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.31 points, or 0.04%, to 12,153.41.</p>
        <p>The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest point since January 2022 during the session.</p>
        <p>The heavyweight technology sector rose 0.4%, helped by a 2.5% increase in shares of Nvidia Corp after HSBC raised its recommendation on the graphics chipmaker to "buy" from "reduce."</p>
        <p>The healthcare sector dropped 0.7%, weighed down by J&J shares.</p>
        <p>S&P 500 company earnings are expected to have declined 4.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of Friday. Investors have zeroed in on bank results after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month set off concerns about potential systemic risks.</p>
        <p>"While the big money center banks did very well as a whole, the focus I think is going to be on the regional banks because that is really where the center of the fallout was," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management.</p>
        <p>Shares of Netflix Inc fell in initial after-hours trading on Tuesday following the company's quarterly report.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 is trading near two-month highs as investors await a deluge of earnings and assess the interest rate path ahead of an expected 25 basis point increase at the Federal Reserve's meeting early next month.</p>
        <p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Reuters on Tuesday the U.S. central bank should continue raising rates on the back of recent data showing persistent inflation. Separately, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the Fed most likely has one more rate hike ahead.</p>
        <p>In other earnings news, Lockheed Martin Corp's shares rose 2.4% after the U.S. weapons maker's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street targets despite parts and labor shortages.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 143 new lows.</p>
        <p>About 9.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.</p>

          <p>Dow Jones Industrial Average rose off the day's lows and traded nearly flat at 1:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Dow stocks Salesforce (CRM), Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) all rose. JPMorgan (JPM) and Cisco (CSCO) also gained ground while health care stocks fell.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 was also flat in early afternoon trading. However, the index faces resistance at the current level. According to John Lynch, Chief Investment Officer at Comerica, a test of October's lows cannot be ruled out as the risk of an earnings recession looms.</p>	
          <p>The "combination of declining earnings, weakening economic growth, a steadfast Federal Reserve, and a lack of broad participation suggests the equity market is poised to struggle in the weeks and months ahead."</p>	
          <p>FactSet estimates expect an earnings recession, with profits declining 6.0% in the first quarter, greater than the five-year average intra-quarter decline of 2.8%. If met, it would represent a consecutive quarterly decline in corporate profits, resulting in an EPS recession.</p>
        <p><strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> gained after an analyst upgrade.</p>
        <p>Homebuilder stocks Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) rallied ahead of Thursday earnings. Both stocks are in buy zones.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq  fell 0.2% while the small-cap Russell 2000 saw a bigger drop of 0.6%. Travel and leisure stocks Airbnb (ABNB) and Booking (BKNG) rose.</p>
        <p>Volume was lighter on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq compared to the same time Monday.</p>
        <p>Crude oil notched a small gain to trade at $80.93 per barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1 basis point to 3.58%.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin held steady after clearing a critical level last week.</p>
        <p>The leading crypto coin hit the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022, according to CoinMarketCap. It is a new high for the year after a prolonged crypto winter and black swan events like the FTX crash in November, which pummeled crypto instruments.</p>
        <h3>Stocks Moving Today</h3>
        <p><strong>Bank of America (BAC)</strong> gained in afternoon trading after strong earnings. Net interest income rose 25% as interest rates surged, helping the money-center bank post a strong quarter.</p>
        <p>Weak bond trading and fewer deals undermined Goldman Sachs (GS) quarterly revenue. GS shares were testing the 50-day line after diving over 3%.</p>
        <p><strong>Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)</strong> fell sharply despite posting a strong quarter. The Dow Jones leader raised its full-year earnings outlook to $10.60-$10.70 per share. Sales of its cancer drugs and treatment for Crohn's disease was strong. Investors may have been disappointed by the lack of clarity on baby powder class-action lawsuits.</p>
        <p>HSBC raised its Nvidia (NVDA) price target to 355 and upgraded its rating to buy from reduce. The IBD Leaderboard stock jumped 3%. Shares are extended with no clear base or entry yet.</p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin (LMT) broke out of a flat base after earnings. M/I Homes (MHO) broke out of a cup with handle with a buy point at 63.57. Crocs (CROX) on IBD SwingTrader broke out at an entry of 143.60, with a relative strength line at new highs.</p>
        <h3>AI Race Takes A Turn</h3>
        <p>Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk incorporated a new company in March that will develop artificial-intelligence technologies. Musk helped found OpenAI in 2015 but left it in 2018.</p>
        <p>The new company, called X.ai, has 100 million shares on offer in a private sale. X.ai has plans of developing 'TruthGPT' that will rival Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), C3.ai (AI), OpenAI and DeepMind.</p>
        <p>AI plays had mixed price action after the news.</p>
        <p>C3.ai (AI) gained 4% and held most of its gains on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) continued to slip after falling on Monday. Shares also fell on news that Samsung might use Bing rather than Google on its phones. Dow Jones component Microsoft (MSFT) also slipped slightly. GOOGL is back below its buy point of 106.69, while Microsoft is in a buy zone above a base.</p>
        <h3>Earnings Deck Outside Dow Jones</h3>
        <p><strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> rose slightly in the afternoon. The streaming giant reports earnings after the close. Analysts are looking for a profit of $2.87 per share. NFLX stock has added more than 12% this year and has doubled in price since bottoming out in May 2022.</p>
        <p>Shares are in a cup with handle with a potential entry at 349.90. United Airlines (UAL) is on tap as well this evening. Shares are clearing the 200-day line.</p>
        <p>Tesla's earnings are due Wednesday. Morgan Stanley (MS) earnings are also on deck.</p>
        <p>Housing starts and building permits declined in March. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department showed that single-family housing starts rose 2.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis. Single-family building permits rose 4.1%, but multifamily homes fell.</p>

          <p>April 18 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index was little changed on Tuesday as a drop in Goldman Sachs' profit dampened optimism about resilience in the banking sector, with gains in technology stocks helping keep the index afloat.</p>	
          <p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc dropped 2.5% after its quarterly profit fell 19%, hit by sluggish dealmaking and losses from the sale of some loans from its consumer unit Marcus.</p>	
          <p>Bank of America Corp slipped 0.6% in choppy trade even as its first-quarter profit beat analysts' estimate. The wider banking index was down 0.2%.</p>
        <p>Johnson & Johnson fell 2.6% as the healthcare conglomerate's 2023 profit forecast was seen as cautious by several analysts.</p>
        <p>"We expect earnings to really be stressed. It's all kind of this slow motion fall into a recession and that earnings recession is really kind of the next shoe to drop," said Brandon Pizzurro, director of public investments at Guidestone Capital Management.</p>
        <p>Investor expectations were buoyed by strong results from big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co last week in the backdrop of the recent banking turmoil sparked by the collapse of some mid-sized U.S. lenders.</p>
        <p>The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, edged up to 17.15 after hitting an over one-year low earlier.</p>
        <p>The main Wall Street indexes have traded in a tight range since earnings season kicked off but remain close to two-month highs on expectations that the Fed is nearing the end of its monetary tightening cycle.</p>
        <p>Mixed economic data recently has supported bets the Fed will hike interest rates by 25 basis points in May and hit pause before cutting rates in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>St. Louis President James Bullard said that the Fed should continue raising rates as recent data has indicated sticky inflation, while the broader economy seems poised to continue growing, even if slowly.</p>
        <p>At 10:12 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 121.20 points, or 0.36%, at 33,865.98, the S&P 500 was up 1.79 points, or 0.04%, at 4,153.11, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 16.03 points, or 0.13%, at 12,173.75.</p>
        <p>Nvidia Corp jumped 4% after HSBC upgraded the chipmaker's stock to "buy" from "reduce", surprised by its pricing power on artificial intelligence (AI) chips.</p>
        <p>Investors will monitor quarterly earnings from Netflix Inc after market hours.</p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin Corp rose 2.9% after quarterly results of the U.S. weapons maker's surpassed Wall Street targets as simmering geopolitical tensions fueled demand from both domestic and international customers.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, while decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 36 new lows.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Thursday as economic data showed cooling inflation and a loosening labor market, fueling optimism that the Federal Reserve could be nearing the end of its aggressive interest rate hike cycle.</p>
          <p>All three major U.S. stock indexes surged, with interest rate sensitive megacaps providing the most upside muscle and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its biggest one-day percentage jump in nearly a month.</p>	
          <p>Data released before the bell showed a steeper-than-expected cooldown in producer prices and new claims for jobless benefits coming in above consensus. Both signal that the Fed's hawkish barrage of rate hikes, which began over a year ago, is working as intended.</p>	
          <p>The data comes on the heels of Wednesday's muted Consumer Price Index report, which cemented the likelihood of yet another 25 basis point rate hike at the conclusion next month's FOMC policy meeting.</p>
        <p>"Markets rallied today following the lower inflation data this morning, as it's still all about the Fed so it's really all about inflation," said David Carter, investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank in New York.</p>
        <p>"Together with yesterday's muted CPI data, PPI is also suggesting some slowdown in inflation which could mean a quick end to Fed tightening."</p>
        <p>Financial markets are pricing in a roughly one-in-three probability that the central bank will press the pause button and let the Fed funds target rate stand in the 4.75% to 5.00% range, according to CME's FedWatch tool.</p>
        <p>Investor focus now shifts to first-quarter earnings season, which jumps into full swing on Friday when a trio of big banks, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co report.</p>
        <p>"Tomorrow's bank earnings could give insight into the strength of regional banks and future lending activity," Carter added. "It will be interesting to see what banks say tomorrow about future economic growth."</p>
        <p>Analysts expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to come in 5.2% below the year-ago quarter, a stark reversal from the 1.4% year-on-year growth seen at the beginning of the quarter, according to Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 53.96 points, or 1.33%, to end at 4,145.91 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 236.94 points, or 1.99%, to 12,166.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 382.54 points, or 1.14%, to 34,029.04.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines Inc shares dipped following the company's first-quarter profit miss.</p>
        <p>Shares of Harley-Davidson Inc slid after the motorcycle maker announced Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter was leaving the company at the end of April.</p>
        <p>Groupon Inc jumped following the company's appointment of Jiri Ponrt to succeed Damien Schmitz as chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Netflix Inc advanced after Wedbush said the streaming platform's revenue growth of new subscribers could drive up profitability.</p>

          <p>NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday as economic data showed cooling inflation and a loosening labor market, fueling optimism that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its aggressive interest rate hike cycle.</p>
          <p>All three major U.S. stock indexes rose sharply, with interest rate sensitive megacaps including Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com providing the most upside muscle and sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 1.9%, on track for its biggest one-day gain in nearly a month.</p>	
          <p>Data released before the bell showed a steeper-than-expected cooldown in producer prices and new claims for jobless benefits coming in above consensus. Both signal that the Fed's hawkish barrage of rate hikes, which began over a year ago, is working as intended.</p>	
          <p>"Inflation is going to come down faster than the Fed thinks it will, but ironically the banking crisis is bullish for a Fed pause, which is bullish for the market, particularly tech stocks," said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer and Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.</p>
        <p>The data comes on the heels of Wednesday's cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index report, which raised the likelihood of yet another 25 basis point rate hike at the conclusion next month's FOMC policy meeting.</p>
        <p>"The Fed will raise rates one more time in May; one and done," Hatfield added. "They are worried about the banking system, so that should help them get to the right answer.</p>
        <p>"They'll start cutting in 2024."</p>
        <p>Financial markets are pricing in a roughly one-in-three probability that the central bank will press the pause button and let the Fed funds target rate stand in the 4.75% to 5.00% range.</p>
        <p>Investor focus now shifts to first-quarter earnings season, which jumps into full swing on Friday when a trio of big banks, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co report.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to come in 5.2% below the year-ago quarter, a stark reversal from the 1.4% year-on-year growth seen at the beginning of the quarter, according to Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>At 2:05 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 325.52 points, or 0.97%, to 33,972.02; the S&P 500 gained 49.03 points, or 1.20%, at 4,140.98; and the Nasdaq Composite added 225.84 points, or 1.89%, at 12,155.18.</p>
        <p>Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, communication services was up the most, while industrials and materials, outperformers in recent sessions, suffered the steepest percentage declines.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines Inc shares fell 0.9% following the company's first-quarter profit miss.</p>
        <p>Shares of Harley-Davidson Inc slid 3.2% after the motorcycle maker announced Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter was leaving the company at the end of April.</p>
        <p>Groupon Inc jumped 3.4% after the company appointed Jiri Ponrt to succeed Damien Schmitz as chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Netflix Inc rose 4.1% after Wedbush said the streaming platform's revenue growth of new subscribers could drive up profitability.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 121 new lows. (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Chang)</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Delta Air Lines earnings missed views while more economic data is on tap.</p>
          <p>The stock market rally retreated Wednesday as the Federal Reserve saw the banking crisis spurring a recession.</p>	  
          <p>Newly released minutes from the March 21-22 Federal Reserve meeting showed Fed staff forecasting "a mild recession starting later this year." Policymakers expected banking stress to "weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation," Fed minutes showed. Members remained "highly attentive" to inflation risks, however. While several policymakers mulled keeping rates steady, they ultimately voted for a quarter-point rate hike, to a 4.75%-5%.</p>	
          <p>Before the open, the consumer price index came in less than expected, with the CPI inflation rate tumbling a full percentage point to 5%. But core inflation, which excludes food and energy, ticked higher to 5.6%, as expected.</p>
        <p>The odds of a Fed rate hike in early May barely dipped, to around 70%.</p>
        <p>China stocks were hard hit after Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett signaled his concern about geopolitical tensions, notably China and Taiwan. Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), PDD Holdings (PDD) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) all fell hard.</p>
        <p>BABA stock fell Thursday night on a report that SoftBank planned to sell much of its stake in the China e-commerce giant. But shares turned higher before the open.</p>
        <p>TSLA stock hit resistance at a key level, continuing to consolidate ahead of Tesla (TSLA) earnings next week.</p>
        <p>Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Cloudflare (NET), Crocs (CROX) and Merck (MRK) are all trading near potential entries, with MRK stock getting an analyst upgrade early Thursday.</p>
        <p>ServiceNow and CROX stock are on SwingTrader. NOW stock and Crocs also are on the IBD 50. Shopify was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
        <h3>Delta Earnings</h3>
        <p>Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported Q1 earnings before the open, kicking off results for carriers. Adjusted EPS fell short, even as revenue solidly beat. But the carrier guided higher on Q2 EPS.</p>
        <p>DAL stock rose modestly before the open. Delta shares fell 2.4% Wednesday, below the 200-day line, after American Airlines (AAL) gave first-quarter preliminary results that were slightly above its January guidance, but below analyst consensus. AAL stock tumbled 9.2% to a three-month low Wednesday, but also bounced slightly on Thursday.</p>
        <h3>Drug News</h3>
        <p>Novo Nordisk (NVO) raised its 2023 EPS and sales targets, as an obesity drug sees booming demand. NVO stock, already at record highs, rose modestly in premarket trade.</p>
        <p>Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) tumbled on a report that FDA staff were leaning toward opposing its gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy earlier this year before a top official intervened.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
        <p>Dow Jones futures were steady vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures edged higher and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.15%.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department will release the March producer price index and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p>
        <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally initially opened solidly higher on the CPI inflation report, pulled back, and then wavered until Fed recession fears took hold.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1% in Wednesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index fell 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite slumped 0.85%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 0.7%.</p>
        <p>U.S. crude oil prices rose 2.1% to $83.26 a barrel, the highest close in nearly five months.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell 1 basis point to 3.42% after hitting 3.34% soon after the open. The two-year yield fell 9 basis points to 3.97%. The 3-month T-bill yield nudged down, just 2 basis points to 5.01%.</p>
        <h3>ETFs</h3>
        <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 0.7%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) inched up 0.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dipped 0.2%, with NOW stock a significant component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.8%.</p>
        <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 2.9% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) retreated 2.3%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs, with Shopify a top-10 holding. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns a small BYD stock stake.</p>
        <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) fell 0.8% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) rose 0.4%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 3.1%, with Delta and AAL stock big components. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) dipped 0.1%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) edged up 0.1% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) ended fractionally higher.</p>
        <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dipped 0.2%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell 1.1%.</p>
        <h3>Buffett Wary Of China Tensions</h3>
        <p>Warren Buffett said Wednesday on CNBC that he thinks China EV giant BYD (BYDDF) is "extraordinary" while Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is a "fabulous enterprise." But that didn't stop Berkshire from substantially cutting its stakes in both companies.</p>
        <p>Buffett made a big bet on TSM in Q3, but then slashed the position by 86% in Q4. He said he "re-evaluated" China-Taiwan tensions, not the business or management.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Berkshire has roughly halved its big, long-term stake in BYD starting in August, with the latest share reduction disclosed earlier this week.</p>
        <p>TSM stock fell 2.7% on Wednesday, trading below the 50-day line. BYD stock sank 3.9%, back below its 50-day.</p>
        <p>But many China internets had bigger losses. BABA tumbled 5.9%, undercutting its 50-day line within a cup-with-handle base.</p>
        <p>JD stock slumped 7.65% to its worst level since its October lows. PDD stock skidded 5.2%, starting to losing sight of its 200-day line. TCEHY stock gave up 5.4%, knifing below its 50-day.</p>
        <p>The Krane CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) slumped 4.5% to 28.62, below its 200-day line. It hit a 52-week high of 36.19 on Jan. 26 after more than doubling from its October low.</p>
        <p>SoftBank plans to sell the bulk of its Alibaba stake, the Financial Times reported late Wednesday. Alibaba fell 4% or more so initially, but is now up slightly early Thursday. Other China stocks looked set to regain some of their losses.</p>
        <h3>Stocks Near Buy Points</h3>
        <p>SHOP stock climbed 1.2% on Wednesday to 45.30, but came well off an intraday high of 48.75. Investors could use 48.36 as an early entry. JMP Securities upgraded Shopify stock to a buy rating on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>NOW stock edged up 0.3% to 471.43, but well off session highs as well. ServiceNow stock now has a handle on its cup base, giving it a 482.43 buy point.</p>
        <p>NET stock popped 3.9% to 63.04. Intraday, shares topped a 63.19 early entry in a consolidation.</p>
        <p>CROX stock fell 1.5% to 126.19. Shares are working on a 143.60 official buy point. But investors could use 130.90 as an early entry, which would clear the bulk of trading going back to Jan. 18.</p>
        <p>MRK stock climbed 1.1% to 113.75 on Wednesday. Shares are near a 115.59 consolidation buy point. The Dow Jones drug giant has been wedging up in the recent days, not creating much of a shakeout. Merck stock rose slightly Thursday as Citigroup upgraded it to a buy, raising the price target to 130 from 105.</p>
        <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
        <p>Tesla stock fell 3.35% to 180.54. reversing lower from near the 50-day moving average. Shares are still within a cup-with-handle base with a 217.75 buy point, according to  MarketSmith analysis. The base formed below the 200-day line, which has drifted down to about 214. Investors may want to use a decisive clearing of the 200-day line as an entry.</p>
        <p>Tesla will cut some Model 3 and Y prices in Hong Kong on April 15, the Hong Kong Economic Times reported Wednesday, including a 14% reduction for the Model 3 Performance variant.</p>
        <p>TSLA stock tumbled 10.8% last week, as Tesla cut EV prices in the U.S. and Australia following record Q1 deliveries that fell short of views.</p>
        <p>Tesla earnings are due April 19, with gross margins in focus.</p>
        <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally was up and down Wednesday, taking a more-decisive trend lower starting midafternoon. It's not just that Fed staff forecast a recession, it's that markets see policymakers still raising rates, one final time.</p>
        <p>Bearish outside reversals are never a great sign, but the major indexes haven't significantly changed their character — yet.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq, off for a third straight session, fell below the 12,000 level but is still above its 21-day. The tech-heavy index has suffered three distribution days in the past five sessions, something to note.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 briefly topped its early April highs before fading. The Dow Jones reversed from its best levels in nearly two months.</p>
        <p>The Russell 2000 fell back below its 21-day line.</p>
        <p>Some leading stocks made gains. But many others reversed lower from opening gains.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and many growth stocks are close to breaking above key levels. But they're also not far from breaking below important support.</p>
        <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
        <p>This is not a rip-roaring stock market rally. The major indexes have moved sideways over the past couple of months, with big swings in sectors and leaders at various points. So while investors should be taking part, it's not a time to be super aggressive.</p>
        <p>How exposed should you be? If your stocks are working, your exposure might be 40%, 50%, or more depending on your risk tolerance. If you've been shaken out of stocks or had to cut a number of losers, your exposure might be quite less.</p>
        <p>Either way, if and when conditions improve, you can gradually make new buys and add to your exposure. Stay engaged and remain flexible. Have your watchlists ready and your exit strategies in place.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Tesco (TSCO.L) has reported a jump in yearly sales but profits halved in what the grocer called an “incredibly tough year for customers”</p>
          <p>While its sales rose 7.2% to £65.7bn, pre-tax profits dropped from just over £2bn to around £1bn, as shoppers made more trips to the supermarket but bought fewer items.</p>	
          <p>Bosses said the supermarket giant had come under pressure from rising prices as its customers also struggled under soaring inflation.</p>	
          <p>“It’s been an incredibly tough year for many of our customers, and we have been determined to do everything we can to help,” said chief executive Ken Murphy.</p>
        <p>“Our results reflect our continued investment in delivering great value and quality for our customers, whilst at the same time looking after our colleagues.</p>
        <p>“This is despite unprecedented levels of inflation in the prices we have paid our suppliers for their products, and the cost of running our own operations.”</p>
        <p>Sales of food in the UK rose 4.6% in the year, led by the group’s own-label ranges, with sales of its premium Finest range up nearly 7% and its cheapest “Exclusively at Tesco” range up 6%.</p>
        <p>Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said: “Tesco is continuing to cement its position as the UK’s top supermarket.</p>
        <p>“Profits may be down, but that was to be expected from the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis and post-pandemic normalisation in shopping habits.</p>
        <p>“Sales growth, meanwhile, remains robust and Tesco is well placed to benefit from consumers looking to save on their weekly shop through its different initiatives – particularly its Clubcard scheme.</p>
        <p>“While profits are expected to be flat for the year ahead, the continuation of its share buyback scheme and strong execution of its strategy mean Tesco remains in good shape.”</p>
        <p>Shareholders will receive a dividend of 7.05p a share worth £516m in June, with the company also announcing plans for a buyback of its shares worth £750m.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 stock, which has been trading at an eight month high in recent sessions, rose 2.34% to 273.6p as investors also welcomed plans for a further buyback of shares.</p>
        <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “With the current challenges unlikely to abate in the medium term, Tesco is guiding for flat retail profits in the year ahead, being extremely mindful that any lessening of its focus could have an immediate and damaging impact. While the company remains the one to beat in terms of size in the UK, growth is also increasingly hard to come by given the higher base.</p>
        <p>“Indeed, the share price has struggled to make much progress of late. Despite a bounce of 34% over the last six months, the shares remain down by 1% over the last year, as compared to a gain of 3.2% for the wider FTSE100. The three-year performance is rather more respectable, with the shares having added 20% and investor optimism has not dwindled in the face of such aggressive competition. The market consensus of the shares as a strong buy is testament to the esteem in which many investors still hold the stock.”</p>
        <p>AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould added: "Holding on to customers in a cost of living crisis is no joke, even for a company with the scale and purchasing power of Tesco. The company is having to take a hit on profit and margins to keep the tills ringing and customers heading through its doors.</p>
        <p>“This hit is even more acute because Tesco is itself exposed to higher labour and energy costs. Online groceries, which finally started to make a positive contribution during the pandemic will also be heavily impacted by smaller basket sizes as the costs for Tesco of delivering the goods don’t change in proportion to the amount ordered.</p>
        <p>“Tesco seems to be making the calculation that it can absorb some pain now to maintain and even improve its market share, particularly from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl, and emerge in a stronger position once the economic outlook starts to pick up.</p>
        <p>“There is merit to this strategy, particularly at a time when rivals, most notably Morrisons, are really struggling and don’t have Tesco’s financial strength.</p>
        <p>“What Tesco doesn’t want to be drawn into is a race to the bottom on prices which cuts margins right to the bone for a prolonged period. For now, this is the tricky tightrope the supermarket must walk, while rewarding investors for their patience with steady dividends.”</p>
        <p>Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy, said: “These results show Tesco is doing very well during the cost of living crisis, while millions of its customers struggle to put food on the table due to soaring grocery price inflation. It’s clear that Tesco and all the major supermarkets could be working harder to make food more affordable for customers who need help.</p>
        <p>“While we want to see British businesses do well, Tesco has an important role as the UK’s largest supermarket to lead the way on making affordable ranges of healthy, nutritious food more widely available, especially in those areas most in need. The supermarket should also be making pricing clearer, more transparent and more consistent, particularly on Clubcard offers, so consumers can easily compare prices in-store and with other supermarkets.”</p>

          <p>By Stephen Culp</p>
          <p>NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 gained ground on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting revealed several voting members of the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) considered a pause in interest rate hikes amid the regional bank liquidity crisis.</p>	
          <p>The minutes followed a cooler-than-expected inflation report which belied stickier underlying data and cemented the likelihood of another policy rate hike when the Fed convenes next month.</p>	
          <p>All three major U.S. stock indexes were last in positive territory, with cyclical sectors putting the blue-chip Dow in the lead.</p>
        <p>"The Fed is a consensus driven institution," said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. "The market has been very eager to trade that peak policy Fed behavior - the pause and pivot - and the Fed is not communicating that at all."</p>
        <p>The major indexes seesawed as market participants parsed the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>
        <p>That report, on prices urban consumers pay for a basket of goods and services, came in below analysts' expectations, suggesting that the Fed's efforts to tame inflation is taking effect.</p>
        <p>However, core CPI - which strips out volatile food and energy items - hit the consensus bull's eye, and remains well above the Fed's average annual 2% target rate.</p>
        <p>"We saw progress on headline inflation and people started digging in and the initial optimism reversed," Hill added. "The core numbers have seen improvement but they’re well above where they need to be."</p>
        <p>Earlier in the session Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin underscored that reality, remarking that inflation has a long way to go before approaching that target.</p>
        <p>At last glance, financial markets have priced in a 71% likelihood of another 25 basis point interest rate hike at the conclusion of the FOMC's policy meeting next month, and a 29% probability the Fed funds target rate will remain at 4.75% to 5.00%.</p>
        <p>The next market-moving catalyst is likely to be first-quarter earnings season, which kicks off on Friday with results from three big banks - Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.</p>
        <p>Analysts now expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings down 5.2% year-on-year, a stark reversal from the 1.4% annual growth seen at the beginning of the quarter.</p>
        <p>At 2:06 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.28 points, or 0.51%, to 33,857.07, the S&P 500 gained 14.01 points, or 0.34%, at 4,122.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.68 points, or 0.05%, at 12,037.56.</p>
        <p>Among the 11 sectors of the S&P 500, industrials were enjoying the largest percentage gain, while consumer staples and consumer discretionary were both in the red.</p>
        <p>American Airlines Group Inc slid 9.1% after it forecast a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 143 new lows.</p>

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly rose more than 150 points Wednesday on cooler-than-expected inflation data, with the release of the Consumer Price Index. Meanwhile, minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting are due out in the afternoon.</p>
          <p>The Labor Department's March CPI report showed inflation rising 0.1% for the month, cooler than Wall Street's expected 0.3% monthly rise. Year over year, the CPI increased 5%, below the 5.2% estimate. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.4% on the month, with a one-year gain of 5.6%, both matching Wall Street's estimates.</p>	
          <p>Meanwhile, first-quarter earnings season looms as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial (PNC) kick off bank earnings on Friday. Further, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reports Thursday and UnitedHealth (UNH) earnings are out Friday.</p>

        <h3>By Sean Williams</h3>
        <p>A 33% plunge in the Nasdaq Composite is the perfect excuse for opportunistic investors to pounce on discounted growth stocks.</p>
        <p>Although it can be an unpleasant learning experience for new investors, Wall Street provided a reminder last year that stocks can, indeed, go down just as easily as they can rise. Although all three major U.S. stock indexes endured their worst year since 2008, it was the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) that was hit hardest -- a 33% decline.</p>
        <p>But here's the interesting thing about bear market declines in the major stock indexes: They're always a red-carpet opportunity for long-term investors. Despite the Nasdaq Composite undergoing numerous double-digit percentage corrections, a bull market has always, eventually, recouped its losses (and some).</p>
        <p>Since growth stocks took it on the chin over the past 15 months, they're the most logical niche of stocks to bounce back when a new bull market takes shape. What follows are five astonishing growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
        <h3>Vertex Pharmaceuticals</h3>
        <p>The first awe-inspiring growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market decline is biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.09%). Despite its drug portfolio being concentrated in one area of focus, the company's cash flow is well protected.</p>
        <p>Vertex is best known for its role in helping improve the lives of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease characterized by thick mucus production that can obstruct a person's lungs and/or pancreas. Vertex has developed four generations of Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies aimed at improving lung function for patients with the most common CF mutation (F508del). The latest of these treatments, Trikafta, is bringing in more than $8 billion in annual run-rate sales.</p>
        <p>No other drug developer is particularly close to disrupting Vertex in CF. To boot, the company has other areas of focus that may soon be generating recurring revenue. This includes exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) for patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. With a rolling biologics license application for exa-cel in the U.S., Vertex and development partner CRISPR Therapeutics could soon have a new blockbuster on their hands.</p>
        <p>And have I mentioned that Vertex is sitting on a hearty cash pile? Even after outlaying capital to acquire ViaCyte, Vertex's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities grew by $3.3 billion in 2022 to $10.8 billion. This capital puts a healthy floor beneath Vertex's stock and makes its forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 20 appear all the cheaper.</p>
        <h3>PubMatic</h3>
        <p>A second stellar growth stock you'll regret not scooping up on the Nasdaq bear market drop is adtech company PubMatic (PUBM 2.28%). Although it's perfectly normal for ad spending to taper off when the prospects of a recession are climbing, PubMatic finds itself perfectly positioned to take advantage of the shift to digital advertising.</p>
        <p>PubMatic is what's known as a sell-side platform (SSP) in the programmatic ad space. In English, this just means it helps advertisers sell their digital display space using software on its cloud-based platform. One advantage of being an SSP is the amount of consolidation that's occurred in recent years. With fewer competitors, PubMatic has been able to grow its share of the digital ad market.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more importantly, PubMatic is focused on the fastest-growing aspects of the digital ad industry. Whereas the digital ad industry is forecast to grow by 14% on an annualized basis through 2025, PubMatic is generating more than a third of its revenue from omnichannel video programmatic ads, such as connected TV, which are growing at roughly twice the annualized rate as the industry forecast. In short, PubMatic's organic growth rate should easily outpace its peers.</p>
        <p>Another overlooked advantage to PubMatic's operating model is its cloud-based infrastructure. The company chose to build out its own infrastructure rather than rely on a third-party provider. This should prove particularly beneficial to PubMatic's operating margin as its revenue scales.</p>
        <h3>Datadog</h3>
        <p>The third astonishing growth stock just begging to be bought with the Nasdaq mired in a bear market is infrastructure and application monitoring stock Datadog (DDOG -0.42%). While Datadog's premium valuation is a potential headwind during a bear market and possible recession, the company's competitive edge and phenomenal operating performance make it a lot cheaper than most investors realize.</p>
        <p>On a macro basis, Datadog finds itself in the right place following the pandemic. Businesses are increasingly moving their presence online and their data into the cloud. That plays in perfectly with the company's application-monitoring software and real-time unified data platform. According to a forecast from Gartner, the observability market alone is a $62 billion addressable opportunity by 2026.</p>
        <p>But what really makes Datadog tick is its success in gaining big businesses as customers. Though it has an impressive 23,200 total customers, it's the 47% year-over-year growth in the number of clients with $1 million (or more) in annual recurring revenue that's really driving profits at Datadog. Between landing these big fish and seeing existing clients add onto their initial purchase, Datadog has had no trouble sustaining a 25%-plus annual growth rate.</p>
        <p>If you need one more solid reason to pay the premium for Datadog, consider this: Enterprise cloud spending accounted for roughly 8% of global information technology spending in 2021. By 2026, it's estimated to be closer to 20%. Datadog is built to help businesses with their cloud migration, so don't expect its growth rate to slow anytime soon.</p>
        <h3>Cresco Labs</h3>
        <p>A fourth magnificent growth stock you'll regret not adding on the Nasdaq bear market swoon is U.S. marijuana stock Cresco Labs (CRLBF 6.29%). Even though cannabis reform legislation continues to stall in Congress, multi-state operators (MSOs) like Cresco have more than enough catalysts to push into the green.</p>
        <p>As of March 8, 2023, Cresco Labs had 63 operating dispensaries in 10 states. Though 28 of these stores are located in medical marijuana-legal Florida, the company has been spending a lot of its effort pushing into limited-license markets, such as Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. States where regulators limit retail license issuance offer a level playing ground for relatively smaller MSOs like Cresco Labs to build up their brands and grow their following.</p>
        <p>Then again, Cresco Labs may not be "relatively small" for much longer. It's currently in the process of acquiring MSO Columbia Care in an all-share deal. Inclusive of the one dozen facilities being divested to satisfy regulators, the combined company would entail more than 130 operating dispensaries spanning 18 legalized states. Cost synergies should allow this new Cresco to be even more efficient over time.</p>
        <p>Yet the unsung hero of Cresco's operations might be its wholesale segment. While wholesale cannabis margins notably trail retail cannabis, Cresco holds a key advantage when it comes to volume. Thanks to its acquisition of Origin House in January 2020, it holds one of only a few cannabis distribution licenses in California. This allows it to place its proprietary products into hundreds of dispensaries throughout the Golden State.</p>
        <h3>Okta</h3>
        <p>The fifth astonishing growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is cybersecurity company Okta (OKTA 1.74%). In spite of higher-than-expected integration costs following the acquisition of Auth0, Okta looks to be on the path to recurring profits and sustained double-digit sales growth.</p>
        <p>Before getting into company specifics, it's important to recognize that the cybersecurity industry has become something of a necessity service. As businesses move their data into the cloud and develop an online presence, they're becoming evermore reliant on third-party security solutions. Since hackers don't take a day off, neither does demand for cybersecurity solutions.</p>
        <p>Okta specializes in identity verification solutions. The company's platform is cloud-based and relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning to grow more effective over time. Whereas on-premises security solutions have their limitations, Okta can effectively be layered for ongoing monitoring and authorization of users.</p>
        <p>The biggest catalyst moving forward is simply Okta putting its one-time integration costs from buying Auth0 in the rearview mirror. A cleaner income statement in the current fiscal year, coupled with Auth0 breaking down borders and giving Okta an opportunity to expand its revenue channels into Europe, should be a positive for existing shareholders.</p>
        <p>With Okta generating record operating cash flow of $76 million during the fourth quarter and ending the fiscal year (Jan. 31, 2023) with just over $3 billion in subscription backlog, the arrow appears to be pointing higher for long-term investors.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Policy-sensitive Treasury notes fell, sending two-year yields back above 4%, as a solid hiring report bolstered bets for another Federal Reserve rate increase. US stock futures advanced before closing early as the report eased concerns the economy was headed for recession.</p>
        <p>Contracts on the S&P 500 climbed, while the two-year yield jumped 15 basis points to 4.02% after March’s hiring report showed resiliency in the labor market that could enable the Fed to make policy more restrictive. Payroll additions topped 200,000, wage-growth slowed and the unemployment rate dropped.</p>
        <p>“This payrolls info is still indicating that the job market is on solid ground, but the magnitude of the payrolls gain relative to expectations is not significant enough for the Fed to dramatically shift course,” George Cipolloni, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, said. “Wage growth was as expected. I do not see much here that should make the Fed move off of their current path.”</p>
        <p>The cash equity markets are closed in the US for the Good Friday holiday, and futures stopped trading at 9:15 a.m. in New York. Treasuries opened for a shortened session, with the recommended close at noon. European markets were mostly shuttered.</p>
        <p>Swaps trading showed the odds for a quarter percentage point interest-rate increase at the Fed’s May meeting rose to about two in three, up from roughly 50-50 before the data landed. Investors have been aggressively pricing in rate cuts later this year as economic data falls short of estimates, suggesting the American economy is slowing.</p>
        <p>Data Thursday indicated filings for jobless claims rose more than expected, a day after a private reading on hiring came in below estimates. Job openings also contracted more than forecast, adding to worries that the labor market was softening.</p>
        <p>The next major data point for the Fed is a report on consumer prices, due April 12. Officials deliver their policy move on May 3.</p>
        <p>“While this is an employment report not likely to cause alarm, there is still no evidence policy is tight enough to slow demand in a meaningful way, either,” Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial wrote in an email. “There are other things going on in the world, of course, including credit tightening in the aftermath of recent bank failures. It will all go into the mix.”</p>
        <p>The two-year Treasury yield peaked above 5% just before last month’s banking stress and then plunged as worries mounted that tighter lending will constrict growth at the same time the Fed’s aggressive tightening filters through to the real economy.</p>
        <p>Read: Bond Action Gets Crazy on Payroll Good Friday, Stocks Less So</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 concluded its first losing week in the past four as data Thursday showed filings for jobless claims surpassed estimates last week, a day after a private payrolls report indicated hiring slowed more than forecast.</p>
        <p>US stocks bounced back from early losses on Thursday after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he didn’t think tighter credit conditions stemming from the recent banking turmoil would tip the economy into recession. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund warned that its outlook for global economic growth over the next five years is the weakest in more than three decades, urging nations to avoid economic fragmentation caused by geopolitical tension and take steps to bolster productivity.</p>
        <p>The yen fluctuated after declining Thursday against the dollar for the first time this week. While much of Asia including Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore was closed for holidays, financial markets in Japan and mainland China were open. Japan’s benchmark Topix edged higher, ending a two-day slump, and shares in China and South Korea advanced.</p>
        <p>Money Markets</p>
        <p>The cash pile parked at money-market funds hit a fresh record high in the past week, although inflows slowed from the recent breakneck pace. About $49.1 billion poured into US money-market funds in the week to April 5, bringing total assets to an unprecedented $5.25 trillion, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.</p>
        <p>Money-market funds have been scooping up cash recently. Initially much of that flow was driven by more attractive rates, but concern about the steadiness of some smaller lenders helped turbocharge that within the past month.</p>
        <p>Some of the main moves in markets:</p>
        <p>Stocks</p>
        <ul>
          <li>S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% as of 9:15 a.m. in New York</li>
          <li>Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.1%.</li>
          <li>The Topix gained 0.3%, while the Nikkei 225 added 0.2%</li>
          <li>The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3% and the CSI 300 gained 0.6%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bonds</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The two-year Treasury yield rose 15 basis points to 4.02%</li>
          <li>The 10-year rate added nine basis points to 3.39%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Currencies</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The euro was slipped to $1.09</li>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Wednesday amid uncertainty over the outlook for the world economy as reports on job openings and factory orders in the US heightened recession fears.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.45% to 7,668 points during midday trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was flat at 7,339 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) slipped 0.21% to 15,571.</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the red ahead of the opening bell.</p>
        <p>Wall Street sank and oil prices held steady Tuesday as new data showed fresh signs of labour market cooling and declining factory orders from businesses.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.59% to close at 33,402 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.58% to finish at 4,100 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) slipped 0.52% to 12,126.</p>
        <p>On the economic front, vacancies at US employers fell to 9.93 million from 10.5 million, a bigger fall than expected. On the other hand, quits were up and layoffs were down, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Separately, factory orders fell 0.3%, also lower than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Some economists view the slowdown in the number of open job positions as "progress" to reaching the Fed's goal of an equilibrium between supply and demand in the labour market.</p>
        <p>"While the Fed will welcome the softening in the data, officials will put much more stock in Friday's employment report and will continue to raise rates at the coming meetings to ensure further progress is made toward softer labour market conditions and lower inflation," Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.68% to 27,813 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong tumbled 0.66% to 20,274. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) gained ground, rising 0.49% to 3,312 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, the FTSE was being aided the banking sector after Barclays (BARC.L) rose 1.79% and Lloyds (LLOY.L) lifted 1.20%.</p>
        <p>The index was led by the United Utilities Group (UU.L), up 2.98%.</p>
        <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: "Markets are drifting as investor thoughts start to turn towards the scale of severity, as the likelihood of a recession later in the year in the US increases.</p>
        <p>"Further evidence of a slowing economy came in the form of releases showing factory orders which dropped for a second month and, in particular, as job openings fell to the lowest level in almost two years. The resilience of the labour market to date has kept the Federal Reserve on high alert in its battle against inflation, and most recent data has tended to suggest that the interest rate hiking policy is now taking a measured effect on crimping growth."</p>
        <p>Hunter added that as traders begin to rein in any new positions ahead of the long Easter weekend, markets were finding little reason to make any progress.</p>
        <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) was down against the dollar, trading around $1.24, after rallying the previous session. Investors are waiting on the latest UK PMI data, which can have a knock down effect on the sterling.</p>
        <p>The same against the euro, with sterling (GBPEUR=X) hovering around €1.14.</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) stopped its climb was trading at around $85/barrel, after rebounding demand in the US after data revealed that US crude stockpiles decreased by more than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Supply side concerns are also pushing prices higher, driven by the recent output cut decision by OPEC and other oil-producing countries.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished higher this Friday as the UK economy grew by more than first thought in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.29% to close at 7,642 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1% to 7,336 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) gained 0.83% to 15,652.</p>
        <h3>UK avoids recession</h3>
        <p>Revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed that the UK economy avoided recession in the second half of last year, posting 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The economy shrank in the third quarter of last year, but Friday’s data confirmed that the economy did not shrink for two successive quarters, which is the technical definition of recession.</p>
        <p>Gabriella Dickens at Pantheon Macroeconomics noted the UK is still is the only G7 economy in which GDP has not yet recovered to the same level as quarter four of 2019, before the pandemic struck.</p>
        <p>“Indeed, GDP still was 0.6% lower than it was three years ago in the UK, whereas it was 5.1% higher in the US, 2.9% higher in Canada, 0.8% in Japan, 1.2% in France, 1.9% in Italy and just back in line in Germany,” she said.</p>
        <p>The dominant services sector grew by 0.1%, boosted by a jump of nearly 11% for travel agents.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing was up by 0.5%, driven by the pharmaceutical sector, and construction grew 1.3%.</p>
        <p>ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy performed a little more strongly in the latter half of last year than previously estimated, with later data showing telecommunications, construction and manufacturing all faring better than initially thought in the latest quarter."</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Wall Street pushed higher on Friday as the final trading day of an eventful first quarter got underway.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.73% to 33,098 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.77% to 4,082 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 0.99% to 12,132.</p>
        <p>Stock futures perked up on Friday morning after inflation data showed further cooling in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.</p>
        <p>In February, "core" PCE, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy, rose 0.3% over the prior month and 4.6% over last year, with the annual increase coming in below Wall Street expectations for a 4.7% rise.</p>
        <p>A slowdown in inflation could ease pressure the Federal Reserve feels to continue with its rate-hiking campaign, which Fed officials earlier this week suggested will likely continue this spring given price increases that remain too high and a bank crisis that has shown signs of ebbing.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.93% to 28,041 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong rose 0.74% to 20,459. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, rising 0.36% to 3,272 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado Group (OCDO.L) rose 2.27% after it said had "comprehensively won" the patent infringement suit brought by AutoStore (AUTO.OL).</p>
        <p>Miner Rio Tinto (RIO.L) rose 0.86% after signing a joint venture with Canada's First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) to develop the La Granja copper project in Peru.</p>
        <p>Rolls-Royce (RR.L) saw shares jump after it announced a new chief financial officer (CFO). The new boss of Rolls-Royce hired Helen McCabe from his alma mater BP (BP.L) as CFO. However, the stock was trading at a loss in afternoon trading and closed 0.69% lower.</p>
        <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) was flat against the dollar, trading around $1.23.</p>
        <p>It was also weaker against the euro, with sterling (GBPEUR=X) hovering around €1.13.</p>
        <p>Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, said: “The pound is set to be the best-performing currency of the first quarter of 2023, having gained 2.5% against the dollar”.</p>
        <p>“Along with the improvement in the economic outlook, sterling is definitely drawing benefits from the market’s conviction that the Bank of England will need to continue raising rates.”</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $79 per barrel, as traders await the release of the personal consumption expenditures index on Friday, an indicator of US inflation that is certain to move oil prices.</p>
        <p>Fear of supply disruptions continues to dominate the global oil market, so Brent is set to end the week higher despite the volatility.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were higher on Tuesday after the banking industry turmoil of the past few weeks but the rally seemed to be losing steam</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was near parity at 7,476 points during midday trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was also muted at 7,1080 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) was flat at 15,138.</p>
        <h3>Bank of England</h3>
        <p>Bank of England (BoE) governor Andrew Bailey said a wave of early retirements could force up inflation, leading to higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the London School of Economics on Monday evening, Bailey said that a sharp decline in the number of people in the workforce was “part of the reason why we have had to raise Bank Rate by as much as we have”.</p>
        <p>That trend, he warned, will drive up prices and mean borrowing costs may need to be higher.</p>
        <p>He said: “We should expect this to put upward pressure on inflation in a way that would call for a higher level of interest rates to dampen demand.”</p>
        <p>Bailey said the rise in inactivity of people aged 50 to 64 was “particularly striking”.</p>
        <p>Bailey said the BoE had not already decided that interest rates needed to increase further but noted that inflation of 10.4% in February was “much too high”. He stressed that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would assess the “emerging evidence” before opting to lift rates again.</p>
        <p>Last week, the BoE raised the Bank rate toto 4.25% — its highest level since 2008.</p>
        <p>The European Central Bank, US Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank have also all raised interest rates this month.</p>
        <p>Markets are also taking note of Bailey speaking at the Treasury Select committee about the Silicon Valley UK arm's collapse.</p>
        <p>The governor of the Bank of England has said that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the quickest seen since Barings Bank failed in 1995.</p>
        <p>Andrew Bailey told MPs that the UK subsidiary of the Californian lender experienced a 30% run on its deposits in a single day as panic spread through markets and savers.</p>
        <p>Despite the run, Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm as able to meet those requests, which made its sale process to HSBC (HSBA.L) easier.</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the green ahead of the opening bell.</p>
        <p>Wall Street finished mixed on Monday, as bank stocks moved upward after North Carolina-based First Citizens (FCNCA) bank agreed to buy most of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.60% to close at 32,432 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.16% to finish at 3,977 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) lost 0.47% to 11,768.</p>
        <p>Banks will dominate the headlines again this week with the earnings and economic calendars in sight. The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on bank failures on Tuesday, with the witness list including FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg, Federal Reserve vice chairman Michael Barr, and Treasury undersecretary Nellie Liang.</p>
        <p>Barr wrote in a statement ahead of the hearing on Monday that the failure of SVB reeked of "mismanagement."</p>
        <p>"To begin, SVB's failure is a textbook case of mismanagement. The bank had a concentrated business model, serving the technology and venture capital sector," Barr's testimony reads.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) rose 0.15% to 27,518 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong climbed 1.10% to 19,782. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) lost ground, falling 0.18% to 3,245 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, Ocado Group (OCDO.L) lost 4.39% after Ocado Retail, despite its joint venture with Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) reporting a rise in revenue.</p>
        <p>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "A relief ripple is helping stocks make some gains amid hopes that the volatility, which has wracked the banking sector, has eased off.</p>
        <p>“Right now, worries about the impact of banking turmoil are taking a back seat and the Bank of England is intent on steering consumer prices lower. Governor Andrew Bailey stressed in his speech in London last night that interest rates may have to move higher if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressure.”</p>
        <p>Spirits maker Diageo (DGE.L) has appointed its first female chief executive after announcing the retirement of Sir Ivan Menezes after a decade in the top job.</p>
        <p>Debra Crew will step up from her current position as chief operating officer and lead the FTSE 100-listed business from 1 July.</p>
        <p>Across the wider FTSE 250 index (^FTMC), gambling company William Hill (888.L) has been hit by a record £19.2m ($23.6m) fine by the UK gambling regulator.</p>
        <p>Three gambling businesses owned by the company will pay the sum for "widespread and alarming" social responsibility and anti-money laundering failures, the Gambling Commission said.</p>
        <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) gained ground against the dollar at over $1.23. Sterling (GBPEUR=X) rose nearly 0.15% against the euro, trading near €1.14.</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) climbed and was trading at around $78 per barrel, with markets focused on developments in the banking crisis and indications of strengthening demand in China.</p>
        <p>"Though risks remain in the banking system amid the recent event, dip-buys in crude oil could be the prevailing trend in the near term," said Tina Teng, analyst at CMC Markets.</p>

        <p>The Nasdaq Composite losing a third of its value is the perfect excuse for opportunistic investors to pounce on high-quality growth stocks.</p>
        <p>As much as we'd like the stock market to move higher and never falter, it's important to recognize that corrections, crashes, and bear markets are a normal part of the long-term investing cycle. Last year, all three of the major U.S. stock indexes plunged into a bear market, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) getting hit hardest -- a 33% decline when the finish line was crossed.</p>
        <p>While bear markets can be unpleasant in the short run and tug on investors' heartstrings, they're also, historically, the ideal time for patient investors to pounce. Even though we can't consistently forecast when a bear market will begin, how long it'll last, or how steep the decline will be, we do know that all previous bear markets have eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally. In other words, bear market volatility is a red-carpet invitation for opportunistic investors.</p>
        <p>With growth stocks taking it on the chin, they're a logical place for long-term investors to look for bargains. What follows are five jaw-dropping growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
        <h3>CrowdStrike Holdings</h3>
        <p>The first awe-inspiring growth stock that's ripe for the picking during the Nasdaq bear market decline is end-user cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -2.23%). Though recessionary fears have weighed on CrowdStrike in the short run, it's well positioned with clear-cut competitive advantages over the long term.</p>
        <p>On a macro basis, investors should be aware that cybersecurity solutions have evolved into basic necessity services. Hackers and robots don't take vacation days just because the U.S. economy hits a speed bump. Businesses of all sizes with an online and/or cloud-based presence are increasingly relying on third-party providers like CrowdStrike to protect their sensitive data.</p>
        <p>The engine that powers CrowdStrike's incredible growth is Falcon, the company's cloud-native platform that's reliant on artificial intelligence (AI). Falcon is overseeing trillions of weekly events, which is helping it become smarter at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time. Despite CrowdStrike's services being costlier than its peers', the company's gross retention rate of 98% speaks volumes about Falcon's efficacy.</p>
        <p>Although CrowdStrike hasn't had any trouble gaining new subscribers, the most intriguing aspect of its ascension is the add-on sales from existing clients. Six years ago, a single-digit percentage of its 450 clients had purchased four or more cloud-module subscriptions. Today, 62% of its more than 23,000 subs have purchased five or more cloud-module subscriptions. These add-on sales are the key reason CrowdStrike's subscription gross margin is near 80%.</p>
        <h3>Fiverr International</h3>
        <p>A second stellar growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (FVRR -0.38%). Despite near-term worries of a possible U.S. recession weakening the labor market, Fiverr has three key catalysts it brings to the table.</p>
        <p>To start with, the labor market has been permanently shifted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some people have returned to the office, more are choosing to work remotely than ever before. This means Fiverr's freelancer marketplace is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this structural change in the workforce.</p>
        <p>Another reason Fiverr stands out is the way its freelancers market their work. Whereas pricing tasks on an hourly basis is commonplace at competing online-service marketplaces, Fiverr freelancers price their work as a package. The price transparency of Fiverr's platform is helping to push both spend per buyer and the aggregate number of buyers higher.</p>
        <p>The third differentiating factor is Fiverr's take-rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform that it gets to keep. Most competing freelancer marketplaces keep around 15% of the revenue tied to negotiated deals. Fiverr's take-rate continues to climb and hit 30.2% during the fourth quarter.  Fiverr isn't scaring away buyers or freelancers, and a 30%-plus take-rate shows it'll be substantially more profitable than its peers.</p>
        <h3>Intuitive Surgical</h3>
        <p>The third jaw-dropping growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying on the Nasdaq bear market plunge is robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 4.89%). Though COVID-19 has caused some optional surgical procedures to be pushed to a later date, Intuitive Surgical's dominance of the robotic-assisted surgical landscape, along with its operating model, sets this company up for long-term success.</p>
        <p>As of the end of 2022, Intuitive Surgical had installed 7,544 of its da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals and surgical centers worldwide.  While this might sound like a pedestrian figure, it's far more than its competitors. For a two-decade stretch, da Vinci was one of the only soft-tissue assistive surgical systems available.</p>
        <p>What's more, it takes a considerable amount of time to train surgeons to use da Vinci, and it's pricey to purchase these systems -- $500,000 to $2,500,000 per system. The tangible expense and opportunity cost associated with purchasing a da Vinci surgical system makes it highly unlikely that hospitals or surgical centers will switch to a competing device.</p>
        <p>However, the real lure is Intuitive Surgical's razor-and-blades operating model. The company's da Vinci operating system may be pricey, but it's intricate to build and generates only mediocre margins. But once Intuitive has clients locked into its surgical system, it generates copious amounts of high-margin revenue by selling instruments with each procedure and servicing its systems. As time passes, these higher-margin sales channels are becoming a larger percentage of total revenue.</p>
        <h3>Fastly</h3>
        <p>A fourth marvelous growth stock you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq bear market swoon is edge computing company Fastly (FSLY 0.56%). In spite of ongoing losses, new leadership appears to have Fastly on the fast track to sustained double-digit sales growth and eventual profits.</p>
        <p>Fastly is best known for its work as a content-delivery network. It's tasked with getting data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible. Both the rise of the metaverse and the hybrid work environment in the wake of the pandemic are catalysts that can increase the amount of data traversing Fastly's network. Since this is a usage-based network, more data movement equates to more revenue for Fastly.</p>
        <p>Although its growth rate has slowed a bit, the vast majority of Fastly's key performance metrics remain rock solid. Its total customer count has grown by 500 over a seven-quarter stretch (21 months, ended Dec. 31, 2022), with average enterprise customer spend (over the last 12 months) increasing by 11% to $782 over that same span. More importantly, Fastly's dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) is climbing, once again, and hit 123% during the fourth quarter. A DBNER of 123% implies that existing clients spent 23% more during the fourth quarter than they did in the comparable quarter last year.</p>
        <p>Lastly, new CEO Todd Nightingale should inspire confidence in shareholders. Nightingale was hired to tighten the belt at money-losing Fastly, further innovation, and keep the customer count needle moving in the right direction.  Nightingale is, thus far, firing on all cylinders in his young tenure.</p>
        <h3>Baidu</h3>
        <p>The fifth jaw-dropping growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is China's leading internet search provider Baidu (BIDU 3.55%). Though multiple headwinds have held Baidu back for the past three years, many of these hurdles have now been lifted.</p>
        <p>For example, China's zero-COVID mitigation strategy resulted in unpredictable and stringent lockdowns that crippled supply chains for most sectors and industries. With China removing its stringent COVID-19 restrictions, the country's economy is free to thrive once again. Though it could take a few quarters for China's residents to build up immunity to COVID-19, moving beyond the zero-COVID strategy will benefit the country and Baidu.</p>
        <p>What makes Baidu such a phenomenal stock to buy is its dominance of the Chinese internet search space. As of February, it accounted for approximately 56% of all search share in its home market. This makes it the go-to choice for advertisers wanting to target their message(s) and logically gives the company strong ad-pricing power.</p>
        <p>But don't overlook AI as a major future growth driver for Baidu. In addition to the company's recently released AI-powered chatbot, known as Ernie Bot, Baidu AI cloud services and AI-based intelligent driving solutions are delivering double-digit sales growth in the company's nonmarketing sales channel. </p>
        <p>With economic activity in China ramping back up, Baidu stock remains reasonably cheap at 13 times Wall Street's forward-year consensus earnings.</p>

        <p>The Dow Jones dropped 300 points Friday on renewed banking fears. Deutsche Bank dived 10% as the bank's credit default swaps surged.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dropped 300 points Friday on renewed banking fears. U.S. shares of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) plunged more than 10% after concerned investors drove the bank's credit default swaps, which insure against bond failure, to a four-year high. The panic sent investors fleeing into bonds, driving yields lower. Meanwhile, energy stocks crowded the bottom of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 as oil prices swooned.</p>
        <p>Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 1.4% while Citigroup (C) declined 1.8%. And Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 1.7%. The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) dropped 2.1%, with First Republic Bank (FRC) down more than 4%. (For our latest coverage of the market's action, go to our Stock Market Today page.)</p>
        <p>On the economic front, February durable goods orders from the Commerce Department fell 1% for the month. Wall Street saw durable goods orders rising 1.5% for the month vs. January's 4.5% drop. Further, the S&P Global's preliminary Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing and Services Indexes for March came out.</p>
        <p>The manufacturing index posted a better-than-expected 49.3 reading vs. the 47.2 estimates, while the services index measured 53.8, higher than the 50.3 estimate.</p>
        <p>Finally, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is scheduled to speak around the market open Friday.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
        <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) declined 1.7% Friday, following a modest recall in China and after Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management dumped $26.8 million worth of Tesla shares on Thursday. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were lower after today's stock market open.</p>
        <p>Align Technology (ALGN), IBD SwingTrader stock Meta Platforms (META) and IBD Leaderboard Palo Alto Networks (PANW) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Nike and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the top stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market correction.</p>
        <p>Palo Alto is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Microsoft is featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. And Meta is an IBD SwingTrader stock. Palo Alto, Align, Microsoft and Meta were all recent IBD Stock Of The Day subjects.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
        <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which does not track oil or financial stocks, dropped 0.3% in morning action.</p>
        <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.8% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) moved down 0.7% early Friday.</p>
        <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Thursday slipped to 3.4%, falling sharply for a second-straight session. The 10-year yield is near its lowest level since early February. On Friday, the 10-year continued lower, falling to 3.29%.</p>
        <p>U.S. oil prices shifted sharply lower, as West Texas Intermediate traded down 3.6% to just above $67 a barrel. WTI futures are defending a mild gain for the week, after touching their lowest level since November 2021 on Monday.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Correction</h3>
        <p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rallied as much as 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively, before closing with modest gains of 0.2% and 0.3%. Both briefly turned lower in afternoon trade before a late-day bounce. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shrank an early 2.5% gain down to 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was a laggard, reversing 0.4% lower.</p>
        <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "The stock market ended higher but well off session highs Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen established that the U.S. government is ready to take 'additional action if warranted' to stabilize the banking sector."</p>
        <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column amid the ongoing stock market correction.</p>

        <p>Since bottoming on Oct. 3, Nike shares have rallied as much as 59% to their recent high at 131.31. Now the stock is consolidating within a flat base that offers a 131.41 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition.</p>
        <p>Amid Thursday's 1.2% gain, the stock is again consolidating back below its 50-day moving average, a key benchmark. NKE stock moved down 0.7% early Friday.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Dow Jones leader Salesforce showed big upside strength after strong fourth-quarter results. The stock is now above a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry after recent big gains. Still, the market is in a correction, so investors should avoid new purchases until the market environment improves. CRM stock fell 0.4% early Friday.</p>
        <h3>Top Stocks To Watch: Align, Meta, Palo Alto</h3>
        <p>Align Technology continues to trace a consolidation that has multiple buy points: a 357.10 early entry and a conventional entry at 368.97. Shares fell 0.7% Friday morning.</p>
        <p>Backstory: The company makes clear teeth-straightening systems called Invisalign. UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo says investors recently regained confidence in Align stock, which has surged 50% this year. December-ended quarter results from Align and its competitors, management commentary, U.S. economic data and a recent uptick in demand for Invisalign cases support this view, he said in a note to clients.</p>
        <p>Backstory: Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over macroeconomic concerns, recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.</p>
        <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Palo Alto Networks reclaimed its 192.94 buy point out of a cup with handle during Thursday's 1.6% move higher. The buy area runs up to 202.59. PANW stock traded down 0.6% Friday.</p>
        <p>Backstory: Through acquisitions, Palo Alto Networks has expanded into endpoint security and vulnerability management. Endpoint tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.</p>
        <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
        <p>Tesla stock rose 0.6% Thursday, bouncing a bit after Wednesday's 3.25% skid. Shares continue to rebound from their 50-day moving average. Shares closed Thursday around 50% off their 52-week high.</p>
        <p>TSLA stock lost 1.7% Friday morning, as it threatened to give up Thursday's gains.</p>
        <p><strong>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</strong></p>
        <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares climbed 0.7% Thursday, recovering a large part of Wednesday's decline. AAPL stock fell 0.4% Friday.</p>
        <p>Microsoft shares are again trying to break out above a flat base's 276.86 buy point with a 2% gain Thursday. MSFT stock lost 0.6% early Friday.</p>
        <p>Microsoft shares surged last week after the company announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications. That follows the company's investments in AI startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzy ChatGPT application.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished mixed this Thursday as the Bank of England raised interest rates to 4.25%.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 0.69% to close at 7,515 points , while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.22% to 7,146 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.14% to 15,237.</p>
        <h3>Bank of England's interest rate hike</h3>
        <p>The Bank of England (BoE) has raised the UK interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 4.25% to combat double-digit inflation.</p>
        <p>This is the 11th time in a row in less than 18 months that the central bank has increased rates, making borrowing costs higher despite the cost of living crisis that has hit UK households.</p>
        <p>It lifts UK interest rates to their highest since October 2008, early in the financial crisis, when Bank Rate was 4.5%.</p>
        <p>Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: “The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee was right to raise interest rates by 25bps at its meeting today. It is possible that recent concerns in the global banking sector will serve to tighten credit conditions, but that is not guaranteed. As with the ECB last week and Fed last night, the Bank of England acted on the information it had today which is that the economy is still resilient, inflation is uncomfortably high and broadening, and wage growth is at a level that is inconsistent with a 2% inflation target.</p>
        <p>“We are concerned that the Bank will find itself outside of the central bank herd in the second half of the year. This is because the persistence of inflation appears more worrying in the UK than elsewhere, reflecting the fact that the combination of Brexit, the pandemic and an energy crisis appears to have done more lasting damage to the supply side of the economy.</p>
        <p>Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist, BlackRock Investment Institute, added: “The Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.25%, in line with our expectations – recent upside surprises in inflation show that we’re yet to see the back of the problem. The increase follows the Federal Reserve and ECB rate rises in recent days, and shows why we’re in a new regime; central banks will not ride to the rescue with rate cuts at the first sign of growth concerns, as we’ve been used to for a generation. Financial stability (stabilising the system given banking concerns, or in the UK’s case last year, the gilt yield spike) and monetary policy actions (dealing with inflation) are distinct.</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Wall Street opened higher Thursday after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled its rate hiking campaign may be nearing an end amid concerns about stability in the global banking system.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 1.16% to 32,402 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 1.36% to 3,990 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 2% to 11,902.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate 0.25% to a 4.75%-5% target range, citing some additional policy firming may be appropriate. Additionally, the Fed said it would continue the same pace of reducing treasury and mortgage-backed security holdings.</p>
        <p>"On net, we think the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) episode and the fallout for the broader regional banking sector will work to slow credit, economic activity, and eventually inflation, resulting in the Fed needing to do less of the heavy lifting to tighten financial conditions," Tiffany Wilding, PIMCO North American economist, wrote in a statement following Powell's press conference.</p>
        <p>Although the Fed did lift US interest rates by a quarter-point, it also dropped its regular warning that “ongoing increases” in Fed Funds rate would be needed.</p>
        <p>“In other words, the Fed has toned down its statement to give it flexibility to pause the interest rate hiking cycle in May depending on incoming economic data,” saidMatthew Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com and City Index.</p>
        <p>Powell also moved to calm banking sector fears in the wake insisting that depositor funds were "safe" in the US banking system.</p>
        <p>The Fed chair said the measures taken in response to the failures, including a guarantee for all deposits held at the two lenders and a new Fed lending facility, "demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe".</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 0.17% to 27,419 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 2.05% to 19,993. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, rising 0.64% to 3,286 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, the blue chip was in the red as banks lost as much as 1.1% after two straight days of gains.</p>
        <p>Schroders (SDR.L) led the losses, down 3.52%, with HSBC (HSBA.L) tumbling 2.35%, and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) falling by 2.70%.</p>
        <p>Informa (INF.L) dropped 2.25% after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the events organizer's stock to "equal-weight" from "overweight".</p>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) touched its highest level since the start of February this morning, as the City was right to anticipate another rise in UK interest rates.</p>
        <p>The pound reached $1.2325, up 0.5%, as the dollar slipped following last night’s Federal Reserve decision.</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) bounced back and was trading at around $76/barrel amid optimism around China's demand.</p>

        <h3>In this article</h3>
        <p>Britain’s FTSE 100 plunged by nearly 2 per cent in early morning trading on Monday despite UBS’s £2.7 billion rescue deal to save troubled lender Credit Suisse.</p>
        <p>The takeover, announced on Sunday night, failed to convince spooked investors concerned about another meltdown in the global banking system, with 129 points shaved off the value of the 100 biggest firms listed in the UK.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 250 was also down 1 per cent, with banking stocks across the two indexes slumping by 5.3 per cent.</p>
        <p>By 2pm in London, the FTSE 100 was around 0.6 per cent higher for the session, with early session gains seen also on the Dow Jones and S&P 500 on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, market worries continued to particularly hit other banking stocks, which led the fallers in London and Europe’s other key markets.</p>
        <p>The recent collapse of US-headquartered Silicon Valley Bank has continued to send shockwaves through the banking sector, bringing back grim memories of the 2008 financial crash which had major implications for economies across the globe.</p>
        <p>Regulators in Washington - and in London, where SVB had a UK division - stepped in to guarantee customer deposits in the failed tech lender but the moves have so far failed to calm market jitters.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse, founded in 1856 and which had managed more than £1 trillion in assets, has had troubles for years but appears to have been tipped over the age by SVB’s collapse.</p>
        <p>It was hoped that the sale of the Swiss bank - the country’s second-biggest lender and viewed by some analysts as ‘too important to fail’ - would calm anxieties in the markets but there was no evidence of that on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Markets in Asia were struggling earlier in the morning, with shares in Hong Kong falling by more than 3 per cent as the banking sector took a battering.</p>
        <p>“With Credit Suisse shareholders and some bondholders taking a huge hit, banks in Asia have taken a hit on similar concerns about (some of their) bond-holding values,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</p>
        <p>“While the weekend deal still presents the Swiss National Bank and Swiss Government with untold headaches, with the size of the newly merged bank set to dwarf the size of the Swiss economy.</p>
        <p>“The phrase too big to fail really does spring to mind here, and this morning’s weakness in Asia markets serves to reinforce concerns about these types of writedowns and any spillover effects on the rest of the banking sector.”</p>
        <p>The Credit Suisse deal was announced on Sunday evening, as UBS agreed to pay around £2.7 billion for its former rival. The deal was brokered by the same Swiss regulators which had on Wednesday said they would lend up to £45 billion to Credit Suisse to keep it afloat.</p>
        <p>“Having come off the worst week for European equity markets this year, volatility looks set to continue this week now that the fate of Credit Suisse appears to have finally been sealed,” Mr Hewson said.</p>
        <p>UBS’s merger was welcomed internationally, with the US Federal Reserve and Treasury saying Switzerland had moved to “support financial stability”. British chancellor Jeremy Hunt and the Bank of England have also hailed the deal.</p>
        <p>The 167-year-old Credit Suisse was brought to the brink of financial calamity last week despite a £45bn emergency loan from Switzerland’s central bank.</p>
        <p>The deal was made in tandem with six major central banks, including the Bank of England, taking coordinated action to boost dollar flows to help stem the crisis of confidence gripping more lenders.</p>
        <p>The so-called swap line arrangement, involving the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Bank of Canada and Swiss National Bank (SNB) aimed to "enhance the provision of liquidity" and the "smooth functioning of US dollar funding markets".</p>
        <p>It was hoped that the seven-day-a-week facility, which is due to run until at least the end of April, will be enough to bolster market confidence over the health of other banks, particularly US regional lenders.</p>
        <p>Switzerland said the Credit Suisse deal, which was essentially forced on UBS, was aimed at shoring up confidence in the market.</p>
        <p>UBS’s own shares took a 12 per cent hit in the aftermath of the deal. Deutsche Bank was down 10 per cent, Barclays fell 6 per cent and Lloyds saw a tumble of 4 per cent.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse employs around 5,500 people in the UK, but authorities here were keen to stress on Sunday that the country’s financial system is still safe.</p>
        <p>The Bank of England said: "We welcome the comprehensive set of actions set out by the Swiss authorities today in order to support financial stability.</p>
        <p>"We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation.</p>
        <p>"The UK banking system is well capitalised and funded, and remains safe and sound."</p>
        <p>UBS said job losses were expected at Credit Suisse’s UK office after the historic sale of the Swiss bank, with an impact on the lender’s British workers seen as being “inevitable”.</p>
        <p>The former chief executive of UBS in the UK, Mark Yallop, said he thinks job losses will be “inevitable” as a result of the merger and chopping down the investment bank.</p>
        <p>He told the BBC’s Today programme: “The two firms together employ about 120,000 staff, of which about 11,000 sit in London, and I think it’s inevitable that a merger of this sort will result in some further job losses.</p>
        <p>“I would imagine those would be concentrated in the risky investment banking business at Credit Suisse which is partly the cause of the problems the firms is experiencing.</p>
        <p>“And in middle-office, technology and operational roles where bringing two firms together will mean you can run one bigger firm, without doubling up the infrastructure needed to manage it.”</p>

        <p>BEIJING (AP) — European shares advanced Thursday following a retreat in Asia after Credit Suisse said it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up its finances, possibly easing worries about a bank crisis following the failure of two U.S. lenders.</p>
        <p>London, Frankfurt and Wall Street futures gained. Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong declined as Asian bank stocks slid, reversing Wednesday's gains. Oil prices rose.</p>
        <p>Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 lost 0.7% on Wednesday after Credit Suisse shares fell 30%. That fueled jitters about global banks that are under strain following interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to cool inflation.</p>
        <p>“Expect confidence to remain fragile,” Chris Turner, Francesco Pesole and Frantisek Taborsky of ING said in a report.</p>
        <p>The turmoil over banks will complicate a European Central Bank decision due to be announced Thursday about another possible interest rate hike, they said. It is “casting doubts on whether policymakers will raise rates at all,” they said.</p>
        <p>In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London gained 1.4% to 7,447.53. The DAX in Frankfurt jumped 1.7% to 14,988.39 and the CAC 40 in Paris added 1.7% to 6,999.23. The Swiss Market index was up 1.2%.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&P 500 index was up 0.1%. That for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the Dow lost 0.9% and the Nasdaq composite closed up 0.1%.</p>
        <p>In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo retreated 0.8% to 27,010.61. Mizuho Bank was down 3.9%, while Resona Holdings, a major second-tier bank, lost 4.8%.</p>
        <p>The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 1.7% to 19,203.91. Standard Chartered Plc lost 5.4% and HSBC was 2.4% lower.</p>
        <p>The Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.1% to 3,226.89 after government data Wednesday showed the Chinese economy is recovering more slowly than expected following the lifting of anti-virus controls.</p>
        <p>Search engine Baidu's share price plunged 10% and eventually closed down 6.4% in Hong Kong after the company unveiled its rival to the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT in a pre-recorded rather than a live presentation.</p>
        <p>China's banks don't face the same pressures as foreign lenders because Beijing has held its benchmark lending rate steady since mid-2022 and keeps the country sealed off from global capital flows. State-owned Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Ltd. and Bank of China, Ltd. were up 0.1%.</p>
        <p>The Kospi in Seoul was off less than 0.1% at 2,377.91 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 sank 1.5% to 6,965.50.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse has been fighting troubles for years, including losses from the 2021 collapse of investment firm Archegos Capital.</p>
        <p>Its share price plunge reignited worries about the global industry after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed in the second- and third-biggest U.S. bank failures in history.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, bank stocks plunged Monday, recovered Tuesday and tumbled again Wednesday.</p>
        <p>First Republic Bank sank 21.4%, a day after soaring 27%. JPMorgan Chase slid 4.7%.</p>
        <p>Banks are struggling after the Federal Reserve's fastest series of rate hikes in decades caused prices of assets on their balance sheets to decline.</p>
        <p>Stress in the financial system could push the Fed to hold off on hiking rates at its meeting next week or at least refrain from the larger rate hike it had been potentially signaling. But inflation at 6% in February still is well above the Fed's 2% target.</p>
        <p>Weaker-than-expected economic reports released Wednesday may have allayed some of those worries.</p>
        <p>One showed that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by much more last month than economists expected. It’s still high at a 4.6% level versus a year earlier, but that was better than the 5.4% that was forecast.</p>
        <p>Other data showed that U.S. spending at retailers fell by more than expected last month. Such data could raise worries about a recession on the horizon, but they may also take some pressure off inflation in the near term.</p>
        <p>In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $68.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plummeted $3.72 on Wednesday to $67.61. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading advanced $1.05 cents to $74.74 per barrel in London. It lost $3.76 to $73.69 the previous session.</p>
        <p>The dollar declined to 132.87 yen from Wednesday's 133.46 yen. The euro gained to $1.0615 from $1.0586.</p>

        <h4>SINGAPORE, March 16 (Reuters) -</h4>
        <p>Markets took a moment's respite on Thursday after Credit Suisse said it would borrow as much as 50 billion francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss central bank to steady itself, but trade was very tense as investors worried where banking stress might show up next.</p>
        <p>Asian shares fell but without the frenzied drops seen overnight in Europe. European futures were last up 2%, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.5%.</p>
        <p>Any relief was tinged with fear of what may go wrong next.</p>
        <p>A week ago a start-up lender in California failed and now a systemic bank in one of Europe's financial capitals is in enough trouble to seek authorities' help. Credit Suisse shares dropped 24% on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Safe assets like bonds, gold and dollars were in favour.</p>
        <p>"I think we're getting into the hard hat territory again," said Damian Rooney, a dealer at Perth stockbroker Argonaut.</p>
        <p>"The word contagion is knocking about...we're getting fear across the whole board here," he said. "The trouble is with the unwinding - you don't know what you don't know."</p>
        <p>MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1% to its lowest this year. Japan's bank shares recovered some even deeper early losses, but were last down 4% and the Nikkei dropped 1.3%.</p>
        <p>Insurers, banks, miners and consumer stocks were among the biggest losers across Asia's markets as worries grow that a potential credit crunch can worsen a looming economic slowdown.</p>
        <p>Selling pressure eased for commodities and buying in gold, bonds and dollars backed off but without really recovering any of the losses in growth-exposed assets or handing back much of the astonishing gains that have been seen in bond markets.</p>
        <p>Bonds have soared while markets have radically re-priced the interest rate outlook, betting central banks will be quickly cutting rates while stability fears rattle the financial system.</p>
        <p>Two-year U.S. Treasuries are eying their best week since 1987 and yields, which fall when prices rise, are down more than 66 basis points since Friday.</p>
        <p>An index of bond market volatility - the ICE BofA MOVE index - has hit its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
        <p>'SOMETHING UGLY'</p>
        <p>The European Central Bank's meeting later on Thursday looms as a big test of the bond rally, as the first scheduled policy announcement since bank jitters began in the U.S. last week.</p>
        <p>ECB policymakers had flagged a 50 basis point hike and President Christine Lagarde was just this month saying it was very likely. But market pricing implies just a 10% chance of that happening now and traders are on edge about the outcome.</p>
        <p>"We've got to get through ECB and see how that goes down. And then the impact of that may well impact on what we think about the Fed next week," said ING economist Rob Carnell.</p>
        <p>"I think it's going to be a very volatile period until we get this out of the way...it feels like at these interest rate levels the risk of finding that you've lifted a stone and something ugly is underneath gets higher."</p>
        <p>The euro and Swiss franc found some support from the central bank's help for Credit Suisse, steadying after steep overnight drops.</p>
        <p>The euro last stood at $1.0601 and the franc at 0.9300 to the dollar. The flight to safety lent support to the yen and it rose about 0.5% to 132.75 per dollar.</p>
        <p>The New Zealand dollar fell 0.4% to $0.6161 after growth data missed forecasts.</p>
        <p>($1 = 0.9310 Swiss francs) ($1 = 0.9301 Swiss francs)</p>

        <p>Stocks were tumbling—until the Swiss National Bank offered to support  Credit Suisse Group CS –13.94%  if necessary. That news caused the market to bounce and hold an important level of technical support.</p>
        <p>The day began with Credit Suisse (CS) emerging as the latest bank to be the focus of investor concerns after the Saudi National Bank said it wouldn’t provide more financing. The news, which came after SVB’s collapse, caused the S&P 500 to tumble as much as 2.1%, to 3838.24, Wednesday and to give back nearly all of its year-to-date gains. But news that the Swiss National Bank would help support Credit Suisse caused stocks to bounce off their lows and the S&P 500SPX –0.70%  to close down just 0.7% at 3,891.93.</p>
        <p>“Bottom line, the introduction of regional bank contagion has altered the market landscape in the short term, and whether those risks settle or increase will determine if stocks stabilize,” writes Sevens Report’s Tom Essaye. </p>
        <p>Stabilize they did, and at an important level for the market. For the S&P 500, 3850 has been identified as an important support level for stocks, one, that if it broke, would lead to a further drop to the next support level, near 3700. And if that level were to break, the index could fall to its bear market low of just below 3600. In a worst-case scenario—or at least a bad one—the S&P 500 could fall to 3000, writes John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. </p>
        <p>That level would make sense from a fundamental perspective, too. More economic weakness from here—in addition to that created by the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes—would pressure earnings estimates, estimates that already look too high. Analyst’s aggregate 2023 earnings per share forecasts for S&P 500 companies sit at about $221 right now, according to FactSet, just above last year’s $216.</p>
        <p>But if the economy slows, estimates could get reduced to $210 or even lower as the market loses confidence in the economy and corporate earnings power. That alone would put the S&P 500 at about 3640 at a current based on the S&P 500’s current multiple of 17.3 times 12-month forward earnings.</p>
        <p>Declining earnings would likely mean declining valuations, writes Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, perhaps earning the S&P 500 a multiple as low as 14 times. At that level, the index would trade at 2940, down 24% from Wednesday’s close.</p>

        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished in the red this Monday as the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm (SIVB) led to a weak start to the week on the markets.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 2.25% to close at 7,574 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris tumbled 2.58% to 7,034 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 2.66% to 15,017.</p>
        <p>Across the pond, US stocks started off the week with a sour sentiment before bouncing back after federal banking regulators took aggressive actions to stem the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.47% to 32,060 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.49% to 3,880 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 1.13% to 11,264.</p>
        <p>President Joe Biden addressed the nation on Monday regarding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Biden said that “no losses will be borne by the taxpayers” and he assured customers that they would be protected. The president also vowed to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen rules for banks.</p>
        <p>Biden explained that he instructed his team to protect US workers and small businesses and detailed their actions to protect customers' deposits and not put taxpayer dollars at risk, to hold those responsible accountable, and not to protect investors in the bank.</p>
        <p>Back in London, HSBC (HSBA.L) bought the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank (SVBUK), securing the deposits of more than 3,000 customers worth £6.7bn ($8bn).</p>
        <p>The Treasury said the deal with HSBC involved no taxpayer money and the Bank of England said deposits were secure.</p>
        <p>HSBC said it paid just £1 for SVBUK after the bank failed on Friday.</p>
        <p>All SVBUK services will continue to operate as normal and customers should not notice any changes, the statement said.</p>
        <p>"This acquisition makes excellent strategic sense for our business in the UK," HSBC said.</p>
        <p>"It strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the UK and internationally," Noel Quinn, HSBC group chief executive, said.</p>
        <p>Silicon Valley Bank — which specialised in lending to technology companies — was shut down by US regulators on Friday in the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.</p>
        <p>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “Today the government and the Bank of England have facilitated a private sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK. This ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.</p>
        <p>“I am pleased we have reached a resolution in such short order.</p>
        <p>“HSBC is Europe’s largest bank, and SVBUK customers should feel reassured by the strength, safety and security that brings them.”</p>
        <p>"HSBC shareholders may have some concerns about the bank snapping up assets which have been under such a cloud of uncertainty, particularly the exposure to bonds, but HSBC says it expects a gain to arise from the acquisition.</p>
        <p>"This will be hugely welcomed by the government, given the looming crisis risked overshadowing budget day, as a big tech sector bailout would not have been a good look when millions have been told there is little extra money to ease the cost of living crisis."</p>
        <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: "It means that SVBUK will avoid insolvency proceedings and its customers will be able to access deposits and banking services as normal from today. European markets look set to open higher as a crisis in the banking sector is averted for now."</p>
        <p>Dom Hallas, executive director of Coadec, a lobby group representing UK tech start-ups, said Monday’s deal “saved hundreds of the UK’s most innovative companies".</p>
        <p>Financial stocks were among the fallers in London, with Standard Chartered (STAN.L) losing 6.52%, investment manager abrdn (ABDN.L) off 3.41%, and Barclays (BARC.L) falling 5.79%.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $82 per barrel amid concerns of further interest rate increases.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.11% to 27,832 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.98% to 19,702. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, climbing 1.20% to 3,268 points.</p>

        <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell Monday, while Nasdaq futures rose after a flurry of news Sunday evening. The FDIC and other financial regulators announced that all SVB Financial depositors would get access to all funds Monday, while also announcing a plan to limit the contagion. Regulators also closed embattled Signature Bank (SBNY).</p>
        <p>Treasury yields plummeted while Fed rate hike odds faded, but bank stocks continued to sell off, including such as First Republic Bank (FRC), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) as regulators stressed their would be no bailouts for shareholders.</p>
        <p>President Biden will speaking on the banking crisis at 9 a.m. ET.</p>
        <p>First Republic stock crashed more than 60% Monday morning, even after saying it got fresh funding from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan. Western Alliance also is off over 60% as well. Schwab lost 6% despite a Citigroup upgrade. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which found support on Friday, fell 1% even with a Wells Fargo upgrade. Bank of America (BAC) retreated 3%. The XLF financial ETF fell modestly and KRE regional bank ETF declined sharply.</p>
        <p>The stock market suffered big losses last week as SVB Financial (SIVB) and crypto bank Silvergate Financial (SI) collapsed, triggering intense losses for bank stocks. The major indexes sold off hard, breaking multiple areas of support during the week as many leading stocks also came under pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
        <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.7% after surging more than 1% Sunday night. S&P 500 futures sank 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.%. Futures are active and volatile.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which dived last week on safe-haven flows, tumbled 21 basis points to 3.48%. But the 2-year Treasury yield plunged 50 basis points to 4.9%, as Fed rate hike odds fall.</p>
        <p>Markets are now pricing in just one quarter-point rate hike, with a solid chance that the Fed will pause on March 22. A few days ago, markets expected 50 basis points on March 22, with at least two more quarter-point hikes after that.</p>
        <p>Crude oil futures plunged 5%.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin rose sharply Sunday and largely held those gains Monday morning. The cryptocurrency tumbled last week on the Silvergate and SVB collapses.</p>
        <p>In other news, Pfizer (PFE) will buy Seagen (SGEN) for $229 a share, with an enterprise value of $43 billion, following weeks of talks. PFE stock fell modestly while SGEN stock leapt nearly 20%. Sanofi (SNY) will acquire Provention Bio (PRVB) for $2.9 billion, or $25 a share. SNY stock was little changed while PRVB stock more than tripled.</p>
        <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
        <p>The video embedded in this article discussed the market action in depth while also analyzing JPMorgan Chase, Palo Alto Networks and META stock.</p>
        <p><strong>FDIC, Regulators Protect SVB Financial Depositors</strong></p>
        <p>Shortly after Dow futures opened, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve issued a joint statement that SVB Financial's "[d]epositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13." They also announced that Signature Bank, which had a lot of crypto exposure, would be closed due to systemic risks. Signature Bank's depositors also will be protected.</p>
        <p>California regulators shut down SVB Financial and its Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary on Friday, the largest bank failure since Washington Mutual in the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
        <p>The FDIC held an auction over the weekend for Silicon Valley Bank, with final bids due Sunday afternoon, according to multiple reports. No winner has been announced.</p>
        <p>HSBC Holdings (HSBC) will buy SVB's U.K. arm for just over $1.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Fed is creating a new financial backstop for other banks. The facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks and other institutions. They'll have to pledge high-quality collateral such as Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Notably, that collateral will be valued at par, not mark to market. Banks have been sitting on unrealized debt losses as Fed rate hikes sent rates soaring over the past year. That was a big facto in SVB Financial's collapse.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of companies, including many venture capital and tech startups, have deposits or business ties to Silicon Valley Bank. There were reports that many will struggle to meet payroll without access to accounts soon.</p>
        <p>Notably, SVB and SBNY shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected.</p>
        <p>Stocks Near Buy Points</p>
        <p>Amid a weak, volatile, uncertain market, investors should not be making new position trades and instead be largely or entirely in cash. But keep an eye on stocks holding up near buy points. Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and United Airlines (UAL) are five stocks showing strength, near buy points. PANW stock has formed a handle on a long consolidation, while META stock has a new flat base. ULTA stock is finding support at key levels. Monolithic Power is working on a long cup-with-handle base while UAL stock has retreated from a buy zone.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has a new flat base as well. Tesla (TSLA) sold off hard this past week, but did find support at its 10-week line on Friday. TSLA stock is far from being actionable. Wolfe Research downgraded Tesla to peer perform on Monday, saying the SVB collapse adds to macro pressures.</p>
        <p>Insulet (PODD) will replace SIVB stock in the S&P 500 before Wednesday's open. PODD stock jumped Friday night.</p>
        <p>PANW stock is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist. MPWR stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders watchlist. Monolithic Power, United Airlines and ULTA stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
        <p><strong>Stock Market Weekly Action</strong></p>
        <p>The stock market started off higher but quickly reversed lower for major losses on Fed rate hike fears and later the SVB Financial and Silvergate shutdowns.</p>
        <p>Twice on Friday, stocks bounced as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed confidence in a "resilient" banking system. But the positive momentum quickly faded.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4.4% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index sold off 4.55%. The Nasdaq composite skidded 4.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dived 8%.</p>
        <p>Apple stock fell just 1.7% for the week to 148.50, holding above its 200-day line. But that's after reversing from Monday's intraday high of 156.30, nearly hitting AAPL's 157.48 buy point.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield plunged 29 basis points to 3.69% this past week, after hitting a 2023 high of 4.09% on March 2. The 2-year yield tumbled 27 basis points to 4.59%, including 31 basis points on Friday and 48 points on Thursday-Friday.</p>
        <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell 3.8% to $76.68 a barrel this past week, but did rise on Friday.</p>
        <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
        <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) plunged just over 6% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) slumped 3.4%.  The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gave up 5.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 3%, with MPWR stock an SMH holding.</p>
        <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) dived 10.9% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 11.4%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. TSLA fell 12.3% for the week, amid fresh price cuts and safety probes. But shares edged up on Friday.</p>
        <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) sold off 11.1% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 7.1%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 4.8, with UAL stock a key component. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 4.85%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gave up 5.3%.  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) slumped 3.85% to the lowest point since October.</p>
        <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dived 8.5%, with JPMorgan and SCHW stock big holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) plummeted 15.7%, its worst weekly loss since the Covid crash in March 2020. SIVB stock and Western Alliance are notable components.</p>
        <p><strong>Market Analysis</strong></p>
        <p>The stock market suffered damaging losses this past week, with the major indexes selling off hard and breaking through multiple support levels. The indexes tried to bounce back from early losses Friday, briefly turning positive, before tumbling to fresh lows.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 tumbled through their 21-day lines early in the week and finished decisively below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 finished Friday below the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones is at its worst levels since early November.</p>
        <p>Fed chief Jerome Powell's signal that he favors "faster" rate hikes hit the market on Tuesday-Wednesday. But SVB Financial and crypto bank Silvergate Capital rocked banks late in the week.</p>
        <p>A Friday morning rebound attempt fizzled as the FDIC announced SVB Financial's failure.</p>
        <p>If bank contagion fears grow, that would be grim for Wall Street and the economy. However, if SVB Financial's woes are seen as isolated and broader banking fears quickly fade, that could restore overall market confidence. But that would also likely send Treasury yields and the dollar rebounding higher, with Fed rate hike odds also increasing.</p>
        <p>The odds of a half-point Fed rate hike surged from 30% on Monday to over 80% following Fed chief Powell's testimony, then fell back below 40% on Friday. The odds fell further over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Leading stocks also sold off hard last week. A number of names held up for much of the week, but most of those were struggling by Friday's close.</p>
        <p>Up until Thursday, Friday's jobs report and the upcoming March 14 CPI inflation report seemed like major events. And they are still important. A relatively tame CPI inflation rate could give Fed chief Powell and his colleagues the excuse they need to raise rates by only a quarter-point.</p>
        <p>But in the very near term, Wall Street will likely take its cue from the banking sector. So pay attention to banks, from the biggest recent losers such as First Republic to broad ETFs and relative stalwarts such as JPM stock.</p>
        <p>JPMorgan was the S&P 500's second-best stock on Friday, even as SBNY stock, First Republic and Schwab were the worst performers. That's a sign that investors see JPMorgan as relatively safe. But if JPM stock breaks this past week's lows, that would be concerning.</p>
        <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
        <p>The stock market is selling off hard amid bad news and even-greater uncertainty.</p>
        <p>This is not a healthy environment. Investors should be largely or entirely on the sidelines, waiting to see how this shakes out. If conditions clear up in a few days or weeks, new buying opportunities will arise.</p>
        <p>Build your watchlists with a focus on the stocks showing strong relative strength. If they're near potential buy points like META stock, Monolithic Power or Palo Alto, great. But that's not the priority right now.</p>

      content: <div className="blog-content">
        <p>A 33% plunge in the previously high-flying Nasdaq Composite is the perfect time for growth investors to pounce on some amazing deals.</p>
        <p>While I hate being the bearer of bad news, stock market corrections are a perfectly normal part of the investing cycle. Since the beginning of 1950, the benchmark S&P 500 has undergone 39 separate double-digit percentage corrections, according to data from sell-side consultancy firm Yardeni Research. In other words, the drubbing Wall Street took in 2022 is par for the course when investing for the long run.</p>
        <p>When the major indexes crossed the finish line last year, it was the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) that was hit hardest. The Nasdaq, which led the broader market to new highs in 2021, shed 33% of its value in 2022 and continues to stew in a bear market.</p>
        <p>But there's a silver lining in this bad news. Though we'll never be able to forecast exactly when a bear market will occur or how steep the decline will be, we do know that every previous bear market in the major U.S. stock indexes (including the Nasdaq) was eventually whisked away by a bull market. It effectively means that every bear market is the ideal time to put your money to work.</p>
        <p>It's an especially lucrative time to go shopping for growth stocks. What follows are five stunning growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
        <p><strong>Nio</strong></p>
        <p>The first phenomenal growth stock just begging to be bought during the bear market decline is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO). Although supply chain issues continue to weigh on Nio's production expansion efforts, a number of headwinds have been safely put in the back seat.</p>
        <p>For the past couple of years, China stocks carried extra investment risk due to the country's zero-COVID strategy, as well as the possible delisting of China stocks by U.S. regulators. However, China has abandoned its zero-COVID strategy and reopened its economy. What's more, regulators gained hold of three years' worth of financial audits for Chinese firms, which removes the fear of delisting. In short, Nio is considerably de-risked from where things stood four months ago.</p>
        <p>But what's really been impressive about this company is its various forms of innovation. Nio has been introducing at least one new EV each year and has seen sales of its ET7 and ET5 sedans take off since hitting showrooms last year. With the exception of January, when production was constrained by factory closures as a result of the Chinese New Year, Nio has delivered in excess of 10,000 EVs every month since June 2022, with its sedans regularly accounting for more than half of those deliveries.</p>
        <p>Nio's out-of-the-box innovation is on display as well. In August 2020, the company announced the rollout of its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription. BaaS allows its EV buyers to charge, swap, and upgrade batteries at more than 1,300 power swap stations and more than 1,200 power charger stations. In exchange for a reduced EV purchase price, Nio nets high-margin, recurring subscription revenue from buyers via BaaS and keeps buyers loyal to the brand.</p>
        <p><strong>Exelixis</strong></p>
        <p>The second amazing growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is biotech stock Exelixis (EXEL). Despite occasional clinical trial failures, cancer-drug developer Exelixis is well positioned to grow by double digits.</p>
        <p>A little over a week ago, Exelixis announced that a late-stage study involving its blockbuster drug Cabometyx in combination with Roche's Tecentriq failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in a trial for patients with previously treated advanced kidney cancer.  But failures happen. It's part of being a drug developer.</p>
        <p>What's far more important is that Exelixis has around six dozen clinical trials ongoing involving Cabometyx as a monotherapy or combination treatment for a variety of cancer types. It only takes a handful of success stories to significantly expand Cabometyx's sales and pricing power. We've already witnessed one of these studies finding the mark, which led to Exelixis and Bristol Myers Squibb gaining first-line approval for their combination treatment for renal cell carcinoma.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Exelixis has the cash to fund ongoing internal development, collaborations, and possibly even acquisitions. The company closed out 2022 with approximately $1.31 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and had another $756.7 million in long-term investments. </p>
        <p><strong>Walt Disney</strong></p>
        <p>A third stunning growth stock you'll regret not adding during the Nasdaq bear market drop is the popular "House of Mouse," Walt Disney (DIS). Though Walt Disney is a mature business, it's expected to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate for the next half-decade. That absolutely makes it a growth stock.</p>
        <p>The biggest competitive edge that Disney offers is that its business can't be duplicated. While there are other theme parks consumers can visit and other movies on the big screen, Disney's characters and stories, along with the emotion, engagement, and imagination they evoke in consumers, can't be duplicated by any other company.</p>
        <p>As I've previously suggested, the value of this irreplaceability can be seen in Walt Disney's pricing power. Since Disneyland opened its doors in Southern California in 1955, admission prices have risen by 10,300%. By comparison, the U.S. inflation rate has jumped a little over 1,000% over the same time span.  Disney has also been able to raise prices on its ad-free streaming service, Disney+, while losing only a small fraction of its subscribers. </p>
        <p>The next step in Walt Disney's evolution is turning its money-losing streaming segment into a profit machine. Newly reappointed CEO Bob Iger increased monthly subscription prices and is targeting profitability for this segment toward the end of fiscal 2024. Once streaming becomes cash-flow positive, I'd be surprised to see Disney stock anywhere near $100 per share.</p>
        <p><strong>Innovative Industrial Properties</strong></p>
        <p>The fourth magnificent growth stock that you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq's bear market swoon is marijuana-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). In spite of rent-collection speed bumps in recent months, IIP, as Innovative Industrial Properties is known, can show patient investors the green.</p>
        <p>The prevailing concern with IIP is that its on-time rental collection rate has dropped from 100% to 92% as of the end of February 2023. But it's important to understand that all REITs eventually deal with delinquencies. It's how companies handle their delinquencies that matters. IIP's fourth-quarter report and year-to-date update shows it's working through these delinquencies and should be able to sustain these revenue streams or outright sell these properties for cash.</p>
        <p>Another key point with Innovative Industrial Properties is that 100% of its properties are triple-net leased (also known as "NNN leased"). NNN-leased properties require the tenant to cover all expenses, including utilities, maintenance, and even property tax and insurance. While NNN leases reduce the rental income IIP can expect to receive, it also removes any chance of surprise expenses or inflation hurting the company.</p>
        <p>Lastly, Innovative Industrial Properties might be one of the few pot stocks benefiting from weed remaining illegal at the federal level. Since most cannabis companies have limited access to basic financial services, IIP has been able to work out sale-leaseback agreements that benefit both parties. Cultivators and processors get cash they sorely need from IIP, and IIP lands long-term tenants through this program.</p>
        <p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>
        <p>A fifth stunning growth stock that you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, autonomous vehicle company Waymo, and streaming platform YouTube.</p>
        <p>At the moment, advertising weakness is Alphabet's biggest headwind. When the probability of a recession materializing rises, advertisers pull back on their spending. But this is also a two-sided coin. Even though recessions are inevitable, they're typically short-lived. Buying ad-driven stocks during these short swoons often allows investors to take advantage of long-winded economic expansions.</p>
        <p>Alphabet's competitive advantage isn't going away anytime soon, either. Since December 2018, data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for roughly 91% to 93% of global internet search share. Having a 90-percentage-point lead over its next-closest competitor allows Google to command significant pricing power for ad placement.</p>
        <p>Alphabet's ancillary operating segments provide plenty of promise, too. YouTube is the second most visited social platform in the world, with Shorts getting more than 50 billion daily views. Meanwhile, Google Cloud has worked its way up to a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure-service spending. </p>
        <p>Based on both forward-year earnings and future cash flow, Alphabet is cheaper now than at any point since it became a publicly traded company.</p>

        <p>MasterCard (MA) closed at $361.50 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.67% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 12.91%.</p>
        <p>Coming into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 5.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 5.68%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.54%.</p>
        <p>Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.70, down 2.17% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.61 billion, up 8.58% from the year-ago period.</p>
        <p>MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.13 per share and revenue of $25.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.9% and +12.55%, respectively.</p>
        <p>It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.</p>
        <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
        <p>The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% higher. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
        <p>Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MasterCard has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.32 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.8, which means MasterCard is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, MA's PEG ratio is currently 1.68. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Financial Transaction Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.18 based on yesterday's closing prices.</p>
        <p>The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, putting it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.</p>
        <p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>
        <p>You can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- US stocks ended the week on a high note, driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates beyond peak levels already priced in.</p>
        <p>A rally in the S&P 500 Friday helped snap a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 scored its best day since early February. Sentiment remained upbeat despite a report showing resilience in the service sector, as some investors wagered the impact of the Fed’s hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers showed costs rising at a slower pace, which was cheered by traders.</p>
        <p>Bond yields rose for the week though Treasuries rallied on Friday, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.96%. A benchmark of the dollar had its worst week since mid-January, ending four consecutive weeks of gains.</p>
        <p>All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls report next week for clues on whether the economy can handle more rate hikes. Data this week showed continued labor-market resilience in the US, supporting the case for the Fed to stick to its tightening policy, a theme that had pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.</p>
        <p>But investors were heartened after Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that the central bank could possibly pause its rate hikes sometime this summer. Traders interpreted his comments as dovish, even though Bostic and his colleagues said decisions would continue to be data dependent and a Fed report on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are in store.</p>

        <p>Traders are still optimistic because even the most hawkish Fed officials haven’t suggested that rates could need to go beyond levels already baked in, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. Swap markets have been pricing a peak Fed policy rate of 5.5% in September.</p>
        <p>“I think they stay at 5.5% and we have to see how data evolves in the second quarter,” she said on Bloomberg Television.</p>
        <p>Misra also added that robust data doesn’t mean the Fed’s persistent tightening isn’t working.</p>
        <p>“It takes a long time,” she said. “Policy only turned restrictive last year.”</p>

        <p>Risk sentiment also received a boost on Friday from forecast-beating factory data from China. Oil gained for the fourth day, with confidence in China’s robust rebound supporting prices.</p>

        <p><strong>Stock Traders Are Ignoring Blaring Bond Alarms</strong></p>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- The fixed-income market’s unblemished record of striking fear into the hearts of equity traders is in danger.</p>
        <p>With rates on two- and 10-year Treasuries up a sixth straight week, and payouts on cash at or above the earnings yield of the S&P 500, stock investors are barely registering a shrug. Benchmark US share indexes just posted their biggest runup in a month, climaxing Friday with a jump in the Nasdaq 100 that topped any since early February.</p>
        <p>Why peace is breaking out in risky assets during a week that at one point saw yields in the entire Treasury market rise above 4% is a mystery Wall Street has no easy answer for. Charts may be one reason: the S&P 500 bounced sharply after falling below its 200-day average on Wednesday. Another may be that investors are interpreting elevated rates as a sign strong economic data is likely to persist, says Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance LLC.</p>
        <p>“It’s interesting to see stocks whistling past the graveyard,” Zaccarelli said. “Stock investors may be looking for yields to drop as a sign we are going to have a recession and are seeing an all-clear in the sense that rates are higher.”</p>
        <p>The indifference to calamity on display in stocks was particularly vivid as the week ended. Friday’s 1.6% gain in the S&P 500 pushed the Cboe Volatility Index below 19, testing lows hit when equities surged at the start of the year. A basket of most-shorted stocks rose 3.2% — it’s fifth straight advance — while a gauge of unprofitable technology companies vaulted almost 6%.</p>
        <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-84-1.webp" alt="ncx-blogs" />
        <p>It’s happening even as money cascades out of stock-focused ETFs and into fixed-income funds, as risk-free yields reach multi-year highs. Short-dated Treasury bills are enticing investors as yields push above 5%, eclipsing the payout on everything from profits generated by S&P 500 companies to those offered by the traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>But while the trade is touted as risk free, it comes with opportunity costs. Grasping for a 5% yield right in an S&P 500 bear market strikes certain money managers as an iffy proposition.</p>
        <p>“That short rate isn’t going to be at those levels forever — it’s probably going to end up lower,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. “What we’ve seen over long periods of time is that the long-term assets outperform cash. And we have every reason to believe that’s going to be the case.”</p>
        <p>Over the past year, the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill exchange-traded fund (ticker BIL) has returned about 2%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 6.3% on a total return basis. However, over the past decade BIL is flat, while SPY soared 165% during an epic bull run.</p>
        <p>“There’s much less ‘opportunity cost’ than what we’re used to because it’s a place where you can get paid while you wait, but there’s not long-term price potential like in equities,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “So for people with more than a five-year time horizon, you still need equities in the portfolio to set you up for compounding returns.”</p>
        <p>The notion that yields may be peaking also has investors preaching caution when it comes to bonds. While bets have been building in recent weeks that the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates past 5% to stamp out inflation — boosting yields across the Treasury curve — traders are pricing in an end to increases by September.</p>
        <p>Tipp hearkened back to the 1970s, when inflation was a threat to both stocks and bonds. As growth moderated and rates leveled off and then came down, equities rose — even though the economy remained weak.</p>
        <p>“There’s a good chance that that kind of cyclicality is going to make its way through the markets, and people that lock in at the short term, exit the long-term markets and go into short term are going to suffer,” he said. “Their long-term returns are not going to be as high because the cash rates will probably move lower.”</p>
        <p>Analysts say that the haven appeal of cash-like positions combined with reliable returns means investors have an attractive place to wait out any turbulence induced by the Fed’s path.</p>
        <p>“I do think that we need to take advantage of the higher yields on the short-end of the yield curve, wait out this continued volatility,” David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview. “And then at some point we’ll hit a bottom, and that will be a great time to re-risk, take that money out of cash, put it back in equities and you’ll benefit from that.”</p>
        <p>Six-month Treasury bills currently yield about 5.1%, the highest since 2007, compared to the S&P 500’s earnings yield of roughly 5.3%. That’s the slimmest advantage for stocks since 2001.</p>
        <p>Though bonds look attractive at current yields relative to equities, the risk investors are taking in allocating to cash is the uncertainty of that yield going forward, said Josh Emanuel, chief investment officer at Wilshire, which oversees roughly $90 billion.</p>
        <p>“So, cash may pay you 4.5-5% today, but in one year that may not be the case, in two years that may not be the case,” he said in an interview. “The challenge in allocating to cash is that while you’re not taking any duration risk and you’re not taking any credit risk, the risk that you’re taking is the opportunity cost or the uncertainty risk associated with what that cash will pay you in the future relative to the yield you can lock in over the longer-term by moving out further on the yield curve.”</p>

        <h3>S&P 500 Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
        <p>The S&P 500 initially dipped during the trading week to show signs of weakness, only to turn around and show signs of life again. We are back above the 4000 level, so that of course is a good sign, but at the end of the day, this is a market that looks as if it is trying to roll over. Keep in mind that we have just gone through a significant portion of earnings, and it’s been a mixed bag to say the least.</p>
        <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the week, then it is likely that we could go down to the 3800 level, an area that previously had been rather supportive. By bouncing from there, it puts an imprint of support in that region that I think a lot of people will be paying attention to. On the upside, we have the 4100 level, which was previous support, but even more importantly we have the 4200 level above that has caused quite a bit of selling pressure, almost like a brick wall. That’s an area where we continue to see a lot of noise, so it does make a target that a lot of people may look for, but breaking above there might be a completely different question.</p>
        <p>You can see that I had a channel drawn previously, and we did break out of it only to turn around and retest that area for potential support. Either way, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility, so longer term traders may struggle.</p>

        <p>By Mehnaz Yasmin</p>
        <p>(Reuters) - The reward for holding U.S. stocks over Treasury bonds has not been this unattractive since 2004, possibly setting the stage for the sought-after 60/40 portfolio diversification to make a comeback after one of its worst years on record.</p>
        <p>A 60/40 portfolio, which typically has 60% of its holdings in stocks and the remaining 40% in fixed income, counts on moves in the two asset classes to offset one another, with stocks strengthening amid economic optimism and bonds rising during turbulent times.</p>
        <p>The strategy took a backseat in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to rein in inflation. However, signals from the stock and bond markets this year are pointing to a return of the popular asset allocation strategy.</p>
        <p>At the end of February, the S&P 500 returned 5.41% in earnings yield, the reciprocal of price-to-earnings ratio, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond surged to 3.94%, according to data from Refinitiv. The 1.47 percentage-point difference is the lowest upside stocks have held over bonds in nearly two decades.</p>
        <p>Earnings yield here refers to the S&P 500 earnings per share estimate for the next 12 moths divided by the index price.</p>
        <p>Graphic:https://www.reuters.com/graphics/STOCK-SPREADS/CHART/byprlqxyepe/chart.png</p>
        <p>"The relative shine of equities is definitely dulled by rising yields across the Treasury curve," said Eric Leve, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management firm Bailard.</p>
        <p>With estimates for earnings in 2023 implying essentially no growth over 2022, rates above 5% on short-term bonds and 10-year yields on the verge of 4% represent credible alternatives to stocks, according to Leve.</p>
        <p>The thinning spread between returns from stocks and bonds is set to bring the 60/40 portfolio strategy back in favor.</p>
        <p>"This strategy does provide excellent hedging in current environment," said Glenn Yin, Head of Research and Analysis at AETOS Capital Group.</p>
        <p>The 60/40 portfolio has already had the best start to the year since 1991, according to Bank of America.</p>
        <p>The Fed's move to tighten monetary policy at the fastest pace in decades pumped up bond yields after nearly two years of near-zero interest rates.</p>
        <p>But a rise in yields poses headwinds for equities, especially growth stocks, and by extension, a large index like the S&P 500. Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among the tech heavyweights that make up nearly a fifth of the index and bore the brunt of a sell-off last year.</p>
        <p>"Equity yields will continue to struggle this year as both prices and earnings decline" amid an economic slowdown, said Lance Roberts, Chief Investment Strategist at RIA Advisors.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, "during a recession, yields will fall and Treasury bond prices will rise," said Roberts. He prefers bonds over stocks today, he added.</p>
        <p>Recent results and guidance from companies have bolstered the case for investors who believe the stock market's early-year rally is unlikely to last.</p>
        <p>As of Feb. 24, results from 465 of the S&P 500 companies showed fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have fallen 3.2% from the year-ago quarter while Wall Street's expectation for S&P earnings growth for 2023 fell to 1.7% from an expected 4.4% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>Expectations for U.S. earnings to decline in the first two quarters if the year come amid weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results for 2022, which Credit Suisse estimates will be the worst earnings season outside of a recession in 24 years.</p>
        <p>Investors are hoping that in case of a severe recession, the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates. While the economic downturn would hit stock returns, drop in bond yields should provide some relief in such a scenario, according to analysts.</p>
        <p>"For me, the best risk-reward portfolio in this environment for now is long duration Treasury bonds, and deep value, dividend equities," Roberts said. Deep value refers to stocks that are trading at a huge discount to their intrinsic values.</p>
        <p>"When the recession arrives, and the Fed cuts rates to zero, I will sell my bond portfolio to lock in the capital appreciation, and buy distressed equities with high yields and companies with strong balance sheets and earnings growth," he added.</p>

        <p>Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are moving in Friday's intraday trading.</p>
        <p><strong>Video Transcript</strong></p>
        <p>[AUDIO LOGO]</p>
        <p>- Yeah. And taking a look at the market reaction here this morning too. You do see a little bit of just before the start of that 10:00 AM hour, it's moved lower off of, though, some of the intraday highs that we had seen early in today's trading activity on the Dow Jones Industrial average. Still holding onto gains of about a quarter of a percent in the green.</p>
        <p>The NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that also in positive territory. Up triple digits on a point basis. Percentage basis, it's up by about 1%. We'll round that off too. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 7/10 of a percent right now. Still holding on to those gains.</p>
        <p>And additionally, checking in on the major sectors here. The S&P 500 11. Taking a look at those sectors, and XLB is leading the pack, at least on that previous time scale that was loaded up on the screen. XLRE here on the day, on this Fri-yay, it's higher by about 1.25%. But you've got XLP. Yeah, indeed. Consumer staples not looking so hot, hot, hot. Down by about 7/10 of a percent here this morning, and we'll continue to watch that as we move on throughout the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>Overall though, you've got more gainers than laggards here, and we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. Taking a look at some of the Dow components as well. Apple is really leading the charge today. You're seeing that higher by about 2.5%. We've got much more on that this hour as well. And taking a look at the NASDAQ, you've also got a pretty mixed picture here. We'll kind of put this on a broader heat map view. It looks like more gainers than laggards. Just a rough look at things here on the day.</p>
