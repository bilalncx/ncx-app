    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Dow Jones futures tilted higher Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet today for face-to-face debt-ceiling talks. China sanctions vs. Micron Technology (MU) weighed on chip stocks.</p>
    	<p>Nvidia earnings loom large this week.</p>	
    	<p>The stock market rally strengthened last week on debt-ceiling deal optimism and easing bank fears, with gains led by AI-infused tech leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), ServiceNow (NOW), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Snowflake (SNOW) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR).</p>	
    	<p>The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 hit 2023 highs, with the Nasdaq 100 setting its best levels in more than a year. For much of the week, the White House and congressional leaders appeared to be moving toward a debt-ceiling deal while concerns about regional banks waned.</p>
      <p>On Friday, GOP negotiators suspended debt-ceiling talks, saying President Biden's White House was being unreasonable. At around the same time, a report came out stating that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told bank execs that more bank mergers may be needed. That hit regional bank stocks Friday, though they rose strongly for the week.</p>
      <p>The major indexes took the debt-ceiling setback and Yellen's comments in stride Friday. That's in part because around the same time Fed chief Jerome Powell signaled he favors a rate pause next month.</p>
      <p>The stock market rally remains somewhat split, with narrow leadership. Still, investors can be adding exposure carefully, though not a lot of stocks are offering buying opportunities at the moment.</p>
      <p>Tesla (TSLA) made a bullish move this past week amid its shareholder event, clearing some key levels. But TSLA stock faces further resistance.</p>
      <h3>Debt Ceiling Talks</h3>
      <p>Investors have remained confident in a debt-limit deal, but doubts may be growing.</p>
      <p>President Biden had a phone call with Speaker McCarthy Sunday morning as he flew back from the Group of Seven meeting in Japan. McCarthy said it was a "productive" call, but "there's no agreement. We're still apart."</p>
      <p>White House and House GOP negotiators met Sunday. Biden and McCarthy will meet Monday.</p>
      <p>Earlier Sunday, President Biden said that he's "looking at the 14th Amendment" to declare debt limits invalid, saying "I think we have the authority." That's much further than the president has gone before. But he worries that the U.S. could default amid court challenges to that untested legal option. "The question is could it be done and invoked in time."</p>
      <p>The U.S. is likely to hit the debt ceiling in early June.</p>
      <h3>Micron, Meta Face Overseas Sanction</h3>
      <p>China warned key Chinese information infrastructure operators against buying Micron Technology (MU) chips, saying it found "relatively serious" cybersecurity risks. Beijing is targeting the U.S. memory-chip maker as it begins to retaliate vs. U.S. chip export bans to China.</p>
      <p>MU stock fell modestly, off initial premarket lowers. A number of other chip stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, edged lower.</p>
      <p>The European Union on Monday fined Meta Platforms (META) a record $1.3 billion for sending user information to the U.S.. META stock fell slightly.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures edged higher.</p>
      <p>PacWest Bancorp (PACW) will sell 74 real estate loans to Kennedy-Wilson (KW) worth $2.6 billion for $2.4 billion. PACW stock rose solidly while KW advanced slightly.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Nvidia Earnings</h3>
      <p>Nvidia earnings Wednesday night will be a big deal. NVDA stock is everything that's going right with the market rally. It's the leading megacap and AI stock in a market rally dominated by megacaps and AI plays. Nvidia shares leapt 10% last week and it's significantly extended.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock pausing or pulling back modestly over several weeks would be healthy. But if Nvidia earnings or guidance disappoint, NVDA could be punished severely. That also could have repercussions for rival AMD as well as Google and a slew of "AI" plays that have been driving the market higher.</p>
      <p>ServiceNow stock took off last week amid AI-related alliances with Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT). SNOW stock gained on a report that it could buy an AI search firm. PLTR stock, long an AI play, vaulted 23% for the week after the prior week's 28% spike on earnings. Google stock has leapt 14% so far in May.</p>
      <h3>Other Key Earnings</h3>
      <p>Snowflake, Elf Beauty (ELF), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) also have earnings this week.</p>
      <p>SNOW stock is in a 10-month consolidation. ELF stock is consolidating at its 21-day line after a huge run. PANW stock is trying to hold its 50-day line within a new, volatile flat base. DECK stock had been a big winner but tumbled this past week below its 50-day line as On Holding (ONON) and Foot Locker (FL) dived on their results.</p>
      <p>Nvidia stock is on IBD Leaderboard, with ELF stock on the Leaderboard watchlist. SNOW stock is on the IBD 50. NOW stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in the article discussed the weekly market action and reviewed three non-AI plays setting up: Life Time Group (LTH), Meritage Homes (MTH) and MercadoLibre (MELI).</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally advanced last week, with a big gap between leaders and laggards.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index advanced 1.65%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 bounced 1.9%.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield leapt 23 basis points to 3.69%, hitting a two-month high.</p>
      <p>The odds of a Fed rate hike next month briefly topped 40% during the week amid strong economic data and some hawkish comments from Fed officials. But with Powell saying "we can afford to look at the data," the chance slipped back to about 20% on Friday.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures climbed 2.2% to $71.55 a barrel for the week.</p>
      <h3>ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) surged 5.25% last week. NOW stock is a big IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) soared 8.5%. Nvidia stock is a major SMH holding, along with AMD stock. Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) rose 2.7% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) gained 3%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest ETFs. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns some PLTR stock.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) slipped 0.5%, its fifth straight weekly loss. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 4.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 1.2%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gained 1.4%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) slipped 0.7%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) rose 2.2% The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rebounded 7.8%, even with Friday's 1.8% retreat.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock A Buy?</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock rallied 7.2% last week to 180.14, rebounding from near the 21-day line and retaking the 50-day line for the first time since early April.</p>
      <p>Investors responded well to Tuesday's Tesla shareholder day. CEO Elon Musk reiterated that the Cybertruck will begin deliveries this year, while again hinting at a next-generation vehicle. Musk also said Tesla will "try" some advertising. Like any savvy CEO in 2023, he made sure to mention "AI" several times.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tesla quietly offered some new inventory discounts on U.S. Model 3 vehicles, following recent discounts on Model 3 and Y vehicles in Europe. Inventory discounts don't get the headlines that official price cuts do, but they hit profit margins all the same. The balance between production, deliveries and prices is the key Tesla story in 2023.</p>
      <p>Investors could view Friday's move above the 50-day moving average as an early entry for Tesla stock. But it would be extremely aggressive. Tesla still faces the 200-day line, which is coming down toward 200. Just above that is a 207.89 buy point, just above the March 31 high. That's either from a seven-week consolidation or a three-month double-bottom buy point.</p>
      <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally showed strength last week, but the advance remains narrow. The Nasdaq boomed, hitting a 2023 high, with the S&P 500 also doing so late in the week.</p>
      <p>The Russell 2000, buoyed by bank stocks, also had a solid week, but is well off 2023 highs. The Dow Jones eked out a small weekly gain after undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The tech rally has expanded from megacap stocks such as Google and Nvidia to big-cap chip and software names such as AMD, ServiceNow and AI plays such as Palantir. But most are extended now.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq 100 hit a 52-week high, up 3.5% for the week. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which had been struggling, popped 2.45%. It's close to 2023 highs.</p>
      <p>But overall breadth remains lackluster. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) climbed nearly 1%, but slipped back below its 200-day line on Friday. RSP isn't much closer to its 2023 highs than its October bear market lows.</p>
      <p>Losers led advancers on Friday after modestly positive breadth on Thursday. But new highs outpaced losers for a second straight session.</p>
      <p>Beyond chips, software and megacap stocks, homebuilders, building materials, medical products and biopharma names are acting well. So are travel plays and some payment stocks.</p>
      <p>Shoe-related stocks were heels this past week due to ONON and Foot Locker. Deckers Outdoor, as well as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), will try to put their best foot forward.</p>
      <p>Debt-ceiling talks, banking concerns and recession risks remain big issues for the market rally. While Wall Street and political analysts still see a debt-limit deal as highly likely, various headlines could swing markets up and down over the next several days.</p>
      <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally is trending higher, but leadership is narrow and market breadth suspect. Many of the leading stocks are extended.</p>
      <p>Investors who took advantage of techs clearing buy signals in the past week or so generally have been rewarded, some hugely. But overall exposure should remain modest. Consider taking partial profits on big winners. Definitely have a game plan in place.</p>
      <p>A healthy number of stocks are setting up from a variety of sectors, and could get going if the market rally broadens out. So you'll want to be ready.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Wall Street, European stocks and the FTSE 100 were mixed on Monday as investors continue to worry about the US defaulting on its debt amid ongoing talks.</p>
    	<p>President Joe Biden and House Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to hold further talks on Monday.</p>	
    	<p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 0.15% to open at 7,768.32 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris lost 0.16% to 7,479.70 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 0.15% to 16,252.26 points.</p>	
    	<h3>FTSE</h3>
      <p>“China-linked stocks like Burberry (BRBY.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) are at the top of the large-cap index following positive price action overnight from the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.</p>
      <p>JD Sports Fashion (JD.L) also moved up the FTSE 100 basket after the retailer said it was on course to make £1bn in annual profit. Halma and ConvaTec were at the bottom of the index in afternoon London trade.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, traders were also watching NatWest (NWG.L) stock as the bank agreed to buy £1.3bn ($1.6bn) of its shares back from the government, which reduces the government's stake to 38.69%.</p>
      <p>“The Treasury is aiming to return NatWest to private ownership by 2025-2026 while attempting to ‘achieve the best value for the taxpayer’. In April, the government’s shareholding stood at 42%, down from a peak of 84%, falling further again this week,” Scholar added.</p>
      <p>Shares in NatWest have struggled this year, caught up in the banking sector turmoil with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the rescue deal for Credit Suisse (CS).</p>
      <p>However, with shares up almost 15% year-on-year to Friday’s close, the government decided it was a good moment to sell some shares, Scholar noted.</p> 
      <p>Meanwhile, Ireland’s low budget airline Ryanair (RYA.IR) has reported a full-year profit of €1.43bn, closing in on its 2018 record of €1.45bn.</p>
      <p>It said it flew 168.6 million passengers, up 74% to an all-time high, breaking its pre-pandemic record of 149 million. The group said it is aiming to get to 225 million passengers by 2026 and also highlighted it wants to be debt free in the next three to four years.</p>
      <p>The airline said it is also expecting a strong summer for bookings but thinks winter could be more challenging with consumer spending under strain.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia markets</h3>
      <p>In the US, two of the three major indices opened in the green as traders waited for a deal to be struck to avert a debt default ahead of the 1 June deadline. President Joe Biden and House Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy are expected to hold further talks later following a phone call on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) fell 0.02% to 33,421.12 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.03% to 4,193.22 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) also rose slightly, by 0.06% to 12,664.90.</p>
      <p>Meta (META) was among the biggest gainers, up nearly 3%, despite reports of a £1bn fine from EU data regulators, while shares in US chip giant Micron (MU) were down nearly 4% on the NASDAQ.</p>
      <p>“US-Sino trade tensions are escalating after Beijing banned Micron Technologies from selling semiconductors to key industries in China, a move strongly opposed by Washington,” Scholar said.</p>
      <p>In Asia, markets rose. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) went up 0.90% to 31,086.82 points, lifting stocks to the highest level since the 1990s, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.54% to 19,750.18. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was also in the green, up 0.36% to 3,294.92 points.</p>
      <p>The People’s Bank of China kept its loan prime rate unchanged for a ninth consecutive month in May.</p>
      <p>“Central bank policymakers clearly judged that loosening monetary policy would exacerbate the yuan’s weakness and interest rate differentials, despite China’s shaky path to recovery out of the pandemic,” Scholar added.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) declined against the US dollar by 0.09% to 1.24.</p>
      <p>Against the euro, sterling (GBPEUR=X) was also down, by 0.09% to 1.15.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>In commodities, US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), fell 1.22% to $70.68 per barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) dropped 0.78% to $74.99 per barrel.</p>
      <h3>Economic data</h3>
      <p>Investors will also be looking for some clarity on the future outlook of US interest rate policy when the latest US Federal Minutes from the May meeting are released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Any comments indicating that the Fed is either concerned about the aggressive pace of US interest rate increases impacting the United States economy over the longer-term or confirmation that no more US interest rate hikes are likely can lead to a pause in the recent USD revival,” Jameel Ahmad, chief analyst at CompareBroker.io, said.</p>
      <p>The latest US consumer spending data, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is also set to be released this week — another gauge for inflation pressures.</p>

    	<p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks opened higher, extending rallies on Wall Street fuelled by optimism over talks to avert a catastrophic US debt default.</p>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 0.39% to 7,883 points at the open, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.22% to 7,560 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 0.10% to 15,866.</p>	
    	<p>The FTSE 100 rose as data showed British consumer confidence hit a 15-month high, adding to the optimism that a deal over the US debt ceiling was imminent.</p>	
    	<p>Traders will be keeping an eye on the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, which starts on Friday, where world leaders are expected to discuss international trade and security. China and Russia relations and sanctions are on the agenda for discussions between Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States.</p>
      <h3>FTSE</h3>
      <p>London stocks edged higher in early trade on Friday following a positive close on Wall Street, amid hopes a deal will be reached to avert a US debt default and improved consumer confidence.</p>
      <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: "Growing optimism for a resolution to the debt ceiling negotiations lifted sentiment, although the mood was slightly tempered by question marks over the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.</p>
      <p>"The mood music from the politicians involved in brokering a deal to raise the debt ceiling and avoid an unthinkable US default was more positive, with investors reacting with cautious optimism until such time as a deal is finalised."</p>
      <p>Miners led the gains across the UK's blue chip index, with Anglo American (AAL.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Glencore (GLEN.L) and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) all up.</p>
      <p>Smiths Group (SMIN.L) rallied as it lifted revenue guidance after a strong third quarter, driven by volume and price growth. Organic revenue was up 13.4% for the nine months to 30 April, leading Smiths to increase 2023 guidance to around 10% organic revenue growth with "moderate" margin improvement.</p>
      <p>BT Group (BT-A.L) steadied at 140p after Thursday’s results-day hammering, while Burberry (BRBY.L) slipped 2.51%.</p>
      <p>Also driving sentiments across the markets was data suggesting that consumer confidence in the year ahead is continuing to recover despite persistent cost of living pressures.</p>
      <p>GfK’s Consumer Confidence Index rose by three points in May to minus 27, the fourth monthly increase in a row from January’s minus 45.</p>
      <p>Confidence in personal finances over the coming 12 months saw a “robust” five-point jump to minus 8 — 17 points higher than this time last year.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were mixed as trading began in Europe.</p>
      <p>Wall Street closed higher on Thursday as investors await updates to the ongoing debt ceiling debate and quarterly results from Walmart (WMT) flashed resilience from the American consumer.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.34% to close at 33,535 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.94% to 4,198 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) jumped 1.51% to 12,688.</p>
      <p>“We are starting to see enough common themes in their views to feel confident that a deal is going to be announced in relatively short order,” Jefferies US economist Thomas Simmons wrote in a note.</p>
      <p>“Given the 1 June X-date warnings from Treasury and the time it takes for the legislative process to play out, we could see an announcement of a framework as soon as Sunday when Biden returns from his trip to Japan for the G-7 meetings.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) stock rose more than 1% as America's largest big box retailer reported higher same-store sales growth than Wall Street had anticipated. Walmart also boosted its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast from a range of $5.90-$6.05 to a range of $6.10-$6.20.</p>
      <p>In Asia, shares nudged lower, weighed down by China and Hong Kong stocks due to concerns over the stuttering recovery in the world's second-biggest economy, although Japan's Nikkei clocked a near 33-year peak.</p>
      <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.77% to 30,808 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong lost 1.31% to 19,468. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) slipped 0.41% to 3,283 points.</p>
      <p>So far this year, the Nikkei has gained around 19%, outpacing other major markets. But despite the recent rally, the Nikkei is still below its all-time peak over 36,000 set in 1989.</p>
      <p>Japan’s core inflation nationwide rose 3.4% year-on-year in April, in line with forecasts by economists polled by Reuters.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) has not managed to pounce on US debt ceiling optimism as with many G10 currencies as investors remain in the cautious’ camp, with sterling trading at $1.2414.</p>
      <p>Sterling (GBPEUR=X) was muted against the euro, trading at €1.1512.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) gained ground and was trading at around $76 per barrel with oil prices set to record their first weekly gain since mid-April as sentiment about future demand improves amid signs there may be progress on the debt ceiling negotiations in Congress.</p>
      <p>“I think markets have been pricing out the risks of a US debt default, which translates to a more risk-on environment and some dip-buying in Brent crude from previous oversold conditions,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared early losses, rising 0.3% at closing bell. The index built support at the 50-day moving average, but health leaders in the Dow lagged.</p>
    	<p>On Thursday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he sees the path to "come to an agreement" on the debt ceiling. Experts have stated that the U.S. could default as early as June 1 without a budget agreement. McCarthy sees the vote taking place as early as next week.</p>	
    	<p>The S&P 500 eyed February's high of 4195 as it rose 1%. The Nasdaq gained 1.5% and hit a high for the year to date. NYSE and Nasdaq volume rose vs. Wednesday, according to preliminary data. The small-cap Russell 2000 index gained 0.6%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil continued its fall and traded at $72 per barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6 basis points to 3.64%.</p>	
      <p>Tech leaders Nvidia (NVDA), Lam Research (LRCX), Cadence (CDNS) and ASML (ASML) rose. Nvidia and ASML are IBD Leaderboard stocks, while Lam and Cadence are IBD SwingTrader names.</p>
      <p>Fed officials weighed in on a possible rate hike in June.</p>
      <p>Dallas Fed President Lori Logan said she does not find enough data to warrant pausing hikes yet. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester maintained her stance that the economy is not at a point where holding rates steady would be justified.</p>
      <p>The CME FedWatch Tool sees a 40.2% chance of a 25-basis-point hike in June, taking the effective rate to 5.25%-5.5%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders In Focus</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones component Walmart (WMT) rose after same-store sales growth beat expectations and the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. Shares are in a buy zone that goes up to 155.75, according to IBD MarketSmith.</p>
      <p>Tech leader Cisco Systems (CSCO) pared early losses and gained over 1% into the close after strong earnings. Weaker orders in the fiscal third quarter raised concerns. Shares cleared the 200-day moving average late Thursday.</p>
      <p>Outside the Dow Jones, Alibaba (BABA) fell below converged 50- and 200-day lines after earnings disappointed. The Chinese e-commerce platform approved a spinoff of its cloud segment, Cloud Intelligence Group, through a stock dividend distribution to shareholders. Public listings of its logistics and retail operations are also pending.</p>
      <p>Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) broke out at 137.53 after earnings. The video game publisher sees strong growth, with net bookings hitting $8 billion in fiscal 2025.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Global stocks traded mixed Wednesday as investors mulled U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and wider economic growth worries.</p>
    	<p>It was a different story in Japan, where economic data proved to be the final catalysts that pushed Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 above 30,000 for the first time since September 2021, with the index closing up 0.8% at its highest level in 33 years.</p>	
    	<p>Data showed that the Japanese economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), grew 1.6% in the first quarter of 2023 on an annualized basis, beating expectations of 1.1% growth and marking the first increase in three quarters.</p>	
    	<p>“The Nikkei wasn’t blown off course by American worries, with investors gaining a big spring in their step,” said Susannah Streeter, an analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. “The economy has bounced back from pandemic woes … as consumers freed from restrictions splashed the cash and tourists returned.”</p>
      <p>It was a cloudier picture across global stocks more broadly, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sagging 2.1% and the Shanghai Composite losing 0.2%. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 was trading just above flat, with the Paris CAC 40 slipping 0.1% into the red and Frankfurt’s DAX gaining 0.3%.</p>
      <p>Investors have continued to monitor the state of talks over the looming U.S. debt ceiling, which has ramifications for worldwide markets. Global growth concerns also continued to simmer in the background, with data out of China over the past two weeks showing a weakening domestic picture in the world’s second-largest economy and signs of slowing global demand for goods.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Losses grew in late trading for the Dow Jones Industrial Average as component Home Depot (HD) disappointed investors with its latest report. Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought shares in a financial stock despite the banking crisis. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blasted President Joe Biden ahead of their debt ceiling meeting.</p>
    	<p>Some stocks tried to break out despite the mixed action. Rambus (RMBS), GMS (GMS) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all tested entries.</p>	
	    <p>Treasury yields moved higher. The 10-year yield rose three basis point to 3.54% while the two-year yield spiked seven basis points to 4.08%, making the yield curve more inverted.</p>
      <h3>Biden Changes Plan After McCarthy Debt Ceiling Jibe</h3>	
	    <p>The long-awaited debt ceiling meeting between congressional leaders and President Joe Biden took place this afternoon.</p>
      <p>McCarthy went on the offensive ahead of the powwow, taking a shot at the president's schedule. Biden is getting set to leave the country on Wednesday for a three-day G-7 meeting in Japan.</p>
      <p>"We've got 16 more days to go," McCarthy told reporters. "I don't think I would spend eight days somewhere out of the country."</p>
      <p>Biden responded by cutting short his overseas engagements. He will now return to the U.S. on Sunday instead of heading to other planned visits to Papua New Guinea and Australia, a source told NBC News.</p>
      <p>Democrats want the debt ceiling raised unconditionally, while Republicans are looking to secure government spending cuts before agreeing. After the meeting McCarthy said there is "a lot of work to do in a short amount of time." He also said they will "work hard to make this come to fruition."</p>
      <p>He also said a member of the Biden administration will be working with a member of his team to hammer out a deal.</p>
      <p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Monday the U.S. could become unable to pay its bills as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn't act.</p>
      <p>Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said the debt ceiling issue is raising anxiety among investors.</p>
      <p>"Wall Street is bracing for something bad to happen, but no one has an idea on what will be that catalyst," he said in a note to clients. "It could be a debt ceiling impasse, persistent banking fears, or a much weaker consumer as sticky inflation becomes more noticeable."</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq Reverses Lower As Small Caps Slump</h3>
      <p>The Nasdaq fared better than the other major indexes but still fell 0.2% as indexes faded in late trading. Baidu (BIDU) impressed with a gain of 4% following its earnings report.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.6%. Caesars Entertainment (CZR) lagged with a dip of 6.9%.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 sectors were mixed with a bias to the negative. Communication services and technology were the top performers. Real estate and energy lagged the most.</p>
      <p>Small caps were mauled by the bears, with the Russell 2000 plunging 1.4%. Growth stocks also lagged, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) losing 1.1%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Home Depot Disappoints, Nike Lags</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones lagged the other major indexes. It ended the day down 336 points, or 1%.</p>
      <p>Home Depot fell 2.1% following its latest quarterly report, though earnings were not actually the issue.</p>
      <p>Home Depot reported a better-than-expected EPS drop of 6.6% to $3.82 as sales fell 4% to $37.26 billion. It was the retailer's worst sales miss in decades.</p>
      <p>The home improvement retailer expects revenue and same-store sales to decrease 2% and 5%, respectively, compared with fiscal 2022. This was worse than its previous guidance.</p>
      <p>Despite this, it was Nike (NKE) that was the worst performer on the Dow Jones today, falling 2.8%.</p>
      <p>Microsoft (MSFT) led the upside as it rose 0.7%. It is currently extended, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
      <h3>Warren Buffett Buys This Finance Stock</h3>
      <p>Many investors like to keep track of 13F filings for stock ideas. And it has emerged that Berkshire Hathaway has taken out a new stake in Capital One Financial (COF).</p>
      <p>Berkshire Hathaway has reported a purchase of over 9.9 million shares in a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>The latest Warren Buffett stock is one of the largest issuers of credit cards in the U.S., and also provides consumer and commercial banking products.</p>
      <p>COF stock closed off highs for the day but still gained 2.1%. Nevertheless, it holds a poor IBD Composite Rating of 32 out of 99.</p>
      <p>In addition to its new holding, Berkshire Hathaway also increased positions in Bank of America (BAC) and Apple (AAPL) by 2% each. It also boosted its Occidental Petroleum (OXY) position by 8%.</p>
      <h3>RH Stock Plummets On Buffett Axing</h3>
      <p>But it was not all good news for stocks following the latest changes to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.</p>
      <p>RH (RH), formerly Restoration Hardware, plunged on news that Buffett dumped the stock in the last quarter. It seems the Oracle of Omaha is not enamored with the luxury furniture retailer's prospects with a possible recession looming.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2022, Berkshire owned 2.36 million shares in the company, which is led by Chairman and CEO Gary Friedman.</p>
      <p>RH stock ended the day down 8.8%. It flashed a sell signal as it plummeted below the 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>The stock holds an RS Rating of 31. It is down a moderate 4.7% so far in 2023.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: AMD Stock Among Breakouts</h3>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices cleared a 102.53 cup-base entry and closed below that level. It is actionable as high as 107.66.</p>
      <p>AMD stock popped after a regulatory filing showed hedge fund Third Point, which is run by activist investor Daniel Loeb, has taken a 1 million-share stake.</p>
      <p>Overall strong performance is reflected in AMD's IBD Composite Rating of 92.</p>
      <p>Rambus saw its relative strength line reach a fresh high after it cleared a buy point of 51.98. RMBS has a perfect Composite Rating of 99. Big Money has also been buying of late, as evidenced by the stock's B Accumulation/Distribution Rating.</p>
      <p>Construction supplies play GMS is just below its 62.29 entry. Institutional ownership is very high: 76% of its stock is owned by funds, according to MarketSmith data.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>A sizable dip in the innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite is the perfect excuse for investors to pounce on some phenomenal deals.</p>
    	<p>If there's a lesson to be learned from 2022, it's that Wall Street is anything but predictable in the short term. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell into a bear market last year, with the growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -0.35%) performing the worst (a loss of 33%).</p>	
    	<p>The good news is that the stock market becomes quite predictable when you step back and pan out. Despite stock market corrections being somewhat common throughout history, every previous significant downturn in the major U.S. indexes, including the Nasdaq Composite, has eventually been cleared away by a bull market. As long as you're willing to use time as an ally, corrections and bear market dips can be golden opportunities.</p>	
    	<p>With growth stocks getting clobbered in 2022, they're a genius place to consider putting your money to work. What follows are five exceptional growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
      <h3>Pinterest</h3>
      <p>The first incredible growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market drop is social media company Pinterest (PINS -0.37%). Although recessionary fears are currently weighing on Pinterest's ad-driven operating model, this is a company with well-defined competitive edges.</p>
      <p>The first thing you'll note about Pinterest is the company's steady monthly active user (MAU) growth. Though MAUs rose quickly during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and declined into early 2022 as vaccines hit pharmacy shelves, Pinterest's user growth has been relatively steady when examined over a five-year period. User growth isn't everything for social media companies, but it's a number Wall Street and investors are closely monitoring.</p>
      <p>What's arguably even more important is that Pinterest hasn't struggled to monetize its active users. Putting aside the 1% decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) during the first quarter, ARPU jumped by a reasonably healthy 10% in 2022 despite it being a challenging year for advertising. Multiple years of ARPU data has shown that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to get their message in front of Pinterest's growing user base.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Pinterest's operating model ensures it won't be hurt by data-tracking software changes from app developers. Whereas many social media platforms rely on data-tracking tools to help advertisers target users, the entire point of Pinterest's site is for users to willingly and freely share the things, places, and services that interest them. This is invaluable information the company can pass along to advertisers.</p>
      <p>With over $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet and a buyback program in place, Pinterest is ripe for the picking.</p>
      <h3>Exelixis</h3>
      <p>A second jaw-dropping growth stock you'll regret not scooping up with the Nasdaq falling is biotech stock Exelixis (EXEL -0.88%). Though lead drug Cabometyx failed to meet its primary endpoint in combination with Roche's Tecentriq in a recent kidney cancer trial, Exelixis has shown it has an abundance of catalysts for patient investors.</p>
      <p>As you can rightly imagine, Cabometyx is the superstar of this drug portfolio. U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals in first- and second-line renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and advanced previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma are more than enough to generate in excess of $1 billion in annual sales.</p>
      <p>Exelixis is also currently examining Cabometyx in around six dozen studies as a monotherapy or combination therapy. While some of these trials won't pan out, as referenced above, a handful will. A previous trial combining Cabometyx with Bristol Myers Squibb's cancer immunotherapy Opdivo led to the combination therapy gaining first-line RCC approval. Just a handful of wins is all it might take for Cabometyx to generate $2 billion or more in peak annual sales.</p>
      <p>Another exciting aspect of Exelixis is that its phenomenal cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet have allowed it to reignite its research engine. The company is developing a handful of novel cancer therapies, as well as forging collaborative/licensing partnerships with other drug developers to expand its future sales channels.</p>
      <p>A sustained double-digit growth rate and a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 20 make Exelixis an attractive buy.</p>
      <h3>Redfin</h3>
      <p>The third exceptional growth stock you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is technology-driven real estate company Redfin (RDFN -4.14%). While anything involving real estate is bound to face challenges in the near term, given that interest rates are rising at their fastest pace in decades, Redfin offers clear advantages over traditional real estate firms.</p>
      <p>The most front-and-center differentiator between Redfin and other real estate companies is cost. Whereas a traditional real estate agent takes between 2% and 3% in commission fees, Redfin charges its members either 1% or 1.5% depending on how much business was previously done with the company. With the average price of homes sold coming in at $516,500 in the first quarter of 2023, this up-to-2-percentage-point difference could save sellers over $10,000!</p>
      <p>Redfin also provides unparalleled personalization in the real estate space. For instance, Redfin's Concierge service works with homeowners to recommend upgrades and with vendors to make those renovations. This service helps owners maximize the sale price of their homes. Although Redfin closed its iBuying program, RedfinNow, it now has more time to focus on these higher-margin personalized services.</p>
      <p>Investors should also be excited about Redfin's acquisition of RentPath in April 2021. While homebuying was all the rage in 2021, renting is regaining its luster as mortgage rates rise. RentPath, the parent company of Rent.com and ApartmentGuides.com, has seen rising revenue early in 2023, according to Redfin.</p>
      <p>After accounting for 0.78% of first-quarter U.S. existing home sales, Redfin has plenty of room for market share expansion.</p>
      <h3>Innovative Industrial Properties</h3>
      <p>A fourth shockingly solid growth stock you'll regret not scooping up on the Nasdaq bear market decline is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR -2.03%), more commonly known as IIP. Though there have been recent concerns about rent delinquencies for IIP, the company appears to be navigating these challenges relatively easily.</p>
      <p>What investors are going to love about IIP is the relative predictability of the business. As of March 31, the company's portfolio consisted of 103 operating properties and an additional five under development. Combined, that's around 8.8 million square feet of rentable space, with a weighted-average lease length of 15.1 years.</p>
      <p>In January and February, there had been some concern with IIP collecting just 92% of its rents on time. But as of March 31, the company announced it had collected 98% of its contractually due base rent for the quarter. Divesting certain assets, reworking master-lease agreements, and possibly even shifting existing leases to new multi-state operators (MSOs) are tools available to IIP to keep its consistent cash flow rolling in.</p>
      <p>The company's lease structure also makes it special. Innovative Industrial Properties' entire portfolio is triple net leased (NNN leased). Triple net leased properties require tenants to cover the cost of utilities, maintenance, taxes, and insurance. While NNN leases result in lower rents for IIP, it also removes any sticker shocks from unexpected costs.</p>
      <p>Sporting a yield of greater than 10%, IIP is an income seeker's dream come true.</p>
      <h3>Baidu</h3>
      <p>The fifth exceptional growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is China-based internet search giant Baidu (BIDU -3.30%). Although China stocks come with added investment risks, Baidu's search engine dominance and innovation easily snuff out these concerns.</p>
      <p>For much of the past three years, Baidu has been held back by China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's zero-COVID mitigation strategy led to stringent lockdowns that continually crippled supply chains. But with China ending this controversial strategy in December, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product is free to, once again, spread its wings. While the rebound could be a bit bumpy, it favors industry-leading growth stocks like Baidu over the long term.</p>
      <p>Baidu's biggest cash-flow generator continues to be its internet search engine. As of April 2023, Baidu accounted for approximately 40% of all internet searches in China, based on data provided by GlobalStats. Doubling up its next-closest competitor in market share makes it likely that Baidu will possess strong ad-pricing power more often than not.</p>
      <p>But there's more to like over the long run than just Baidu's moneymaking search engine. Baidu has invested heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), and those investments are beginning to pay off. The company's AI Cloud and AI-driven autonomous robotaxi company (Apollo Go) helped non-marketing revenue jump 11% in a challenging 2022 for China. Look for Baidu's AI segments to drive its organic growth in the years to come.</p>
      <p>With a number of headwinds now put into the rearview mirror, Baidu looks like a steal at just 11 times consensus earnings for 2024.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down modestly near midday Friday, along with other major stock indexes. Chevron (CVX) was an early leader in the Dow Jones, along with Cisco Systems[ticker symb=CSCO]. But Salesforce (CRM), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Nike (NKE) lagged with losses of at least 1%.</p>
    	<p>The Nasdaq composite also lost ground, dropping around 0.5%.</p>	
    	<p>Small caps outperformed early, lifting the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) to a gain of nearly 0.7%. But the small-cap ETF faded to a loss of around 0.4% at midday. The financial services group, which includes regional banks, is the fourth highest-weighted sector in IWM, at just over 13%.</p>	
    	<p>Meta Platforms (META) was an early gainer but it faded off highs. Late Thursday, the large-cap technology leader released new artificial intelligence tools to help advertisers build ad campaigns.</p>
      <p>In the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) rallied 3% and reversed lower after CEO Elon Musk said a new CEO will take over at Twitter in six weeks. Musk didn't name the person, but CNBC reported that NBCUniversal's advertising chief Linda Yaccarino is in advanced talks for the position. TSLA stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average, a potential resistance level to watch.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield was up 3 basis points to around 3.43%. After key inflation data this week, federal funds futures traders widely expect the Fed to stand pat at the June and July meetings, leaving the interest rate unchanged at 5% to 5.25%. At the September meeting, traders think there's a 75% chance that the Fed will cut by 25 basis points to 4.75% to 5%.</p>
      <p>Gold edged lower to around $2,015 an ounce. Franco-Nevada (FNV) is holding near its 21-day exponential moving average as it sits just below a 158.98 buy point.</p>
      <h3>Inside the Dow Jones</h3>
      <p>American Express (AXP) was an early gainer in the Dow Jones, but the stock remains on a sharp downtrend. Sellers have hit AXP stock hard after its April 20 earnings report.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan reversed slightly lower, continuing recently-volatile price swings. JPM stock showed bullish action when it rallied above its 50-day line last month. But sellers hit the May 1 gap-up hard, triggering a series of down days.</p>
      <p>Outside the Dow Jones, several growth stocks made solid gains.</p>
      <p>Inside the MarketSmith Growth 250, First Solar (FSLR) soared more than 20% after announcing the acquisition of Europe's Evolar. The small deal, worth up to $80 million, will strengthen First Solar's position in thin film photovoltaics used in solar panels. The buy will also give FSLR its first research and development facility in Europe.</p>
      <p>Other top gainers included TriNet Group (TNET), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Penumbra (PEN) and Insulet (PODD).</p>
      <p>Heavy-volume decliners in the MarketSmith Growth 250 included AngloGold Ashanti (AU), TG Therapeutics (TGTX) and fitness chain Life Time Holdings (LTH).</p>
      <p>Fluence Energy (FLNC) was a top gainer in the IBD 50, but the stock fell off highs. FLNC's weekly gain now stands at 25%. Earlier in the week, the provider of energy storage products reported $698.2 million in revenue, up 104% from a year ago.</p>
      <p>Celsius (CELH) was poised for its eighth straight gain after gapping up on earnings Wednesday. Adjusted profit surged 344%, while its revenue growth rate accelerated from Q4, rising 95% year over year to $259.9 million.</p>
      <p>Chip firm Rambus (RMBS) also gained in the IBD 50. After a bullish accumulation week, Rambus will have a six-week base in place by Friday's close. RMBS stock is less than 5% off its high.</p>

    	<p>Bank stocks helped lift the S&P 500 — which sank near its 50-day line earlier this week  — by 1.9%. But the tech-dominated Nasdaq was the biggest gainer at the closing bell, rising nearly 2.3%. The Dow climbed 1.7%.</p>	
    	<p>Volume on the NYSE and the Nasdaq was lower compared with the same time on Thursday, which dampened the significance of Friday's rally.</p>	
    	<p>Crude oil rose over 4% to trade at $71.51 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 10 basis points to 3.44%. The energy sector was the best performing in the S&P 500 Friday.</p>
      <p>The small-cap Russell 2000 showed a hefty gain of 2.4% while the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF outperformed, rising over 2.5%.</p>
      <p>The economy added 253,000 jobs in April, much higher than views for 178,000. An unemployment rate of 3.4% in April was lower than estimates of 3.6%, the U.S. Labor Department reported early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Stocks Moving Today</h3>
      <p>Regional banks rose after falling sharply on Thursday. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) rebounded over 80%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) showed a 50% gain at closing time. Zion Bancorp (ZION) also surged and made up all of Thursday's plunge, and more.</p>
      <p>InterDigital (IDCC) broke out of a flat base with a 75.84 entry, according to IBD MarketSmith chart analysis. The wireless technology company blew past Q1 estimates. Sales grew a whopping 100% while earnings outpaced sales growth with a 325% increase. The relative strength line is also at a new high. The stock is now extended.</p>
      <p>Coinbase (COIN) jumped 18% after earnings came out late Thursday. But the stock has some work to do before it can clear its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Fintech stock Block (SQ) fell 2%, despite strong earnings and outlook thanks to its popular Cash App.</p>
      <p>Carvana (CVNA) surged 25% in strong volume after earnings and cleared its 50-day line after the used car retail chain showed smaller losses than a year ago. Lyft (LYFT) plunged 20%, falling below its 50-day line after earnings were announced and management lowered guidance for the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Strong results sent IBD 50 stock DraftKings (DKNG) surging to a 52-week high Friday. The stock had broken out of a cup base with a buy point of 21.72 ahead of earnings and is now extended.</p>
      <p>Atlassian (TEAM) indicated slowing cloud computing growth despite a strong quarterly report. TEAM fell 10% in heavy volume.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stock In Focus</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones tech leader Apple rose on strong iPhone sales in the first quarter. The tech titan is hitting highs seen last in August 2022.</p>
      <p>Outside Dow Jones, Dynatrace (DT) is building a cup base with a buy point of 48.10 with earnings due on May 17. The recent Stock of the Day and IBD SwingTrader stock cleared a potential early entry at 43.42 as it breaks a trendline.</p>
      <p>Starbucks (SBUX) is rebounding from the 50-day after diving on earnings Wednesday. It is trading below the 110.93 buy point of last week's breakout but may be trying to climb back to it.</p>
      <p>Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will report Q1 earnings and hold a shareholder meeting Saturday as the stock builds a base with a buy point of 362.20. The Warren Buffett portfolio sold several bank holdings ahead of the banking crisis, according to reports. Analysts polled by FactSet expect 12.5% growth in earnings per share to $3.58.</p>
      <p>Shockwave Medical (SWAV) is approaching a 300.10 entry in a cup with handle with earnings due on Monday.</p>
      <p>Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is also on watch as it holds the 50-day line ahead of earnings Wednesday. Axon (AXON) has earnings on Tuesday and is testing the 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>Dow Jones component Walt Disney (DIS) is rebounding from the 50-day line ahead of earnings Wednesday.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>These growth-driven innovators are attractively priced and begging to be bought.</p>
	    <p>Things can change pretty quickly on Wall Street. In 2021, stocks could seemingly do no wrong, with all three major indexes cresting to new highs. In 2022, these same indexes all plunged into respective bear markets, with the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 -- an index comprised of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange -- losing a third of their value.</p>	
	    <p>However, big declines often yield big opportunity for investors. No matter how painful a decline has been for a major stock index throughout history, that loss was eventually (key word!) fully recouped during a bull market. It means the short-term pain the Nasdaq 100 has endured is the ideal time for long-term investors to pounce.</p>	
	    <p>What follows are three Nasdaq 100 stocks that stand out as surefire buys in May.</p>
      <h3>Datadog</h3>
      <p>The first Nasdaq 100 stock that makes for a phenomenal buy in May following a miserable 2022 is cloud-based observability company Datadog (DDOG 14.52%).</p>
      <p>Probably the biggest knock against Datadog is the growing expectation the U.S. economy will fall into a recession in the not-too-distant future. With the Federal Reserve now modeling a "mild recession" into its outlook for later this year, there's the concern that demand for anything involving software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, including monitoring, could taper.</p>
      <p>Thankfully for Datadog, it's benefiting from macro and company-specific catalysts, which should help it successfully navigate a potential economic downturn.</p>
      <p>In terms of the former, the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the labor force. Despite some people returning to the office, more folks than ever are working remotely. This historically large remote workforce has increased the importance of application monitoring in a very short time. Gartner expects Datadog's addressable market for observability will catapult by roughly 50% to $62 billion between 2022 and 2026.</p>
      <p>On a company-specific level, Datadog pointed out in February that its key growth driver is still in its very early stages. Corporate cloud spending as a percentage of global infrastructure technology spend is expected to grow from around 8% in 2021 to an estimated 20% by 2026.  Datadog's observability opportunity is still in its early innings.</p>
      <p>But what's been particularly impressive is Datadog's ability to score big clients. The number of customers generating at least $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) skyrocketed from 11 in 2017 to 317 in 2022. Further, 85% of the company's total ARR now derives from the 12% of customers (approximately 2,780) with at least $100,000 in ARR (note, this write-up was done prior to Datadog's first-quarter earnings release on May 4). Add-on sales from these big fish should help Datadog sustain a sales growth rate of 25%, if not higher.</p>
      <p>Despite a seemingly frothy valuation based on the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, Datadog's price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 1.5 suggests it's an attractive deal.</p>
      <h3>JD.com</h3>
      <p>A second magnificent Nasdaq 100 growth stock that's a surefire buy in May is China-based e-commerce company JD.com (JD 3.17%).</p>
      <p>China stocks have had a rough go in numerous respects since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The zero-COVID mitigation strategy in that country led to three years of stringent, unpredictable lockdowns that hurt supply chains in most sectors and industries. Thankfully, things have changed.</p>
      <p>Following domestic protests, China's regulators ended the controversial zero-COVID strategy in December. Though it could take some time for China's citizens to build up some degree of vaccine-based or natural immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, this was a necessary move by regulators to jump-start the world's No. 2 economy. This removes a big overhang for a growth stalwart like JD.com.</p>
      <p>There's also been some concern about JD getting into a price war with China's other key e-commerce players, such as Alibaba (BABA 1.24%). However, these skeptics are overlooking a sizable difference in the operating models between Alibaba and JD.</p>
      <p>The former generates the majority of its sales from third-party marketplaces, whereas JD predominantly operates as a direct-to-consumer retailer. In other words, it's handling the inventory and logistics necessary for order-to-doorstep delivery. JD's operating model gives it greater control over its expenses than Alibaba, which I expect will lead to better operating margin and a higher sustained organic growth rate.</p>
      <p>JD.com also has an opportunity to unlock shareholder value by following in Alibaba's footsteps and spinning off key assets. In late March, JD announced plans to spin off its property and industrial segments and list them on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Doing so should make future operating results even easier for investors to understand.</p>
      <p>Lastly, JD.com is cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Shares can be purchased for just over 10 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for 2024. Even taking into account the added risks associated with China stocks, JD's superior growth rate makes its stock a steal.</p>
      <h3>PayPal Holdings</h3>
      <p>The third Nasdaq 100 stock that's a surefire buy in May is none other than fintech stock PayPal Holdings (PYPL 0.53%).</p>
      <p>Arguably the biggest issue for PayPal is the historically high inflation consumers and businesses have been dealing with over the past year. Rapidly rising prices for goods and services threatens to reduce the purchasing power of low-earning workers. It could also lower the number of transactions completed on PayPal or Venmo, the company's two core digital transaction networks.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, though, PayPal has struggled far less than you'd imagine. Total payment volume (TPV) reached $1.36 trillion in 2022, which represents a 13% increase from the prior-year period, excluding currency movements. Keep in mind that this 13% growth rate occurred with inflation at a four-decade high and U.S. gross domestic product shrinking in the first half of 2022. It's a testament to the growth potential of digital transactions and suggests a return to 20%-plus annual TPV growth is possible once the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders again.</p>
      <p>But as I've previously pointed out, PayPal's greatest strength is its user engagement. At the end of 2020, active accounts were completing an average of 40.9 transactions over the trailing-12-month (ttm) period. That compares to the 51.4 average transactions per active account over the ttm at the end of 2022. Since PayPal is primarily a fee-driven business, more transactions will almost certainly mean higher gross profit for the company.</p>
      <p>Although PayPal is a growth company, CEO Dan Schulman isn't oblivious to his company's near-term challenges. That's why Schulman outlined plans to reduce annual expenditures by at least $1.3 billion in 2023. Further, PayPal's board approved buying back up to $15 billion worth of common stock. Fewer shares outstanding should result in a boost to earnings per share, which would make PayPal's stock appear even more attractive.</p>
      <p>Like JD.com, PayPal is as cheap as it's ever been as a publicly traded company. Investors can scoop up shares right now for 13 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for 2024. For context, PayPal has averaged a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 over the past five years. This makes it nothing short of a screaming bargain.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 and European markets opened higher on Friday as investors continued to assess the impact of rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB) and US Federal Reserve.</p>
    	<p>Traders are also digesting European Central Bank (ECB) inflation projections and April construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) figures – which showed the UK sector growing, despite the weakest housebuilding activity in almost two years.</p>	
    	<h3>FTSE 100 and European stocks</h3>
      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.64% to 7,751.70. The CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.56% to 7,381.68 points – and in Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) went up 0.66% to 15,837.98.</p>	
    	<p>“After slumping to a one-month low on Thursday, the FTSE 100 is trading higher lifted by British Airways’ parent company IAG which has taken to the skies following first quarter earnings,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.</p>
      <p>BP was also at the top of the FTSE 100 basket after the energy giant reported a first-quarter profit of $4.96bn this week, which beat analysts’ expectations of $4.3bn.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia markets</h3>
      <p>In Asia, the major markets were mixed overnight with mainland Chinese markets slipping after a weak Caixin services PMI reading for April.</p>
      <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.12% to 29,157.95 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong rose 0.49% to 20,046.91. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was in the red, down 0.61% to 3,329.51 points.</p>
      <p>In the US, all three indexes closed the session lower as investors fretted over more turmoil ahead in the banking sector – and digested the impact of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates again.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) dropped 0.86% to 33,127.74 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.72% to 4,061.22 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) also declined - by 0.49% to 11,966.40.</p>
      <p>Shares of PacWest (PACW) dropped 50%, while Western Alliance (WAL) stock dropped nearly 40% after the lender denied that executives are exploring a possible sale.</p>
      <h3>Pound</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) gained against the US dollar by 0.50% to 1.26 as traders opted for the currency amid fresh concern in the US banking sector. Against the euro, the sterling (GBPEUR=X) also rose, by 0.18% to 1.14.</p>
      <h3>Oil prices</h3>
      <p>In commodities, crude prices edged higher on Friday after losing ground this week.</p>
      <p>US crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), rose 1.14% to $69.34 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) gained 1.19% to $73.36 a barrel.</p>
      <p>“However, oil is still on track for its third week of losses reflecting uncertainty about the global economic outlook and the threat of weaker demand, particularly from China,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.</p>
      <h3>Economic data</h3>
      <p>The monthly US employment report, or non-farm payrolls, is due out later showing how many jobs the country’s economy created in April.</p>
      <p>“Expectations for a strong headline number have risen following the ADP employment report on Wednesday indicating that 296,000 jobs were added to the private sector last month. This has encouraged optimism that the monthly employment report might even show that more than 300,000 jobs were added to the US economy in April,” Jameel Ahmad, chief analyst at CompareBroker.io, said.</p>
      <p>Ahmad also noted that global markets could decline, even if the latest employment report presents a blockbuster number, as a resilient jobs report validates the narrative of the Federal Reserve to continue not giving too much away when it comes to the future monetary policy outlook.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, investors were also taking in the latest activity data in Britain's construction sector, which increased in April.</p>
      <p>The S&P Global/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers' Index for the construction industry came in at 51.1 in April, up from 50.7 in March.</p>
      <p>However, growth was lopsided as residential house-building suffered its steepest decline since May 2020 as a result of weaker demand and higher mortgage rates.</p>
      <p>Also on Friday, the European Central Bank released its quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters, a key input in policy deliberations.</p>
      <p>It revealed the ECB now sees 2023 inflation at 5.6%, down from the 5.9% expected three months ago, while the 2024 projection was cut to 2.6% from 2.7%.</p>
      <p>The 2025 figure was lifted to 2.2% from 2.1% and the "longer term" figure, which refers to 2027, was kept at 2.1%.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, retail sales in the eurozone have also been released by Eurostat.</p>
      <p>The data showed retail sales volumes in the 20 nations sharing the euro currency fell by 1.2% in March from the previous month, outpacing the 0.1% drop seen in a Reuters poll of economists.</p>
      <h3>Adidas earnings</h3>
      <p>The sports retail giant reported first quarter sales of €5.27bn on Friday, beating analysts’ expectations. Adidas (ADS.DE) put it down to strong demand for the Terrace shoe as well as the Samba and Gazelle.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, its operating profit hit €60m, quadrupling consensus forecasts for €15m. However, it reported a net loss from continuing operations of €24m – and gross margins declined.</p>
      <p>“There appears to be green shoots of optimism for the sportswear giant which is still reeling from the Yeezy / Kanye West crisis after its partnership with Ye ended last year. This resulted in a €400m dash to sales, hitting North America hardest and leaving Adidas with a huge pile of unsold shoe inventory,” Scholar commented.</p>
      <p>Adidas also said it has been struggling with cost inflation and the softening consumer backdrop, which has led to greater discounting.</p>
      <p>“Although shares fell sharply in October after its Yeezy deal terminated, shares have been rebounding over the last six months. Investors are also optimistic about new CEO Bjørn Gulden thanks to his impressive CV including his recent nine-year term at Puma at which he helped spearhead the brand’s revival,” Scholar added.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The FTSE 100 index today regained lost ground during a busy session for blue-chip updates.</p>
    	<p>Alongside the latest developments at Lloyds Banking Group, Flutter Entertainment and Barratt Developments, markets have reacted to the FCA’s decision last night to reform listing rules in order to make it easier for companies to list in London.</p>	
    	<p>In the US, meanwhile, investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision amid hopes that tonight’s quarter point increase will be the last in the cycle.</p>	
    	<h3>FTSE 100 Live Wednesday</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal Reserve to hike rates again</li>
        <li>Lloyds profit ahead of hopes at £2.3bn</li>
        <li>Barratt Developments sees signs of recovery</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Price of fish and chips jumps a fifth</h3>
      <p>12:24 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>The cost of fish and chips has shot up by almost a fifth and the price of children’s clothes has rocketed, according to a new interactive tool showing Britons how much their shopping bills have surged over the past year.</p>
      <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has launched a comparison tool to show how much everyday items have increased during the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
      <h3>Sharp fall in oil prices</h3>
      <p>11:54 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Oil prices plunged toward $70 a barrell, hitting the share prices of London’s supermajors.</p>
      <p>Brent Crude fell by 2.4% to $71.82, the lowest since March, amid wider concerns about the economy.</p>
      <p>“Oil prices have been crushed again over the last 24 hours as US regional bank shares sold off heavily and fuelled fears of a more significant economic downturn this year,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for the UK and EMEA at OANDA, said.</p>
      <p>He added that he believed the decline should be a warning to the Federal Reserve to pause its rate hikes: “The warning signs are there that investors are extremely anxious about the global economic prospects, particularly the US, and the data is slowly catching up which should deter the Fed from hiking today but it in all likelihood won't.”</p>
      <h3>Lloyds beats profit forecasts as lenders now look toward BOE rate hike</h3>
      <p>11:39 , Michael Hunter</p>
      <p>Lloyds Banking Group became the latest big-name high street lender to beat profit forecasts today, in the finale of a strong reporting season for UK financial companies, which have shrugged off the crisis seen in the sector in the US and Europe.</p>
      <p>The country’s biggest single mortgage lender, which has 26 million customers in total, reported profit before tax of £2.3 billon for the first quarter, up from £1.5 billion in the same period a year ago. It was higher than the £1.95 billion forecast by City experts.</p>
      <h3>Card Factory sales boosted as shoppers embrace High Street</h3>
      <p>10:50 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Card Factory has recorded a 27.1% full-year sales jump, with physical shops performing better than online for the retailer.</p>
      <p>The company saw annual revenue reach £463.4 million in the year to January 31. Comparable sales growth was 6.7%.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Darcy Willson-Rymer said: “These strong results reflect positive momentum across the business, including notable progress on our strategic growth initiatives, buoyed by the marked shift of customer spend back towards the high street.”</p>
      <h3>BP down again but FTSE 100 higher, Pearson rebounds 6%</h3>
      <p>10:24 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>Lufthansa’s forecast of a summer “travel boom” failed to lift airline stocks today as investors focused on the outlook for cargo earnings.</p>
      <p>Shares in IAG, which trades as British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, faded 3% or 4.55p to 147.5p despite Lufthansa reporting a 73% jump in passenger revenues as demand returns to above pre-pandemic levels on short and medium haul leisure routes.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Carsten Spohr added: “After a good first quarter in which we were able to significantly improve our result, we now expect a travel boom in the summer as well as a new record in our traffic revenue for the year as a whole.”</p>
      <p>In contrast to passenger routes, Lufthansa said cargo earnings fell sharply as air freight rates stabilised after their boost from Covid supply chain disruption. Lufthansa shares dropped 5%, offsetting an otherwise positive session for European markets.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 index put back some of Tuesday’s 1% loss by adding 24.23 points to 7,797.26, helped by a rise of 6% or 49p to 803p for education publisher Pearson.</p>
      <p>The recovery from yesterday’s 14.5% slide came as Deutsche Bank reiterated a 1140p target price and said there was limited read-across to Monday’s warning by US-based Chegg over the impact of AI chatbots on its homework-help services.</p>
      <p>There was no such bounceback for BP as shares fell another 6.9p to 481.45p, adding to yesterday’s 8% slide when concerns over the outlook trumped forecast-beating profits.</p>
      <p>It was a similar story for Sensodyne-to-Panadol consumer health firm Haleon after it posted revenues growth of 13.7%. The performance was overshadowed by Pfizer’s plans to sell down its 32% stake, causing Haleon to fall 4% or 13.3p to 339.7p.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 250 index improved 65.12 points to 19,379.35, led by TI Fluid Systems as a surge in vehicle production boosted first quarter revenues. The shares jumped 15% or 16.2p to 124.2p.</p>
      <h3>Nisa announces plans to open another 400 shops</h3>
      <p>10:11 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Nisa has announced plans to open a further 400 shops this year as part of a continuing recruitment drive.</p>
      <p>The group has already opened 130 new stores this year and increased links with wholesale partners, including Greens Retail and MPK.</p>
      <p>Some 473 new shops were opened last year.</p>
      <h3>RS Group CFO quits amid ‘relationship with colleague’</h3>
      <p>09:38 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>The CFO of electrical parts distributor RS Group quit with immediate effect today after admitting to a “personal relationship with a colleague”.</p>
      <p>David Egan said he would resign as “there have been some shortcomings of judgment” and his actions have “fallen short of the high standards expected of RS leadership”.</p>
      <p>RS chair Rona Fairhead said: “Following a thorough review, the board has accepted David’s resignation and in stepping down he recognises the importance of leaders setting and abiding by exemplary standards”.</p>
      <p>Fairhead also praised Egan’s work in “driving transformation” as CFO. Egan became CFO in 2016 with RS Group’s shares below 250p and left with them at 913p.</p>
      <p>Today, shares are down 2.6% to 889.4p.</p>
      <p>Egan made £1.8 million last year. He was set to earn up to £8.4 million this year, depending on performance.</p>
      <h3>British Land secures planning consent for urban logistics hub serving central London</h3>
      <p>09:36 , Joanna Bourke</p>
      <p>Paddington is set to get a new ultra-low carbon logistics development that could help satisfy post-pandemic demand for very speedy deliveries, after property giant British Land got the green light for its first “microhub”.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 developer has secured planning permission for a 121,000 square feet scheme called ‘The Box’ underneath its 5 Kingdom Street office tower. Construction is expected to complete by 2026.</p>
      <p>Flutter UK revenue soars as sector braces for safer gambling reforms</p>
      <p>08:32 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>Sky Bet and Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment saw UK revenue grow 17% in the final quarter before the Government announced safer gambling reforms that could cost the business £100 million a year.</p>
      <p>However, CEO Peter Jackson said that the reforms in question couldn’t yet be implemented in the way the Government has proposed without changes to technology or data rules.</p>
      <p>“It will be very difficult for us to implement these measures now,” he said. “It’s not clear what those will be and there will have to be technical reforms for those to be in place.</p>
      <p>The reform expected to have the largest  impact on revenue is the introduction of new ‘financial risk checks’, where gambling firms must perform ‘passive’ checks for credit black marks like county court judgements on customers depositing more than £125 in a day. Customers depositing £1,000 per day of £2,000 in 90 days will face closer scrutiny, which the Government likened to credit checks for borrowers.</p>
      <p>The Government has put out a consultation on the reforms. Jackson said it remained to be seen how the Government would simultaneously deliver its promises of protecting those at risk and not introducing too much friction for gamblers.</p>
      <p>“That’s the whole point of the consultation,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Pearson leads FTSE 100 recovery, Haleon falls 3%</h3>
      <p>08:31 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 index has recovered some of yesterday’s lost ground after adding 31.06 points to 7804.09 in today’s early dealings.</p>
      <p>Education coursework publisher Pearson led the way, having fallen 14% yesterday after US-based Chegg highlighted the impact of AI chatbots on the growth of its homework-help services.</p>
      <p>Pearson shares rallied 4% or 27.6p to 781.6p as Deutsche Bank analysts reiterated a 1140p target price and said the read-across from Chegg’s warning appeared to be limited.</p>
      <p>There was no such bounceback for BP shares, however, as the oil giant remained close to its opening mark at 488.25p. Concerns over the outlook sent shares more than 8% lower yesterday, even though the heavyweight stock beat expectations with first quarter profits.</p>
      <p>Among the blue-chips reporting today, Lloyds Banking Group edged up 0.2p to 47.88p and Flutter Entertainment improved 10p to 15,800p. Shares in consumer healthcare business Haleon dropped 3% or 11.45p to 341.55p, even though its first quarter results were in line with the guidance given alongside its AGM last month.</p>
      <h3>Barratt Developments points to signs of recovery in UK housing market</h3>
      <p>08:10 , Joanna Bourke</p>
      <p>Barratt Developments today said sales have picked up and it will meet City profit expectations, with the UK’s largest housebuilder adding to signs of a recovery in the residential market.</p>
      <p>Like rivals, the FTSE 100 company saw trading impacted after the aftermath of September’s mini Budget sent mortgage bills jumping, and on top of that a cost of living crisis has hit demand.</p>
      <p>In February Barratt reported early signs of recovery in reservation rates, and chief executive David Thomas has now said: “Whilst the economic backdrop remains difficult, we are pleased that more positive sales rates have been maintained through this period and we are now fully forward sold for FY23.”</p>
      <h3>US bank shares hit by more turbulence</h3>
      <p>07:46 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank index fell 4.5% yesterday and is now below where it was at the time of turmoil involving Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse at the end of March. The industry benchmark has lost about a quarter of its value in the year to date.</p>
      <p>With the crisis far from over after the weekend collapse of First Republic and the subsequent purchase of its assets by JP Morgan Chase, shares in US regional banks dropped sharply yesterday before steadying later in the session.</p>
      <p>PacWest Bancorp still ended the day 28% lower and Metropolitan Bank down by more than 20%, while heavyweight stocks also came under pressure as Citigroup and Bank of America both lost around 3% of their value.</p>
      <p>Concerns over the US debt ceiling have added to the jitters after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government could run out of money within a month unless Congress agrees to lift the statutory borrowing limit.</p>
      <h3>Aston Martin sales accelerate but net debt goes up a gear too</h3>
      <p>07:37 , Simon Hunt</p>
      <p>Aston Martin Lagonda posted a 27% jump in sales to just under £300 million for the first quarter of 2023 but saw its net debt increase by more than £100 million on the previous quarter to £868 million.</p>
      <p>The supercar maker said its DBS 770 Ultimate, the most powerful production Aston Martin ever, was unveiled in January 2023, with all 499 examples having already sold out.</p>
      <p>Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, boss of Aston Martin, said: “Since the start of the year, we have continued to see strong demand across our product range, with our current range of sports cars essentially sold out for the year.</p>
      <p>“The DBX707, the first car developed under my leadership, continues to receive broad media acclaim and, with a growing number incredibly satisfied customers, is strengthening the DBX orderbook in our all major markets, as well as our overall financial performance.”</p>
      <h3>Metro Bank reports first unadjusted profit</h3>
      <p>07:28 , Daniel O'Boyle</p>
      <p>In a quarter marked by banking turmoil, Metro Bank reported an unadjusted profit for the first time.</p>
      <p>The high street bank founded in 2010 reported an underlying profit in the final quarter of last year, but achieved profit on a statutory basis for the first time in Q1 as new current account openings rose by 18%.</p>
      <p>“Metro Bank has delivered a second consecutive quarter of underlying profitability and March has been our strongest month of performance since the turnaround commenced,” Boss Daniel Frumkin said. “We continued to attract more personal and business accounts, demonstrating the strong appeal of our service-led, community-based model.</p>
      <p>“Whilst we remain watchful of macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to optimise the business for improved risk-adjusted returns and are confident in our plan to become a sustainably profitable growth engine.”</p>
      <h3>Lloyds profit hits £2.3 billion in the first quarter beating City forecasts</h3>
      <p>07:25 , Michael Hunter</p>
      <p>Lloyds Banking Group has reported profit before tax of £2.3 billon for the first quarter, up from £1.5 billion in the same period a year ago.</p>
      <p>That was higher than the £1.95 billion forecast by City experts.</p>
      <p>Loans and advances to customers dropped by £2.6 billion to £452.3 billion. Customers pulled £2.2 billion out of accounts in the period, taking them to £473.1 billion. Retail current account balances dropped by £3.5 billion, partly due to “seasonal outflows” including tax bills due in January. Commercial banking deposits rose £2.7 billion, offsetting the decline in retail accounts.</p>
      <p>Its forecast-beating profits, from a period where the global banking sector was hit by crisis, were another sign that the turbulence from the collapse of Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank in the US left the UK sector untouched.</p>
      <p>Charlie Nunn, Lloyds chief executive, called the performance “solid”, but added: “The macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain. We know that this is challenging for many people. Our purpose driven strategy, alongside our financial strength, means we can continue to support our customers across the country.”</p>
      <p>The update from the high street lender brings the curtain down on reporting season for banks.</p>
      <h3>US shares under pressure, FTSE 100 steadies</h3>
      <p>07:20 , Graeme Evans</p>
      <p>US stock markets were sharply lower last night amid ongoing concerns over the health of the country’s regional banking sector.</p>
      <p>The prospect of tonight’s Federal Reserve interest rates decision and press conference also kept investors on the sidelines as the S&P 500 index fell 1.2%.</p>
      <p>The selling hit almost all sectors, with financial stocks among the worst affected after the collapse of First Republic and subsequent takeover by JP Morgan Chase.</p>
      <p>The impact of rising interest rates on financial stability will remain in focus today as US policymakers are widely expected to announce another quarter point hike in borrowing costs.</p>
      <p>However, traders will also be looking for any indication from Fed chairman Jerome Powell that a funds range of 5%-5.25% represents the peak of the cycle.</p>
      <p>The US jitters impacted trading in London yesterday, leaving the FTSE 100 index down by more than 1%. CMC Markets expects a calmer session this morning and is forecasting a rise of 25 points to 7798 at the opening bell.</p>
      <p>Recap: Yesterday’s top stories</p>
      <p>06:53 , Simon Hunt</p>
      <p>Good morning. Here’s a summary of our top stories from yesterday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Financial Conduct Authority has unveiled a fresh set of reforms to London’s listing rules to make it a more attractive destination for a wider range of businesses.</li>
        <li>The boss of HSBC laid out a fresh vision for Silicon Valley Bank UK, which it bought for £1 in March, after it posted a surge in profits.</li>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Global stock markets mostly rose Friday following modestly positive economic data in Europe and the United States, while the yen tumbled after the Bank of Japan maintained its easing policies.</p>
    	<p>European equities ended the session in positive territory after a morning in the red, shrugging off official data confirming that the eurozone economy only just eked out growth in the first three months of the year.</p>	
    	<p>Wall Street followed a similar pattern, getting past early weakness to push higher for a second straight day.</p>	
      <p>"It's a little bit of a relief trade," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that investors remain "a little guarded."</p>
      <p>The week's economic data was "okay," said O'Hare, who noted that earnings from influential technology US companies largely met expectations and in some cases exceeded them.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve's favored measure, the annual personal consumption expenditures price index, eased to 4.2 percent in March from a revised 5.1 percent a month earlier, with a sharp decline recorded in energy prices, according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>
      <p>"Today's PCE data was pretty much as expected but is trending in a good direction for those hoping for inflation to moderate," analysts for Charles Schwab said in a note.</p>
      <p>Most analysts expect the Fed to again lift interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday in response to inflation.</p>
      <p>The United States on Thursday revealed that the economy had slowed more than expected in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>Hard on its heels were Friday's official data showing the eurozone economy expanded just 0.1 percent in the first quarter over the previous three months, as high inflation and interest rates weigh on activity.</p>
      <p>"The very small increase in (eurozone) GDP... means a technical recession has been avoided by a whisker," noted Capital Economics' chief Europe economist Andrew Kenningham.</p>
      <p>"However, the economy has essentially stalled as domestic demand has been hit hard by the energy shock followed by monetary tightening."</p>
      <p>Germany, the EU's biggest economy, saw growth stagnate at zero percent over the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>The yen, meanwhile, fell sharply after the Bank of Japan announced a review of its longstanding monetary easing measures, but said it would maintain them for the time being in the first policy decision under new governor Kazuo Ueda.</p>
      <p>Ueda has previously called the BoJ's current stance "appropriate" and warned of the risk of sudden moves, given global economic uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas, predicted that the central bank could drop its negative interest-rate policy towards the end of 2024 or later, when the global economy is expected to see clear recovery.</p>
      <p>"Because long-term yields are stable globally, the BoJ under Ueda does not have to rush to make policy adjustments," he said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed higher Friday as a pair of closely watched inflation gauges were released. Amazon.com (AMZN) stock sold off after its Q1 earnings, while First Solar (FSLR) plunged on an earnings miss.</p>
    	<p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index matched expectations, rising 0.1% for the month of March, with an annual increase of 4.2%, which also met estimates. The Core PCE price index climbed 0.3% on the month, with an annual increase of 4.6%. The monthly rate matched Wall Street's estimates, while the annual increase came in slightly higher than expected.</p>	
    	<p>Personal income climbed 0.3%, more than the expected 0.2% rise for March. The Federal Reserve will be particularly focused on prices for nonhousing services, which have remained firm as food and energy prices have eased.</p>	
    	<p>Further, the Employment Cost Index, the Fed's preferred measure of wage growth, rose 1.2%, slightly higher than estimates. Seen as a key to services inflation, the hope is it will show that wage growth easing to the 3.5% annual rate that the Fed sees as consistent with its inflation target.</p>
      <h3>Earnings Movers: Amazon, First Solar</h3>
      <p>Amazon stock lost 5% Friday morning after the e-commerce giant reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street targets amid cost-cutting. Management's earnings call commentary raised questions over how long a slowdown in cloud computing growth will persist.</p>
      <p>Other key earnings movers include Chevron (CVX), Cloudflare (NET), First Solar (FSLR), Intel (INTC) and Snap (SNAP).</p>
      <p>Dow Jones energy giant Chevron fell 1% despite beating Q1 earnings and sales targets.</p>
      <p>Cloudflare reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates while revenue roughly met expectations. But Cloudflare stock plunged 25% early Friday on a weak June-quarter and full-year 2023 revenue outlook.</p>
      <p>First Solar badly missed expectations for the first quarter. FSLR stock dived 12% in early trade.</p>
      <p>Chipmaker Intel beat Wall Street's targets for the first quarter but offered a mixed outlook for the second quarter. Intel stock jumped 7.7% in morning trade.</p>
      <p>Finally, Snapchat parent Snap tumbled 18% after missing revenue targets.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) traded down 1% Friday morning. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were mixed after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>InMode (INMD), IBD Leaderboard stock Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Paccar (PCAR) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Nike (NKE) and Visa (V) — are among the top stocks to watch in the now-struggling stock market.</p>
      <p>Nike was featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. InMode was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day. Paccar received an IBD Stock Analysis close up on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, and the S&P 500 edged higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) moved down 0.1%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) traded up 0.1% early Friday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Friday traded down to 3.44%. The 10-year yield is set for solid losses this week, on pace to end a two-week rebound though it is still squarely off its early-April lows.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil prices moved modestly higher Friday morning, but remained down a bit more than 3% for the week. West Texas Intermediate futures are just above $75 a barrel, after pulling back from an April 12 high above $83 a barrel and trading near what has been a mean level of support since December.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally Struggles</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.6% and the S&P 500 advanced 2% Thursday. Both ended two-day skids and found support around their 50-day lines. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.4%, closing at its highest level since April 19. Again, the small-cap Russell 2000 was the laggard, climbing 1.2%, just off its late-March lows.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "Despite Thursday's big gain, the stock market outlook remains in an 'uptrend under pressure.' IBD recommends an exposure level 20% to 40% due to the volatile daily market action. Weak breadth is another concern lately."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column with the stock market now struggling to maintain its uptrend.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Buy And Watch: JPMorgan, Nike, Visa</h3>
      <p>JPMorgan shares rose more than 1.3% Thursday, finding support around their 50-day line. Shares are tracing a cup-with-handle buy point at 141.88, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition. JPM stock fell 0.6% early Friday.</p>
      <p>Nike shares rebounded 1.5% Thursday, holding above their 50-day line and about 2% away from a cup-with-handle's 127.59 buy point. NKE stock moved down 0.4% in early trade.</p>
      <p>Visa shares are still below a 230.15 cup-with-handle buy point; they rose 0.4% Thursday. And V stock dropped around 0.4% in early morning trade.</p>
      <h3>Best Stocks To Buy And Watch: InMode, Paccar</h3>
      <p>InMode finished Thursday just shy of a cup-with-handle's 38.48 buy point, with a 0.1% loss, according to IBD MarketSmith. INMD stock rose 0.7% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: The company makes noninvasive platforms that tighten skin and obliterate fat cells. It's also moving into the women's health realm with gynecological offerings. UBS analyst Danielle Antalffy says InMode provides a lower-cost alternative to traditional plastic surgery.</p>
      <p>Paccar is trying to find support around its 50-day line, as it continues to build a flat base with a 76.82 buy point. An early entry at 75.83 is also in play. PCAR stock was unchanged Friday.</p>
      <p>Backstory: The producer of heavy-duty semi-trucks topped Q1 estimates on Tuesday, reporting a 96% earnings spike. At CES 2022, Paccar exhibited connected and autonomous trucks. The company behind the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates showcased three vehicles.</p>
      <h3>Las Vegas Sands, Lululemon</h3>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Las Vegas Sands remains in the 5% buy range above a 60.40 buy point in a cup with handle amid Thursday's 0.7% gain. The buy zone tops out at 63.42. LVS stock was down 0.4% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: Last week, Las Vegas Sands smashed earnings expectations for the first quarter and signaled a "robust recovery" in China's Macau gaming hub. The casino stock posted earnings of 28 cents per share, up from a loss of 40 cents a year ago. Revenue vaulted nearly 125% to $2.12 billion.</p>
      <p>Lululemon is rebounding from its 371.36 entry in a cup with handle, with a 1.4% rise Thursday. Shares were down 0.3% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: On March 28, Lululemon hiked 2023 guidance after topping earnings and revenue estimates for the holiday fourth quarter, sparking a 12.7% surge on March 29. The yogawear and athleisure apparel retailer's final fourth-quarter results also exceeded its own preliminary announcement, issued in early January.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock bounced 4.2% Thursday, still near its lowest level since late January. In recent weeks, shares triggered the 7%-8% loss rule from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle. And they are trading sharply below their 50-day line. The stock closed Thursday 52% off its 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock threatened to give up Thursday's gains, trading down 1% early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares rallied 2.8% Thursday, closing at their highest level since late August. They remain above a 157.48 buy point and out of the buy range that runs up to 165.35. AAPL stock rose 0.1% early. Apple reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares jumped another 3.2% Thursday, set for weekly gains of nearly 7%. Shares are out of buy range past a flat base's 276.86 buy point. The 5% buy area went up to 290.70. On Friday morning, MSFT stock lost 0.3%.</p>

    	<p>NatWest’s (NWG.L) pre-tax operating profit rose 49% year on year to £1.8bn ($2.2bn) thanks to higher interest rates but tumbling customer deposits disappointed investors and analysts.</p>
    	<p>The group reported an operating profit before tax of £1.8bn for the first three months of the year.</p>	
    	<p>NatWest Group, which includes Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank, also saw its total income surge by more than a third over the period, helped by higher interest rates which makes it more expensive to borrow.</p>	
    	<p>Revenue increased by 29% to £3.9bn — just above analysts’ estimates of £3.8bn.</p>
      <p>Natwest shares slid 5.8% on Friday.</p>
      <p>NatWest Group chief executive Alison Rose said: “Through a period of significant disruption and uncertainty, we continue to stand alongside the people, families and businesses we serve, providing targeted support and growing our lending responsibly.</p>
      <p>“Our disciplined and consistent approach to risk management means that arrears and impairments remain low.</p>
      <p>“By monitoring customer behaviour and looking closely for signs of financial distress, we are able to put in place proactive measures to help those who are struggling right now and those who are worried about the future.”</p>
      <p>NatWest and the other high street lenders have been criticised over how slowly they passed on the benefits of higher rates to customers and earning disproportionate profits by increasing rates on mortgages quicker than rates on savings products.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Rose originally refused to attend a parliamentary hearing with the Treasury select committee but U-turned following public pressure.</p>
      <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “Set against the wider banking turmoil of recent months the solid and dependable, if a little unexciting, performance which NatWest has delivered is just what the doctor ordered for more risk-averse investors.”</p>
      <p>Personal current account balances decreased by £2.6bn and personal savings decreased by £1.8bn in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould, said: “A drop in customer deposits, while nothing like on the scale seen at other crisis-ridden banks, has helped put the wind up investors in NatWest.</p>
      <p>“The gap between the amount NatWest charges for loans compared to what it pays out for deposits, also known as the net interest margin, is also tighter than many had hoped.</p>
      <p>“This runs counter to Barclays’ (BARC.L) own first quarter numbers which showed higher base interest rates were feeding into a strong net interest margin.</p>
      <p>“The disappointing news elsewhere overshadowed NatWest’s better than expected earnings for the first quarter — driven by higher non-interest income and lower impairments on bad debts."</p>
      <p>NatWest chair Howard Davies this week said that "poor risk management" was largely behind recent bank failures and that NatWest remains resilient.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures rose slightly Wednesday morning while Nasdaq futures climbed solidly as Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Boeing headlined big earnings.</p>
          <p>The stock market rally fell sharply Tuesday, with investors wary heading into major earnings Tuesday night and beyond. First Republic Bank (FRC) crashed on deposit flight reviving banking fears. FRC stock kept tumbling Wednesday amid desperate attempts to avoid a collapse.</p>	
          <p>Concerns about China growth, exacerbated by reports of a new Covid wave there, also weighed on stocks, as well as Treasury yields and commodity prices on Tuesday. U.S. government default risks are looming over the horizon.</p>	
          <p>Microsoft stock jumped overnight on strong results and guidance, signaling a move back into a buy zone. Visa (V) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also rose. Google stock turned slightly lower early Wednesday. Enphase Energy (ENPH) dived on mixed results and guidance.</p>
        <p>Boeing (BA) rose solidly Wednesday after reporting mixed results before the open.</p>
        <p>Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders.</p>
        <p>The video embedded in this article discussed Tuesday's market action and analyzed Rambus (RMBS), ServiceNow (NOW) and BJ's Wholesale (BJ).</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
        <p>Dow Jones futures were 0.1% above fair value, with Microsoft stock, Boeing and Visa all Dow Jones components. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures popped 0.85%, well off overnight highs.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to 3.42%.</p>
        <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
        <h3>Microsoft, Google Earnings</h3>
        <p>Microsoft earnings topped fiscal Q3 views comfortably as Azure cloud-computing growth slowed but was perhaps better than feared. The Dow Jones tech titan also guided slightly higher on Q4 revenue.</p>
        <p>MSFT stock leapt 8% early Wednesday. Shares fell 2.25% to 275.42 in Tuesday's regular session. Microsoft closed back below a 276.86 flat-base buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis, but is signaling a move above that level on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In fact, MSFT stock could clear the April 6 high of 292.08. Investors could view the recent action as a handle to a consolidation going back to August or even late 2021.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a U.K. regulator on Wednesday blocked the Microsoft takeover of video game publisher Activision (ATVI) on competition grounds. The $69 billion Microsoft-Activision deal faces FTC opposition as well. ATVI stock dived in premarket trade.</p>
        <p>Google earnings topped views with the internet giant also authorizing up to $70 billion in share buybacks. Google Cloud revenue climbed 28%.</p>
        <p>GOOGL stock fell a fraction in overnight action, reversing from strong Tuesday evening gains. Shares closed down 2% to 103.85 on Tuesday. Google stock has a 106.69 cup-with-handle buy point.</p>
        <p>Microsoft and Google earnings and guidance, along with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) later in the week, have big implications for cloud software, networking, artificial intelligence and many other tech plays. Meta, Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and many cloud software names also rose modestly to solidly overnight.</p>
        <h3>Other Key Earnings</h3>
        <p>Boeing reported a wider-than-expected loss, but a 28% revenue gain topped. The aerospace giant stuck to full-year 737 Max jet delivery targets and plans to boost monthly output soon, despite a recent production halt. BA stock stock rose 4% in premarket trade, signaling a possible test of its 50-day line. Shares are working on a 221.43 flat-base buy point.</p>
        <p>Visa earnings exceeded forecasts, boosted by strong cross-border payments. Shares edged higher in extended action. Visa stock sank 1.4% to 229.59 on Tuesday, holding in range of 230.15 cup-with-handle buy point.</p>
        <p>Chipotle earnings topped views with strong same-store sales growth and profit margins. CMG stock spiked 8% in premarket trade. Shares slipped 0.9% to 1,780, at the edge of a buy zone from a cup base.</p>
        <p>Enphase earnings topped but revenue slightly missed and the solar power inverter maker guided low on Q2 revenue. ENPH stock plunged 17% overnight. Shares fell 1.8% on Tuesday to 220.60, pausing in recent days after retaking the 50-day line. Enphase stock is well below its 200-day line and its December all-time highs. Group leader First Solar (FSLR) reports Thursday.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally suffered significant damage Tuesday, with the underlying action even worse than the major indexes.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1% in Tuesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index lost 1.6%, with FRC stock far and away its worst performer. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, with a heavy exposure to regional banks, plunged 2.4%.</p>
        <p>U.S. crude oil prices slid 2.15% to $77.07 a barrel, a new low for April.</p>
        <p>Copper futures sank 2.7% to the lowest close since Jan. 5. The key industrial metal is down nearly 6% in a five-session losing streak. China demand for metals hasn't recovered as much as hoped, with Covid outbreak fears adding to the downside pressure.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield gapped down 12 basis points to 3.4%. The 2-year Treasury yield tumbled 19 basis points to 3.95%. The odds of another Fed rate hike on May 3 fell modestly on Tuesday but remain high. Markets are growing more confident a May rate hike would be the last one.</p>
        <h3>ETFs</h3>
        <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) gave up 2.7%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) fell 1.2%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slid 3%, with MSFT stock a major holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slumped 3.2%.</p>
        <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) tumbled 3.3% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 3.35%.</p>
        <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) skidded 3% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 2.3%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) gave back 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gave up 1.9% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) sank 1.1%</p>
        <h3>Bank Stocks</h3>
        <p>FRC stock crashed 49% to a record low. First Republic Bank late Monday reported deposits plunged 41%, or $72 billion, in Q1. That's more than $100 billion excluding bank giants depositing $30 billion in March. Deposits were far worse than expected, and much worse than other regional banks that have reported Q1 results.</p>
        <p>First Republic will cut up to 25% of staff and pursue strategic alternatives. It's exploring a sale of up to $100 billion in assets in a desperate effort to avoid an FDIC seizure. That might require extra incentives, perhaps even government guarantees, to find buyers to pay above market value and closer to book value. A solution needs to come soon.</p>
        <p>First Republic's woes could spur fresh deposit flight from other regional banks, even though regulators have sent strong signals that they'll protect all deposits. But bank stocks won't get a bailout. More broadly, regional bank woes could chill lending with recession fears rising. Longer term, regional banks may face significantly higher funding costs, squeezing profitability.</p>
        <p>The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) tumbled 4.2% on Tuesday, hitting their lowest levels since late 2020. FRC stock and PacWest are KRE components.</p>
        <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) retreated 1.7%. XLF, dominated by financial giants including Visa, is well off its March bottom.</p>
        <p>FRC stock sold off more than 10% early Wednesday but off morning lows.</p>
        <p>PacWest Bancorp (PACW), among the hardest hit in March, jumped more than 10% in premarket trade after saying deposits stabilized at the end of March. PACW stock fell 8.9% on Tuesday.</p>
        <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally showed more strains Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite fell below the 21-day line and 12,000 level, undercutting the past few weeks of trading. It's now just above its 50-day line. Notably, the Nasdaq closed below the low of its March 29 follow-through day, a very bearish sign for the market rally.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 undercut its 21-day moving average, not far from its 50-day either. But the S&P 500 is above the low of its March 29 FTD.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones has come down to its 21-day line.</p>
        <p>Damage was worse below the surface. The First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) skidded 2.1%, below the 50-day line. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) slid 1.7%, back below its 50-day line and right at the 200-day.</p>
        <p>Chip stocks are looking weak, with many big recent winners fading or selling off. The SMH ETF is decisively below the 50-day line, erasing all of its late March gains.</p>
        <p>Software is struggling once again. The IGV ETF is also below its 50-day line, with the technical action far worse in many cloud software plays.</p>
        <p>Homebuilders are looking strong, as well as many medicals and some footwear plays, discounters and restaurants such as CMG stock. But many of those are now extended, and even some of these names took hits on Tuesday. Overall leadership has narrowed considerably</p>
        <p>Losers overwhelmingly beat winners on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The market rally could revive over the next several days if earnings are strong and there's a positive reaction to economic data and the Fed meeting.</p>
        <p>Even Nasdaq futures are only recouping a portion of Tuesday's losses. Even if that holds on Wednesday, a rebound wouldn't be that meaningful if it's largely a few megacaps rebounding.</p>
        <p>But it wouldn't take much for the indexes to break decisively lower. Whipsaw action is quite possible, with earnings and other news spurring big gains or losses one day followed by a reversal in the next session.</p>
        <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
        <p>Investors should have been cutting exposure somewhat in recent days, if only because of individual holdings' performance. The recent market pullback has trigged sell signals in some recent buys, while cutting cushions for bigger winners heading into earnings season.</p>
        <p>If the market rally bounces back in the coming days, buying opportunities will return, but perhaps not right away. Many stocks remain near buy points, though most have backed off somewhat in recent days.</p>
        <p>In this scenario, investors could try to add exposure gradually once again. But don't get excited by overnight action or a bounce at the market open.</p>
        <p>But you also have to be ready for the market to keep deteriorating, spurring a big move into cash.</p>
        <p>Staying engaged, flexible and prepared is always important, but especially in the current environment.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>U.S. stocks sank on Tuesday, led by the Nasdaq as tech conglomerates were set to highlight a busy earnings week.</p>
          <p>At the close, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank by 1.58%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by 1.01% or more than 300 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped by 1.98%.</p>	
          <p>Bond yields slipped after the release of fresh housing and consumer confidence data. The yield on the 10-year note slid to 3.38%, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields also declined to 3.98% Tuesday, a further dip from this morning where it stood above 4%.</p>	
          <p>Wall Street is focused on results from big tech, especially given the sector’s outsized influence on broader market gains so far this year. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are scheduled to report after the bell. Alphabet stock is up 20.1% this year while Microsoft has gained more than 17.5%.</p>
        <p>Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) earnings are on deck for later this week.</p>
        <p>Positive earnings surprises have largely been in line with Wall Street expectations, with about 60% of companies beating sales and 70% topping earnings estimates, a bit below their longer-term averages, according to UBS.</p>
        <p>Another focal point for Wall Street will be the energy market, as some of the largest players post earnings at the end of the week, including Exxon (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Valero (VLO), and TotalEnergies SE (TTE).</p>
        <p>WTI crude oil dropped 2% to $77.11 as it was set to mark the lowest settle value since March 31.</p>
        <p>Separately, home prices climbed in February for the first time since June, ending seven consecutive months of price declines, as buyers came back into the market, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. Still, on the housing front, new home sales surged 9.6% in March, topping economists' expectations of a 1.3% drop for the month.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, consumer confidence dipped again in April as worry over a slowing economy and possible recession weighed on American households. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell to 101.3 in April from 104 in March.</p>
        <p>A selloff of First Republic Bank (FRC) shares continues, sinking more than 40% Tuesday after the regional lender reported on Monday that it had a net loss of $72 billion in deposits during the first three months of this year.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are the trending tickers on Yahoo Finance:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP):</strong> The global goods consumer giant raised its full-year profit guidance following its earnings beat in the first three months of this year, which was boosted by resilient demand and higher prices.</li>
          <li><strong>General Electric Company (GE):</strong> The manufacturer posted first-quarter revenue that jumped 25% in their aerospace business.</li>
          <li><strong>General Motors Company (GM):</strong> The automaker reported an upbeat forecast signaling that the industry’s pricing power will run out of steam.</li>
          <li><strong>3M Company (MMM):</strong> The company announced its restructuring plan that would impact 6,000 positions globally.</li>
          <li><strong>United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS):</strong> Delivery giant fell short on revenue as consumer demand pulls back hurting quarterly sales.</li>
          <li><strong>Spotify (SPOT):</strong> Streaming music leader smashed expectations for new subscribers and total listeners in the first quarter.</li>
          <li><strong>McDonald's Corporation (MCD):</strong> The fast-food restaurant reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations as customers remain loyal even as the restaurant raised its prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elsewhere, bitcoin's (BTC-USD) rebound has been notable for the past six months, with its price almost doubling from its lows last year but as Bespoke Investment Group notes that over the past few days, bitcoin has been testing its 50-day moving average, which has held for now at roughly $27,200.</p>

          <p>Dow stocks rallied in the final hours of Monday’s session to close out a mixed trading day, while Nasdaq slipped. Investors are still holding their collective breath as the heart of big tech earnings season approaches.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.2%. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%.</p>	
          <p>“It's been a slow start to the week in the markets as investors have an eye on what's to come with earnings season getting into full flow and major economic releases on the agenda,” Oanda analyst Craig Erlam writes.</p>	
          <p>The global economy has mostly held up against tighter monetary policy so far, leading to expectations of another hike from the Fed and the European Central Bank next month. The prospect of rates staying higher for longer is one reason why the International Monetary Fund is predicting a substantial slowdown this year.</p>
        <p>“A forecast deterioration in the health of the global economy is weighing on minds,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. “With more interest rate rises forecast, and a contraction in lending expected, the worry is that the world’s largest economy will start shrinking.”</p>
        <p>Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley writes that last week’s earnings reports were surprisingly quiet, in terms of how little the U.S. indexes moved.</p>
        <p>“But this week and next may have the potential to push the market out of its congestion phase, one way or the other,” he wrote. “In addition to big tech earnings, over the next 10 days, GDP, the PCE Price Index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge), the monthly jobs report, and a Fed rate decision will all hit the Street.”</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola (ticker: KO) kicked this week’s earnings off with a beat on earnings and revenue for the first quarter, but stock dropped about 0.3%. The bigger test for markets will be results from tech stalwarts like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) after the market closes on Tuesday. They’re followed by Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday.</p>
        <p>“While the macro is clearly not roses and champagne, we believe March earnings season will show better than feared results in the tech space with all investor eyes on the results from Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google this week,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives writes.</p>
        <p>Erlam adds that investors are still trying to figure out the real economic consequences of the banking panic earlier this year that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and how such outcomes could steer the Fed’s ongoing fight with inflation.</p>
        <p>“Earnings season is obviously giving us plenty of food for thought in the interim but the first day of the week isn't typically the most thrilling and we're seeing another example of that today,” Erlam writes.</p>

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned higher Monday ahead of a busy week of earnings results that includes tech titans Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT). C3.ai (AI) dived on an analyst downgrade, while Super Micro Computer (SMCI) plunged after issuing a revenue warning.</p>
          <p>On the economic front, Friday is the big day for data, led by the Commerce Department personal income and outlays report for March, which focuses on the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index.</p>	
          <p>Weekly initial claims for jobless benefits come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Both new claims and continuing claims have been on the rise, so weaker employment reports are likely to follow. Also due for release on Thursday, first-quarter GDP growth is expected to show a 2% rise. New home sales, out Tuesday at 10 a.m., are seen dipping to an annualized pace of 632,000 units.</p>	
        <p>Key earnings reports this week include Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), Halliburton (HAL), McDonald's (MCD), PepsiCo (PEP) and Verizon Communications (VZ).</p>
        <p>On Monday morning, Coca Cola (KO) rallied 1.1% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and sales results.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
        <p>Artificial-intelligence play C3.ai plunged more than 9% Monday after Wolfe Research downgraded the stock from peer perform to underperform, with a 14 price target. Super Micro Computer dived as much as 11% after the company warned that its March-quarter revenue would miss its prior forecast. Super Micro now expects revenue of $1.28 billion, below the $1.47 billion midpoint of its earlier forecast.</p>
        <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) dropped 1.1% Monday morning, while Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft were mixed after today's stock market open.</p>
        <p>Crocs (CROX), DraftKings (DKNG), IBD Leaderboard idea Floor & Decor (FND) and IBD SwingTrader stock Lululemon Athletica (LULU) — as well as Dow Jones stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Nike (NKE) and Visa (V) — are among the top stocks to buy and watch with the ongoing market rally.</p>
        <p>JPMorgan and Lululemon were featured in last week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. Floor & Decor was a recent IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
        <p>After Monday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, and the S&P 500 gained 0.15%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite inched higher in morning action.</p>

          <p>By Lewis Krauskopf, Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas</p>
          <p>April 19 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended virtually unchanged on Wednesday while the Dow dipped as investors digested a mixed bag of corporate earnings, including upbeat reports from medical technology companies, countered by weakness in Netflix shares.</p>	
          <p>The Dow was weighed down by declines in Walt Disney Co and UnitedHealth Group Inc shares following results from rivals in their respective industries.</p>	
          <p>Major equity indexes have been largely stable during the early stages of a first-quarter earnings season that investors expect to show tepid results.</p>
        <p>"Corporate results are being seen as being in large part company-specific news versus market news," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. "If that keeps us relatively calm and unchanged for now, while the sample set of reporters is still quite small, I think that's a positive."</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 79.62 points, or 0.23%, to 33,897.01; the S&P 500 lost 0.35 points, or 0.01%, at 4,154.52; and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.81 points, or 0.03%, at 12,157.23.</p>
        <p>The defensive utilities group gained most among S&P 500 sectors, rising 0.8%.</p>
        <p>The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest point since November 2021 during the session.</p>
        <p>Investors are looking for signs in corporate results that inflation may be driving up costs or hurting consumer spending, amid fears the economy may be on the cusp of a downturn.</p>
        <p>S&P 500 companies overall are expected to post a 4.8% decline in first-quarter earnings from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv IBES.</p>
        <p>"We seem stuck in this range, with those people who think that there is going to be a recession coming and those people who think there is going to be a soft landing," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments.</p>
        <p>Netflix Inc shares slid 3.2% after the video-streaming pioneer offered a lighter-than-expected forecast. Shares of streaming rival Disney slipped 2.2%.</p>
        <p>Tesla Inc shares dropped 2% after the electric-vehicle maker's sixth U.S. price cut this year. Tesla shares slid further in initial after-market trading on Wednesday following the company's quarterly report.</p>
        <p>Shares of Elevance Health Inc fell 5.3% after the insurer's strong quarterly profit failed to ease investor concerns over regulatory hits to the company's government-backed insurance business. UnitedHealth shares dropped 3.6%.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in healthcare, Abbott Laboratories shares jumped 7.8% after the medical device maker said most delayed non-urgent medical procedures had resumed globally three years into the COVID-19 pandemic. Intuitive Surgical shares soared 10.9% after its quarterly revenue and profit topped estimates.</p>
        <p>Shares of Western Alliance Bancorp surged 24.1% after the company posted stronger-than-expected earnings, helping lift the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF 3.9%.</p>
        <p>Regional banks have been in focus after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month prompted concerns about systemic risks.</p>
        <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and one new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 123 new lows.</p>
        <p>About 10 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Richard Chang)</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>The stock market was off session lows at midday Wednesday but still modestly lower as investors keyed on earnings reports from Netflix (NFLX) and other major companies. IBD 50 company Shift4 (FOUR) plunged, hurting that index. Nasdaq 100 stock Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) soared after the company blew away earnings expectations.</p>
          <p>Shortly before noon on Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reduced their losses to 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite had been down about 0.6% earlier as the 12,000 mark seems to hold.</p>	
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%. Small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 shed 0.5%. Volume rose on the NYSE and Nasdaq compared with the same time on Tuesday.</p>	
          <p>The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) underperformed with a 1.5% decline at midday.</p>
        <p>Shift4 did some damage to the IBD 50 as the payment processing firm sold off 12%, piercing the 50-day moving average in heavy volume. FOUR stock was forming an ascending base, but now has a sell signal. Short seller Blue Orca accused the company of accounting practices that inflate its performance.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 3.63%.</p>
        <h3>Netflix, Morgan Stanley Fall On Earnings</h3>
        <p>Netflix stock fell more than 3% in heavy volume, making it one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks. The video streaming service missed Wall Street's Q1 target for new subscribers and its outlook was soft. Earnings fell 18% while sales climbed 4%. Despite the loss, Netflix stock continues to work on a cup-with-handle base.</p>
        <p><strong>Morgan Stanley (MS)</strong>trimmed its loss to about 1% after sinking as much as 3.7%. The investment bank's Q1 2023 profit fell but still beat estimates. Revenue also topped expectations but fell 2% year over year. Investment banking revenue tumbled 24% while trading revenue slid 13%.</p>
        <p>But regional banks — an industry feared to have liquidity problems — shined in Wednesday's stock market on encouraging earnings reports. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1.3% and is finding support around 42.</p>
        <p><strong>Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL)</strong> soared 13% in heavy trading. UBS analyst Brody Preston gave positive comments on a $2 billion increase in deposits so far this quarter, as the report calmed concerns about liquidity and capital.</p>
        <p>It would be the stock's largest increase since Nov. 9, 2020, when it rose 23.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p>
        <p><strong>U.S. Bancorp (USB)</strong> reversed modestly lower, erasing a 2.5% gain, after it reported first-quarter results that topped estimates. Rising interest rates and its acquisition of MUFG Union Bank boosted the quarter for the parent company of U.S. Bank.</p>
        <p><strong>Synchrony Financial (SYF)</strong> trimmed gains to 1% in active trading following a mixed Q1 report for  the consumer financial services firm.</p>
        <p>Dow Jones component Travelers (TRV) climbed 6% after the insurance provider comfortably beat profit expectations. TRV stock regained its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.</p>
        <h3>Nasdaq 100 Stock Soars As Procedures Surge</h3>
        <p>Nasdaq 100 stock Intuitive Surgical roared higher, up 12% as shares gapped above a cup base with a 285.19 buy point. The stock is having its best day since March 24, 2020, when it jumped 17.4%.</p>
        <p>Late Tuesday, the company beat first-quarter profit and sales expectations. Intuitive Surgical saw a  resurgence in robotic surgery procedures during the quarter. Revenue jumped 14% to $1.7 billion, as adjusted earnings rose 9% to $1.23 per share.</p>
        <p>Semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML) beat Wall Street's targets for the first quarter but noted some caution among customers. Shares gapped down nearly 4% but remain in a cup with handle.</p>
        <p>Tesla (TSLA) fell 1.5% ahead of the EV maker's earnings report after today's close.</p>
        <p>Late Tuesday, Tesla trimmed prices in the U.S. for the second time this month. It cut Model Y prices by $3,000, to a starting price of $46,990. Model 3 prices were cut by $2,000, to $39,990. It was Tesla's sixth price cut so far this year and follows cuts in Europe, Singapore and Israel last Friday.</p>
        <p>Tech products distributor CDW (CDW) gapped down nearly 14% in big volume. The company announced Q1 revenue that missed estimates as customers pulled back on spending. It's on pace for its worst day since the height of the pandemic.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market: More Earnings After The Close</h3>
        <p>After the stock market close, Dow component IBM (IBM), chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are among the notable earnings reports.</p>
        <p>There's little on today's economic calendar, but the Fed's Beige Book survey will be released at 2 p.m. ET. Also, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are scheduled to give speeches this evening, according to Econoday.</p>

        <p>By Lewis Krauskopf, Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas</p>
          <p>April 18 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 eked out a slim gain on Tuesday after strength in some big technology stocks countered disappointing quarterly reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs as first-quarter earnings season kicked into gear.</p>
          <p>The Dow and Nasdaq ended with fractional declines on the day.</p>	
          <p>J&J shares fell 2.8% after the healthcare conglomerate cautioned investors over the lingering impact of inflation-driven costs this year. Goldman shares dropped 1.7% after the Wall Street firm's profit fell 19% as dealmaking and bond trading slumped.</p>	
          <p>The early quarterly results from S&P 500 companies come as investors have been bracing for a gloomy reporting season, fearing the economy may be on the cusp of a downturn.</p>
        <p>"What we are seeing here is the calm before the storm as far as earnings go," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network. "The market is just trying to see, do we have some upside here or not, and I think it is really going to come down to earnings over the next couple of weeks."</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 10.55 points, or 0.03%, to 33,976.63, the S&P 500 gained 3.55 points, or 0.09%, to 4,154.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.31 points, or 0.04%, to 12,153.41.</p>
        <p>The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest point since January 2022 during the session.</p>
        <p>The heavyweight technology sector rose 0.4%, helped by a 2.5% increase in shares of Nvidia Corp after HSBC raised its recommendation on the graphics chipmaker to "buy" from "reduce."</p>
        <p>The healthcare sector dropped 0.7%, weighed down by J&J shares.</p>
        <p>S&P 500 company earnings are expected to have declined 4.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data as of Friday. Investors have zeroed in on bank results after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month set off concerns about potential systemic risks.</p>
        <p>"While the big money center banks did very well as a whole, the focus I think is going to be on the regional banks because that is really where the center of the fallout was," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management.</p>
        <p>Shares of Netflix Inc fell in initial after-hours trading on Tuesday following the company's quarterly report.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 is trading near two-month highs as investors await a deluge of earnings and assess the interest rate path ahead of an expected 25 basis point increase at the Federal Reserve's meeting early next month.</p>
        <p>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Reuters on Tuesday the U.S. central bank should continue raising rates on the back of recent data showing persistent inflation. Separately, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the Fed most likely has one more rate hike ahead.</p>
        <p>In other earnings news, Lockheed Martin Corp's shares rose 2.4% after the U.S. weapons maker's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street targets despite parts and labor shortages.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 143 new lows.</p>
        <p>About 9.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones Industrial Average rose off the day's lows and traded nearly flat at 1:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Dow stocks Salesforce (CRM), Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) all rose. JPMorgan (JPM) and Cisco (CSCO) also gained ground while health care stocks fell.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 was also flat in early afternoon trading. However, the index faces resistance at the current level. According to John Lynch, Chief Investment Officer at Comerica, a test of October's lows cannot be ruled out as the risk of an earnings recession looms.</p>	
          <p>The "combination of declining earnings, weakening economic growth, a steadfast Federal Reserve, and a lack of broad participation suggests the equity market is poised to struggle in the weeks and months ahead."</p>	
          <p>FactSet estimates expect an earnings recession, with profits declining 6.0% in the first quarter, greater than the five-year average intra-quarter decline of 2.8%. If met, it would represent a consecutive quarterly decline in corporate profits, resulting in an EPS recession.</p>
        <p><strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> gained after an analyst upgrade.</p>
        <p>Homebuilder stocks Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) rallied ahead of Thursday earnings. Both stocks are in buy zones.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq  fell 0.2% while the small-cap Russell 2000 saw a bigger drop of 0.6%. Travel and leisure stocks Airbnb (ABNB) and Booking (BKNG) rose.</p>
        <p>Volume was lighter on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq compared to the same time Monday.</p>
        <p>Crude oil notched a small gain to trade at $80.93 per barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 1 basis point to 3.58%.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin held steady after clearing a critical level last week.</p>
        <p>The leading crypto coin hit the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022, according to CoinMarketCap. It is a new high for the year after a prolonged crypto winter and black swan events like the FTX crash in November, which pummeled crypto instruments.</p>
        <h3>Stocks Moving Today</h3>
        <p><strong>Bank of America (BAC)</strong> gained in afternoon trading after strong earnings. Net interest income rose 25% as interest rates surged, helping the money-center bank post a strong quarter.</p>
        <p>Weak bond trading and fewer deals undermined Goldman Sachs (GS) quarterly revenue. GS shares were testing the 50-day line after diving over 3%.</p>
        <p><strong>Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)</strong> fell sharply despite posting a strong quarter. The Dow Jones leader raised its full-year earnings outlook to $10.60-$10.70 per share. Sales of its cancer drugs and treatment for Crohn's disease was strong. Investors may have been disappointed by the lack of clarity on baby powder class-action lawsuits.</p>
        <p>HSBC raised its Nvidia (NVDA) price target to 355 and upgraded its rating to buy from reduce. The IBD Leaderboard stock jumped 3%. Shares are extended with no clear base or entry yet.</p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin (LMT) broke out of a flat base after earnings. M/I Homes (MHO) broke out of a cup with handle with a buy point at 63.57. Crocs (CROX) on IBD SwingTrader broke out at an entry of 143.60, with a relative strength line at new highs.</p>
        <h3>AI Race Takes A Turn</h3>
        <p>Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk incorporated a new company in March that will develop artificial-intelligence technologies. Musk helped found OpenAI in 2015 but left it in 2018.</p>

          <p>By Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas</p>
          <p>April 18 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index was little changed on Tuesday as a drop in Goldman Sachs' profit dampened optimism about resilience in the banking sector, with gains in technology stocks helping keep the index afloat.</p>	
          <p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc dropped 2.5% after its quarterly profit fell 19%, hit by sluggish dealmaking and losses from the sale of some loans from its consumer unit Marcus.</p>	
          <p>Bank of America Corp slipped 0.6% in choppy trade even as its first-quarter profit beat analysts' estimate. The wider banking index was down 0.2%.</p>
        <p>Johnson & Johnson fell 2.6% as the healthcare conglomerate's 2023 profit forecast was seen as cautious by several analysts.</p>
        <p>"We expect earnings to really be stressed. It's all kind of this slow motion fall into a recession and that earnings recession is really kind of the next shoe to drop," said Brandon Pizzurro, director of public investments at Guidestone Capital Management.</p>
        <p>Investor expectations were buoyed by strong results from big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co last week in the backdrop of the recent banking turmoil sparked by the collapse of some mid-sized U.S. lenders.</p>
        <p>The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, edged up to 17.15 after hitting an over one-year low earlier.</p>
        <p>The main Wall Street indexes have traded in a tight range since earnings season kicked off but remain close to two-month highs on expectations that the Fed is nearing the end of its monetary tightening cycle.</p>
        <p>Mixed economic data recently has supported bets the Fed will hike interest rates by 25 basis points in May and hit pause before cutting rates in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>St. Louis President James Bullard said that the Fed should continue raising rates as recent data has indicated sticky inflation, while the broader economy seems poised to continue growing, even if slowly.</p>
        <p>At 10:12 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 121.20 points, or 0.36%, at 33,865.98, the S&P 500 was up 1.79 points, or 0.04%, at 4,153.11, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 16.03 points, or 0.13%, at 12,173.75.</p>
        <p>Nvidia Corp jumped 4% after HSBC upgraded the chipmaker's stock to "buy" from "reduce", surprised by its pricing power on artificial intelligence (AI) chips.</p>
        <p>Investors will monitor quarterly earnings from Netflix Inc after market hours.</p>
        <p>Lockheed Martin Corp rose 2.9% after quarterly results of the U.S. weapons maker's surpassed Wall Street targets as simmering geopolitical tensions fueled demand from both domestic and international customers.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, while decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 36 new lows.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Thursday as economic data showed cooling inflation and a loosening labor market, fueling optimism that the Federal Reserve could be nearing the end of its aggressive interest rate hike cycle.</p>
          <p>All three major U.S. stock indexes surged, with interest rate sensitive megacaps providing the most upside muscle and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its biggest one-day percentage jump in nearly a month.</p>	
          <p>Data released before the bell showed a steeper-than-expected cooldown in producer prices and new claims for jobless benefits coming in above consensus. Both signal that the Fed's hawkish barrage of rate hikes, which began over a year ago, is working as intended.</p>	
          <p>The data comes on the heels of Wednesday's muted Consumer Price Index report, which cemented the likelihood of yet another 25 basis point rate hike at the conclusion next month's FOMC policy meeting.</p>
        <p>"Markets rallied today following the lower inflation data this morning, as it's still all about the Fed so it's really all about inflation," said David Carter, investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank in New York.</p>
        <p>"Together with yesterday's muted CPI data, PPI is also suggesting some slowdown in inflation which could mean a quick end to Fed tightening."</p>
        <p>Financial markets are pricing in a roughly one-in-three probability that the central bank will press the pause button and let the Fed funds target rate stand in the 4.75% to 5.00% range, according to CME's FedWatch tool.</p>
        <p>Investor focus now shifts to first-quarter earnings season, which jumps into full swing on Friday when a trio of big banks, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co report.</p>
        <p>"Tomorrow's bank earnings could give insight into the strength of regional banks and future lending activity," Carter added. "It will be interesting to see what banks say tomorrow about future economic growth."</p>
        <p>Analysts expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to come in 5.2% below the year-ago quarter, a stark reversal from the 1.4% year-on-year growth seen at the beginning of the quarter, according to Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 53.96 points, or 1.33%, to end at 4,145.91 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 236.94 points, or 1.99%, to 12,166.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 382.54 points, or 1.14%, to 34,029.04.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines Inc shares dipped following the company's first-quarter profit miss.</p>
        <p>Shares of Harley-Davidson Inc slid after the motorcycle maker announced Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter was leaving the company at the end of April.</p>
        <p>Groupon Inc jumped following the company's appointment of Jiri Ponrt to succeed Damien Schmitz as chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Netflix Inc advanced after Wedbush said the streaming platform's revenue growth of new subscribers could drive up profitability.</p>

          <p>NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday as economic data showed cooling inflation and a loosening labor market, fueling optimism that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its aggressive interest rate hike cycle.</p>
          <p>All three major U.S. stock indexes rose sharply, with interest rate sensitive megacaps including Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com providing the most upside muscle and sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 1.9%, on track for its biggest one-day gain in nearly a month.</p>	
          <p>Data released before the bell showed a steeper-than-expected cooldown in producer prices and new claims for jobless benefits coming in above consensus. Both signal that the Fed's hawkish barrage of rate hikes, which began over a year ago, is working as intended.</p>	
          <p>"Inflation is going to come down faster than the Fed thinks it will, but ironically the banking crisis is bullish for a Fed pause, which is bullish for the market, particularly tech stocks," said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer and Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.</p>
        <p>The data comes on the heels of Wednesday's cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index report, which raised the likelihood of yet another 25 basis point rate hike at the conclusion next month's FOMC policy meeting.</p>
        <p>"The Fed will raise rates one more time in May; one and done," Hatfield added. "They are worried about the banking system, so that should help them get to the right answer.</p>
        <p>"They'll start cutting in 2024."</p>
        <p>Financial markets are pricing in a roughly one-in-three probability that the central bank will press the pause button and let the Fed funds target rate stand in the 4.75% to 5.00% range.</p>
        <p>Investor focus now shifts to first-quarter earnings season, which jumps into full swing on Friday when a trio of big banks, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co report.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to come in 5.2% below the year-ago quarter, a stark reversal from the 1.4% year-on-year growth seen at the beginning of the quarter, according to Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>At 2:05 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 325.52 points, or 0.97%, to 33,972.02; the S&P 500 gained 49.03 points, or 1.20%, at 4,140.98; and the Nasdaq Composite added 225.84 points, or 1.89%, at 12,155.18.</p>
        <p>Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, communication services was up the most, while industrials and materials, outperformers in recent sessions, suffered the steepest percentage declines.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines Inc shares fell 0.9% following the company's first-quarter profit miss.</p>
        <p>Shares of Harley-Davidson Inc slid 3.2% after the motorcycle maker announced Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter was leaving the company at the end of April.</p>
        <p>Groupon Inc jumped 3.4% after the company appointed Jiri Ponrt to succeed Damien Schmitz as chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Netflix Inc rose 4.1% after Wedbush said the streaming platform's revenue growth of new subscribers could drive up profitability.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 121 new lows. (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Chang)</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Delta Air Lines earnings missed views while more economic data is on tap.</p>
          <p>The stock market rally retreated Wednesday as the Federal Reserve saw the banking crisis spurring a recession.</p>	  
          <p>Newly released minutes from the March 21-22 Federal Reserve meeting showed Fed staff forecasting "a mild recession starting later this year." Policymakers expected banking stress to "weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation," Fed minutes showed. Members remained "highly attentive" to inflation risks, however. While several policymakers mulled keeping rates steady, they ultimately voted for a quarter-point rate hike, to a 4.75%-5%.</p>	
          <p>Before the open, the consumer price index came in less than expected, with the CPI inflation rate tumbling a full percentage point to 5%. But core inflation, which excludes food and energy, ticked higher to 5.6%, as expected.</p>
        <p>The odds of a Fed rate hike in early May barely dipped, to around 70%.</p>
        <p>China stocks were hard hit after Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett signaled his concern about geopolitical tensions, notably China and Taiwan. Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), PDD Holdings (PDD) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) all fell hard.</p>
        <p>BABA stock fell Thursday night on a report that SoftBank planned to sell much of its stake in the China e-commerce giant. But shares turned higher before the open.</p>
        <p>TSLA stock hit resistance at a key level, continuing to consolidate ahead of Tesla (TSLA) earnings next week.</p>
        <p>Shopify (SHOP), ServiceNow (NOW), Cloudflare (NET), Crocs (CROX) and Merck (MRK) are all trading near potential entries, with MRK stock getting an analyst upgrade early Thursday.</p>
        <p>ServiceNow and CROX stock are on SwingTrader. NOW stock and Crocs also are on the IBD 50. Shopify was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
        <h3>Delta Earnings</h3>
        <p>Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported Q1 earnings before the open, kicking off results for carriers. Adjusted EPS fell short, even as revenue solidly beat. But the carrier guided higher on Q2 EPS.</p>
        <p>DAL stock rose modestly before the open. Delta shares fell 2.4% Wednesday, below the 200-day line, after American Airlines (AAL) gave first-quarter preliminary results that were slightly above its January guidance, but below analyst consensus. AAL stock tumbled 9.2% to a three-month low Wednesday, but also bounced slightly on Thursday.</p>
        <h3>Drug News</h3>
        <p>Novo Nordisk (NVO) raised its 2023 EPS and sales targets, as an obesity drug sees booming demand. NVO stock, already at record highs, rose modestly in premarket trade.</p>
        <p>Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) tumbled on a report that FDA staff were leaning toward opposing its gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy earlier this year before a top official intervened.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
        <p>Dow Jones futures were steady vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures edged higher and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.15%.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department will release the March producer price index and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p>
        <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally initially opened solidly higher on the CPI inflation report, pulled back, and then wavered until Fed recession fears took hold.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 0.1% in Wednesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index fell 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite slumped 0.85%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 0.7%.</p>
        <p>U.S. crude oil prices rose 2.1% to $83.26 a barrel, the highest close in nearly five months.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell 1 basis point to 3.42% after hitting 3.34% soon after the open. The two-year yield fell 9 basis points to 3.97%. The 3-month T-bill yield nudged down, just 2 basis points to 5.01%.</p>
        <h3>ETFs</h3>
        <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 0.7%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) inched up 0.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dipped 0.2%, with NOW stock a significant component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.8%.</p>
        <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 2.9% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) retreated 2.3%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs, with Shopify a top-10 holding. Cathie Wood's Ark also owns a small BYD stock stake.</p>
        <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) fell 0.8% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) rose 0.4%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 3.1%, with Delta and AAL stock big components. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) dipped 0.1%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) edged up 0.1% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) ended fractionally higher.</p>
        <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dipped 0.2%. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell 1.1%.</p>
        <h3>Buffett Wary Of China Tensions</h3>
        <p>Warren Buffett said Wednesday on CNBC that he thinks China EV giant BYD (BYDDF) is "extraordinary" while Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is a "fabulous enterprise." But that didn't stop Berkshire from substantially cutting its stakes in both companies.</p>
        <p>Buffett made a big bet on TSM in Q3, but then slashed the position by 86% in Q4. He said he "re-evaluated" China-Taiwan tensions, not the business or management.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Berkshire has roughly halved its big, long-term stake in BYD starting in August, with the latest share reduction disclosed earlier this week.</p>
        <p>TSM stock fell 2.7% on Wednesday, trading below the 50-day line. BYD stock sank 3.9%, back below its 50-day.</p>
        <p>But many China internets had bigger losses. BABA tumbled 5.9%, undercutting its 50-day line within a cup-with-handle base.</p>
        <p>JD stock slumped 7.65% to its worst level since its October lows. PDD stock skidded 5.2%, starting to losing sight of its 200-day line. TCEHY stock gave up 5.4%, knifing below its 50-day.</p>
        <p>The Krane CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) slumped 4.5% to 28.62, below its 200-day line. It hit a 52-week high of 36.19 on Jan. 26 after more than doubling from its October low.</p>
        <p>SoftBank plans to sell the bulk of its Alibaba stake, the Financial Times reported late Wednesday. Alibaba fell 4% or more so initially, but is now up slightly early Thursday. Other China stocks looked set to regain some of their losses.</p>
        <h3>Stocks Near Buy Points</h3>
        <p>SHOP stock climbed 1.2% on Wednesday to 45.30, but came well off an intraday high of 48.75. Investors could use 48.36 as an early entry. JMP Securities upgraded Shopify stock to a buy rating on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>NOW stock edged up 0.3% to 471.43, but well off session highs as well. ServiceNow stock now has a handle on its cup base, giving it a 482.43 buy point.</p>
        <p>NET stock popped 3.9% to 63.04. Intraday, shares topped a 63.19 early entry in a consolidation.</p>
        <p>CROX stock fell 1.5% to 126.19. Shares are working on a 143.60 official buy point. But investors could use 130.90 as an early entry, which would clear the bulk of trading going back to Jan. 18.</p>
        <p>MRK stock climbed 1.1% to 113.75 on Wednesday. Shares are near a 115.59 consolidation buy point. The Dow Jones drug giant has been wedging up in the recent days, not creating much of a shakeout. Merck stock rose slightly Thursday as Citigroup upgraded it to a buy, raising the price target to 130 from 105.</p>
        <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
        <p>Tesla stock fell 3.35% to 180.54. reversing lower from near the 50-day moving average. Shares are still within a cup-with-handle base with a 217.75 buy point, according to  MarketSmith analysis. The base formed below the 200-day line, which has drifted down to about 214. Investors may want to use a decisive clearing of the 200-day line as an entry.</p>
        <p>Tesla will cut some Model 3 and Y prices in Hong Kong on April 15, the Hong Kong Economic Times reported Wednesday, including a 14% reduction for the Model 3 Performance variant.</p>
        <p>TSLA stock tumbled 10.8% last week, as Tesla cut EV prices in the U.S. and Australia following record Q1 deliveries that fell short of views.</p>
        <p>Tesla earnings are due April 19, with gross margins in focus.</p>
        <h3>Market Rally Analysis</h3>
        <p>The stock market rally was up and down Wednesday, taking a more-decisive trend lower starting midafternoon. It's not just that Fed staff forecast a recession, it's that markets see policymakers still raising rates, one final time.</p>
        <p>Bearish outside reversals are never a great sign, but the major indexes haven't significantly changed their character — yet.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq, off for a third straight session, fell below the 12,000 level but is still above its 21-day. The tech-heavy index has suffered three distribution days in the past five sessions, something to note.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 briefly topped its early April highs before fading. The Dow Jones reversed from its best levels in nearly two months.</p>
        <p>The Russell 2000 fell back below its 21-day line.</p>
        <p>Some leading stocks made gains. But many others reversed lower from opening gains.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and many growth stocks are close to breaking above key levels. But they're also not far from breaking below important support.</p>
        <h3>What To Do Now</h3>
        <p>This is not a rip-roaring stock market rally. The major indexes have moved sideways over the past couple of months, with big swings in sectors and leaders at various points. So while investors should be taking part, it's not a time to be super aggressive.</p>
        <p>How exposed should you be? If your stocks are working, your exposure might be 40%, 50%, or more depending on your risk tolerance. If you've been shaken out of stocks or had to cut a number of losers, your exposure might be quite less.</p>
        <p>Either way, if and when conditions improve, you can gradually make new buys and add to your exposure. Stay engaged and remain flexible. Have your watchlists ready and your exit strategies in place.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Tesco (TSCO.L) has reported a jump in yearly sales but profits halved in what the grocer called an “incredibly tough year for customers”</p>
          <p>While its sales rose 7.2% to £65.7bn, pre-tax profits dropped from just over £2bn to around £1bn, as shoppers made more trips to the supermarket but bought fewer items.</p>	
          <p>Bosses said the supermarket giant had come under pressure from rising prices as its customers also struggled under soaring inflation.</p>	
          <p>“It’s been an incredibly tough year for many of our customers, and we have been determined to do everything we can to help,” said chief executive Ken Murphy.</p>
        <p>“Our results reflect our continued investment in delivering great value and quality for our customers, whilst at the same time looking after our colleagues.</p>
        <p>“This is despite unprecedented levels of inflation in the prices we have paid our suppliers for their products, and the cost of running our own operations.”</p>
        <p>Sales of food in the UK rose 4.6% in the year, led by the group’s own-label ranges, with sales of its premium Finest range up nearly 7% and its cheapest “Exclusively at Tesco” range up 6%.</p>
        <p>Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said: “Tesco is continuing to cement its position as the UK’s top supermarket.</p>
        <p>“Profits may be down, but that was to be expected from the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis and post-pandemic normalisation in shopping habits.</p>
        <p>“Sales growth, meanwhile, remains robust and Tesco is well placed to benefit from consumers looking to save on their weekly shop through its different initiatives – particularly its Clubcard scheme.</p>
        <p>“While profits are expected to be flat for the year ahead, the continuation of its share buyback scheme and strong execution of its strategy mean Tesco remains in good shape.”</p>
        <p>Shareholders will receive a dividend of 7.05p a share worth £516m in June, with the company also announcing plans for a buyback of its shares worth £750m.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 stock, which has been trading at an eight month high in recent sessions, rose 2.34% to 273.6p as investors also welcomed plans for a further buyback of shares.</p>
        <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “With the current challenges unlikely to abate in the medium term, Tesco is guiding for flat retail profits in the year ahead, being extremely mindful that any lessening of its focus could have an immediate and damaging impact. While the company remains the one to beat in terms of size in the UK, growth is also increasingly hard to come by given the higher base.</p>
        <p>“Indeed, the share price has struggled to make much progress of late. Despite a bounce of 34% over the last six months, the shares remain down by 1% over the last year, as compared to a gain of 3.2% for the wider FTSE100. The three-year performance is rather more respectable, with the shares having added 20% and investor optimism has not dwindled in the face of such aggressive competition. The market consensus of the shares as a strong buy is testament to the esteem in which many investors still hold the stock.”</p>
        <p>AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould added: "Holding on to customers in a cost of living crisis is no joke, even for a company with the scale and purchasing power of Tesco. The company is having to take a hit on profit and margins to keep the tills ringing and customers heading through its doors.</p>
        <p>“This hit is even more acute because Tesco is itself exposed to higher labour and energy costs. Online groceries, which finally started to make a positive contribution during the pandemic will also be heavily impacted by smaller basket sizes as the costs for Tesco of delivering the goods don’t change in proportion to the amount ordered.</p>
        <p>“Tesco seems to be making the calculation that it can absorb some pain now to maintain and even improve its market share, particularly from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl, and emerge in a stronger position once the economic outlook starts to pick up.</p>
        <p>“There is merit to this strategy, particularly at a time when rivals, most notably Morrisons, are really struggling and don’t have Tesco’s financial strength.</p>
        <p>“What Tesco doesn’t want to be drawn into is a race to the bottom on prices which cuts margins right to the bone for a prolonged period. For now, this is the tricky tightrope the supermarket must walk, while rewarding investors for their patience with steady dividends.”</p>
        <p>Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy, said: “These results show Tesco is doing very well during the cost of living crisis, while millions of its customers struggle to put food on the table due to soaring grocery price inflation. It’s clear that Tesco and all the major supermarkets could be working harder to make food more affordable for customers who need help.</p>
        <p>“While we want to see British businesses do well, Tesco has an important role as the UK’s largest supermarket to lead the way on making affordable ranges of healthy, nutritious food more widely available, especially in those areas most in need. The supermarket should also be making pricing clearer, more transparent and more consistent, particularly on Clubcard offers, so consumers can easily compare prices in-store and with other supermarkets.”</p>

          <p>By Stephen Culp</p>
          <p>NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 gained ground on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting revealed several voting members of the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) considered a pause in interest rate hikes amid the regional bank liquidity crisis.</p>	
          <p>The minutes followed a cooler-than-expected inflation report which belied stickier underlying data and cemented the likelihood of another policy rate hike when the Fed convenes next month.</p>	
          <p>All three major U.S. stock indexes were last in positive territory, with cyclical sectors putting the blue-chip Dow in the lead.</p>
        <p>"The Fed is a consensus driven institution," said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. "The market has been very eager to trade that peak policy Fed behavior - the pause and pivot - and the Fed is not communicating that at all."</p>
        <p>The major indexes seesawed as market participants parsed the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>
        <p>That report, on prices urban consumers pay for a basket of goods and services, came in below analysts' expectations, suggesting that the Fed's efforts to tame inflation is taking effect.</p>
        <p>However, core CPI - which strips out volatile food and energy items - hit the consensus bull's eye, and remains well above the Fed's average annual 2% target rate.</p>
        <p>"We saw progress on headline inflation and people started digging in and the initial optimism reversed," Hill added. "The core numbers have seen improvement but they’re well above where they need to be."</p>
        <p>Earlier in the session Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin underscored that reality, remarking that inflation has a long way to go before approaching that target.</p>
        <p>At last glance, financial markets have priced in a 71% likelihood of another 25 basis point interest rate hike at the conclusion of the FOMC's policy meeting next month, and a 29% probability the Fed funds target rate will remain at 4.75% to 5.00%.</p>
        <p>The next market-moving catalyst is likely to be first-quarter earnings season, which kicks off on Friday with results from three big banks - Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.</p>
        <p>Analysts now expect aggregate first-quarter S&P 500 earnings down 5.2% year-on-year, a stark reversal from the 1.4% annual growth seen at the beginning of the quarter.</p>
        <p>At 2:06 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.28 points, or 0.51%, to 33,857.07, the S&P 500 gained 14.01 points, or 0.34%, at 4,122.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.68 points, or 0.05%, at 12,037.56.</p>
        <p>Among the 11 sectors of the S&P 500, industrials were enjoying the largest percentage gain, while consumer staples and consumer discretionary were both in the red.</p>
        <p>American Airlines Group Inc slid 9.1% after it forecast a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit.</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 143 new lows.</p>

        <h3>By Sean Williams</h3>
        <p>A 33% plunge in the Nasdaq Composite is the perfect excuse for opportunistic investors to pounce on discounted growth stocks.</p>
        <p>Although it can be an unpleasant learning experience for new investors, Wall Street provided a reminder last year that stocks can, indeed, go down just as easily as they can rise. Although all three major U.S. stock indexes endured their worst year since 2008, it was the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) that was hit hardest -- a 33% decline.</p>
        <p>But here's the interesting thing about bear market declines in the major stock indexes: They're always a red-carpet opportunity for long-term investors. Despite the Nasdaq Composite undergoing numerous double-digit percentage corrections, a bull market has always, eventually, recouped its losses (and some).</p>
        <p>Since growth stocks took it on the chin over the past 15 months, they're the most logical niche of stocks to bounce back when a new bull market takes shape. What follows are five astonishing growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
        <h3>Vertex Pharmaceuticals</h3>
        <p>The first awe-inspiring growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market decline is biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.09%). Despite its drug portfolio being concentrated in one area of focus, the company's cash flow is well protected.</p>
        <p>Vertex is best known for its role in helping improve the lives of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease characterized by thick mucus production that can obstruct a person's lungs and/or pancreas. Vertex has developed four generations of Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies aimed at improving lung function for patients with the most common CF mutation (F508del). The latest of these treatments, Trikafta, is bringing in more than $8 billion in annual run-rate sales.</p>
        <p>No other drug developer is particularly close to disrupting Vertex in CF. To boot, the company has other areas of focus that may soon be generating recurring revenue. This includes exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) for patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. With a rolling biologics license application for exa-cel in the U.S., Vertex and development partner CRISPR Therapeutics could soon have a new blockbuster on their hands.</p>
        <p>And have I mentioned that Vertex is sitting on a hearty cash pile? Even after outlaying capital to acquire ViaCyte, Vertex's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities grew by $3.3 billion in 2022 to $10.8 billion. This capital puts a healthy floor beneath Vertex's stock and makes its forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 20 appear all the cheaper.</p>
        <h3>PubMatic</h3>
        <p>A second stellar growth stock you'll regret not scooping up on the Nasdaq bear market drop is adtech company PubMatic (PUBM 2.28%). Although it's perfectly normal for ad spending to taper off when the prospects of a recession are climbing, PubMatic finds itself perfectly positioned to take advantage of the shift to digital advertising.</p>
        <p>PubMatic is what's known as a sell-side platform (SSP) in the programmatic ad space. In English, this just means it helps advertisers sell their digital display space using software on its cloud-based platform. One advantage of being an SSP is the amount of consolidation that's occurred in recent years. With fewer competitors, PubMatic has been able to grow its share of the digital ad market.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more importantly, PubMatic is focused on the fastest-growing aspects of the digital ad industry. Whereas the digital ad industry is forecast to grow by 14% on an annualized basis through 2025, PubMatic is generating more than a third of its revenue from omnichannel video programmatic ads, such as connected TV, which are growing at roughly twice the annualized rate as the industry forecast. In short, PubMatic's organic growth rate should easily outpace its peers.</p>
        <p>Another overlooked advantage to PubMatic's operating model is its cloud-based infrastructure. The company chose to build out its own infrastructure rather than rely on a third-party provider. This should prove particularly beneficial to PubMatic's operating margin as its revenue scales.</p>
        <h3>Datadog</h3>
        <p>The third astonishing growth stock just begging to be bought with the Nasdaq mired in a bear market is infrastructure and application monitoring stock Datadog (DDOG -0.42%). While Datadog's premium valuation is a potential headwind during a bear market and possible recession, the company's competitive edge and phenomenal operating performance make it a lot cheaper than most investors realize.</p>
        <p>On a macro basis, Datadog finds itself in the right place following the pandemic. Businesses are increasingly moving their presence online and their data into the cloud. That plays in perfectly with the company's application-monitoring software and real-time unified data platform. According to a forecast from Gartner, the observability market alone is a $62 billion addressable opportunity by 2026.</p>
        <p>But what really makes Datadog tick is its success in gaining big businesses as customers. Though it has an impressive 23,200 total customers, it's the 47% year-over-year growth in the number of clients with $1 million (or more) in annual recurring revenue that's really driving profits at Datadog. Between landing these big fish and seeing existing clients add onto their initial purchase, Datadog has had no trouble sustaining a 25%-plus annual growth rate.</p>
        <p>If you need one more solid reason to pay the premium for Datadog, consider this: Enterprise cloud spending accounted for roughly 8% of global information technology spending in 2021. By 2026, it's estimated to be closer to 20%. Datadog is built to help businesses with their cloud migration, so don't expect its growth rate to slow anytime soon.</p>
        <h3>Cresco Labs</h3>
        <p>A fourth magnificent growth stock you'll regret not adding on the Nasdaq bear market swoon is U.S. marijuana stock Cresco Labs (CRLBF 6.29%). Even though cannabis reform legislation continues to stall in Congress, multi-state operators (MSOs) like Cresco have more than enough catalysts to push into the green.</p>
        <p>As of March 8, 2023, Cresco Labs had 63 operating dispensaries in 10 states. Though 28 of these stores are located in medical marijuana-legal Florida, the company has been spending a lot of its effort pushing into limited-license markets, such as Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. States where regulators limit retail license issuance offer a level playing ground for relatively smaller MSOs like Cresco Labs to build up their brands and grow their following.</p>
        <p>Then again, Cresco Labs may not be "relatively small" for much longer. It's currently in the process of acquiring MSO Columbia Care in an all-share deal. Inclusive of the one dozen facilities being divested to satisfy regulators, the combined company would entail more than 130 operating dispensaries spanning 18 legalized states. Cost synergies should allow this new Cresco to be even more efficient over time.</p>
        <p>Yet the unsung hero of Cresco's operations might be its wholesale segment. While wholesale cannabis margins notably trail retail cannabis, Cresco holds a key advantage when it comes to volume. Thanks to its acquisition of Origin House in January 2020, it holds one of only a few cannabis distribution licenses in California. This allows it to place its proprietary products into hundreds of dispensaries throughout the Golden State.</p>
        <h3>Okta</h3>
        <p>The fifth astonishing growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is cybersecurity company Okta (OKTA 1.74%). In spite of higher-than-expected integration costs following the acquisition of Auth0, Okta looks to be on the path to recurring profits and sustained double-digit sales growth.</p>
        <p>Before getting into company specifics, it's important to recognize that the cybersecurity industry has become something of a necessity service. As businesses move their data into the cloud and develop an online presence, they're becoming evermore reliant on third-party security solutions. Since hackers don't take a day off, neither does demand for cybersecurity solutions.</p>
        <p>Okta specializes in identity verification solutions. The company's platform is cloud-based and relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning to grow more effective over time. Whereas on-premises security solutions have their limitations, Okta can effectively be layered for ongoing monitoring and authorization of users.</p>
        <p>The biggest catalyst moving forward is simply Okta putting its one-time integration costs from buying Auth0 in the rearview mirror. A cleaner income statement in the current fiscal year, coupled with Auth0 breaking down borders and giving Okta an opportunity to expand its revenue channels into Europe, should be a positive for existing shareholders.</p>
        <p>With Okta generating record operating cash flow of $76 million during the fourth quarter and ending the fiscal year (Jan. 31, 2023) with just over $3 billion in subscription backlog, the arrow appears to be pointing higher for long-term investors.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Policy-sensitive Treasury notes fell, sending two-year yields back above 4%, as a solid hiring report bolstered bets for another Federal Reserve rate increase. US stock futures advanced before closing early as the report eased concerns the economy was headed for recession.</p>
        <p>Contracts on the S&P 500 climbed, while the two-year yield jumped 15 basis points to 4.02% after March’s hiring report showed resiliency in the labor market that could enable the Fed to make policy more restrictive. Payroll additions topped 200,000, wage-growth slowed and the unemployment rate dropped.</p>
        <p>“This payrolls info is still indicating that the job market is on solid ground, but the magnitude of the payrolls gain relative to expectations is not significant enough for the Fed to dramatically shift course,” George Cipolloni, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, said. “Wage growth was as expected. I do not see much here that should make the Fed move off of their current path.”</p>
        <p>The cash equity markets are closed in the US for the Good Friday holiday, and futures stopped trading at 9:15 a.m. in New York. Treasuries opened for a shortened session, with the recommended close at noon. European markets were mostly shuttered.</p>
        <p>Swaps trading showed the odds for a quarter percentage point interest-rate increase at the Fed’s May meeting rose to about two in three, up from roughly 50-50 before the data landed. Investors have been aggressively pricing in rate cuts later this year as economic data falls short of estimates, suggesting the American economy is slowing.</p>
        <p>Data Thursday indicated filings for jobless claims rose more than expected, a day after a private reading on hiring came in below estimates. Job openings also contracted more than forecast, adding to worries that the labor market was softening.</p>
        <p>The next major data point for the Fed is a report on consumer prices, due April 12. Officials deliver their policy move on May 3.</p>
        <p>“While this is an employment report not likely to cause alarm, there is still no evidence policy is tight enough to slow demand in a meaningful way, either,” Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial wrote in an email. “There are other things going on in the world, of course, including credit tightening in the aftermath of recent bank failures. It will all go into the mix.”</p>
        <p>The two-year Treasury yield peaked above 5% just before last month’s banking stress and then plunged as worries mounted that tighter lending will constrict growth at the same time the Fed’s aggressive tightening filters through to the real economy.</p>

        <p>The S&P 500 concluded its first losing week in the past four as data Thursday showed filings for jobless claims surpassed estimates last week, a day after a private payrolls report indicated hiring slowed more than forecast.</p>
        <p>US stocks bounced back from early losses on Thursday after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he didn’t think tighter credit conditions stemming from the recent banking turmoil would tip the economy into recession. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund warned that its outlook for global economic growth over the next five years is the weakest in more than three decades, urging nations to avoid economic fragmentation caused by geopolitical tension and take steps to bolster productivity.</p>
        <p>The yen fluctuated after declining Thursday against the dollar for the first time this week. While much of Asia including Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore was closed for holidays, financial markets in Japan and mainland China were open. Japan’s benchmark Topix edged higher, ending a two-day slump, and shares in China and South Korea advanced.</p>
        <p>Money Markets</p>
        <p>The cash pile parked at money-market funds hit a fresh record high in the past week, although inflows slowed from the recent breakneck pace. About $49.1 billion poured into US money-market funds in the week to April 5, bringing total assets to an unprecedented $5.25 trillion, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.</p>
        <p>Money-market funds have been scooping up cash recently. Initially much of that flow was driven by more attractive rates, but concern about the steadiness of some smaller lenders helped turbocharge that within the past month.</p>
        <p>Some of the main moves in markets:</p>
        <p>Stocks</p>
        <ul>
          <li>S&P 500 futures rose 0.2% as of 9:15 a.m. in New York</li>
          <li>Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.1%.</li>
          <li>The Topix gained 0.3%, while the Nikkei 225 added 0.2%</li>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Wednesday amid uncertainty over the outlook for the world economy as reports on job openings and factory orders in the US heightened recession fears.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.45% to 7,668 points during midday trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was flat at 7,339 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) slipped 0.21% to 15,571.</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the red ahead of the opening bell.</p>
        <p>Wall Street sank and oil prices held steady Tuesday as new data showed fresh signs of labour market cooling and declining factory orders from businesses.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.59% to close at 33,402 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.58% to finish at 4,100 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) slipped 0.52% to 12,126.</p>
        <p>On the economic front, vacancies at US employers fell to 9.93 million from 10.5 million, a bigger fall than expected. On the other hand, quits were up and layoffs were down, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Separately, factory orders fell 0.3%, also lower than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Some economists view the slowdown in the number of open job positions as "progress" to reaching the Fed's goal of an equilibrium between supply and demand in the labour market.</p>
        <p>"While the Fed will welcome the softening in the data, officials will put much more stock in Friday's employment report and will continue to raise rates at the coming meetings to ensure further progress is made toward softer labour market conditions and lower inflation," Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.68% to 27,813 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong tumbled 0.66% to 20,274. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) gained ground, rising 0.49% to 3,312 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, the FTSE was being aided the banking sector after Barclays (BARC.L) rose 1.79% and Lloyds (LLOY.L) lifted 1.20%.</p>
        <p>The index was led by the United Utilities Group (UU.L), up 2.98%.</p>
        <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: "Markets are drifting as investor thoughts start to turn towards the scale of severity, as the likelihood of a recession later in the year in the US increases.</p>
        <p>"Further evidence of a slowing economy came in the form of releases showing factory orders which dropped for a second month and, in particular, as job openings fell to the lowest level in almost two years. The resilience of the labour market to date has kept the Federal Reserve on high alert in its battle against inflation, and most recent data has tended to suggest that the interest rate hiking policy is now taking a measured effect on crimping growth."</p>
        <p>Hunter added that as traders begin to rein in any new positions ahead of the long Easter weekend, markets were finding little reason to make any progress.</p>
        <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) was down against the dollar, trading around $1.24, after rallying the previous session. Investors are waiting on the latest UK PMI data, which can have a knock down effect on the sterling.</p>
        <p>The same against the euro, with sterling (GBPEUR=X) hovering around €1.14.</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) stopped its climb was trading at around $85/barrel, after rebounding demand in the US after data revealed that US crude stockpiles decreased by more than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Supply side concerns are also pushing prices higher, driven by the recent output cut decision by OPEC and other oil-producing countries.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished higher this Friday as the UK economy grew by more than first thought in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.29% to close at 7,642 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1% to 7,336 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) gained 0.83% to 15,652.</p>
        <h3>UK avoids recession</h3>
        <p>Revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed that the UK economy avoided recession in the second half of last year, posting 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The economy shrank in the third quarter of last year, but Friday’s data confirmed that the economy did not shrink for two successive quarters, which is the technical definition of recession.</p>
        <p>Gabriella Dickens at Pantheon Macroeconomics noted the UK is still is the only G7 economy in which GDP has not yet recovered to the same level as quarter four of 2019, before the pandemic struck.</p>
        <p>“Indeed, GDP still was 0.6% lower than it was three years ago in the UK, whereas it was 5.1% higher in the US, 2.9% higher in Canada, 0.8% in Japan, 1.2% in France, 1.9% in Italy and just back in line in Germany,” she said.</p>
        <p>The dominant services sector grew by 0.1%, boosted by a jump of nearly 11% for travel agents.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing was up by 0.5%, driven by the pharmaceutical sector, and construction grew 1.3%.</p>
        <p>ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy performed a little more strongly in the latter half of last year than previously estimated, with later data showing telecommunications, construction and manufacturing all faring better than initially thought in the latest quarter."</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Wall Street pushed higher on Friday as the final trading day of an eventful first quarter got underway.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.73% to 33,098 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.77% to 4,082 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 0.99% to 12,132.</p>
        <p>Stock futures perked up on Friday morning after inflation data showed further cooling in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.</p>
        <p>In February, "core" PCE, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy, rose 0.3% over the prior month and 4.6% over last year, with the annual increase coming in below Wall Street expectations for a 4.7% rise.</p>
        <p>A slowdown in inflation could ease pressure the Federal Reserve feels to continue with its rate-hiking campaign, which Fed officials earlier this week suggested will likely continue this spring given price increases that remain too high and a bank crisis that has shown signs of ebbing.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.93% to 28,041 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong rose 0.74% to 20,459. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, rising 0.36% to 3,272 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado Group (OCDO.L) rose 2.27% after it said had "comprehensively won" the patent infringement suit brought by AutoStore (AUTO.OL).</p>
        <p>Miner Rio Tinto (RIO.L) rose 0.86% after signing a joint venture with Canada's First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) to develop the La Granja copper project in Peru.</p>
        <p>Rolls-Royce (RR.L) saw shares jump after it announced a new chief financial officer (CFO). The new boss of Rolls-Royce hired Helen McCabe from his alma mater BP (BP.L) as CFO. However, the stock was trading at a loss in afternoon trading and closed 0.69% lower.</p>
        <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) was flat against the dollar, trading around $1.23.</p>
        <p>It was also weaker against the euro, with sterling (GBPEUR=X) hovering around €1.13.</p>
        <p>Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, said: “The pound is set to be the best-performing currency of the first quarter of 2023, having gained 2.5% against the dollar”.</p>
        <p>“Along with the improvement in the economic outlook, sterling is definitely drawing benefits from the market’s conviction that the Bank of England will need to continue raising rates.”</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $79 per barrel, as traders await the release of the personal consumption expenditures index on Friday, an indicator of US inflation that is certain to move oil prices.</p>
        <p>Fear of supply disruptions continues to dominate the global oil market, so Brent is set to end the week higher despite the volatility.</p>

        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were higher on Tuesday after the banking industry turmoil of the past few weeks but the rally seemed to be losing steam</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was near parity at 7,476 points during midday trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was also muted at 7,1080 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) was flat at 15,138.</p>
        <h3>Bank of England</h3>
        <p>Bank of England (BoE) governor Andrew Bailey said a wave of early retirements could force up inflation, leading to higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the London School of Economics on Monday evening, Bailey said that a sharp decline in the number of people in the workforce was “part of the reason why we have had to raise Bank Rate by as much as we have”.</p>
        <p>That trend, he warned, will drive up prices and mean borrowing costs may need to be higher.</p>
        <p>He said: “We should expect this to put upward pressure on inflation in a way that would call for a higher level of interest rates to dampen demand.”</p>
        <p>Bailey said the rise in inactivity of people aged 50 to 64 was “particularly striking”.</p>
        <p>Bailey said the BoE had not already decided that interest rates needed to increase further but noted that inflation of 10.4% in February was “much too high”. He stressed that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would assess the “emerging evidence” before opting to lift rates again.</p>
        <p>Last week, the BoE raised the Bank rate toto 4.25% — its highest level since 2008.</p>
        <p>The European Central Bank, US Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank have also all raised interest rates this month.</p>
        <p>Markets are also taking note of Bailey speaking at the Treasury Select committee about the Silicon Valley UK arm's collapse.</p>
        <p>The governor of the Bank of England has said that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the quickest seen since Barings Bank failed in 1995.</p>
        <p>Andrew Bailey told MPs that the UK subsidiary of the Californian lender experienced a 30% run on its deposits in a single day as panic spread through markets and savers.</p>
        <p>Despite the run, Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm as able to meet those requests, which made its sale process to HSBC (HSBA.L) easier.</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the green ahead of the opening bell.</p>
        <p>Wall Street finished mixed on Monday, as bank stocks moved upward after North Carolina-based First Citizens (FCNCA) bank agreed to buy most of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.60% to close at 32,432 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.16% to finish at 3,977 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) lost 0.47% to 11,768.</p>
        <p>Banks will dominate the headlines again this week with the earnings and economic calendars in sight. The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on bank failures on Tuesday, with the witness list including FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg, Federal Reserve vice chairman Michael Barr, and Treasury undersecretary Nellie Liang.</p>
        <p>Barr wrote in a statement ahead of the hearing on Monday that the failure of SVB reeked of "mismanagement."</p>
        <p>"To begin, SVB's failure is a textbook case of mismanagement. The bank had a concentrated business model, serving the technology and venture capital sector," Barr's testimony reads.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) rose 0.15% to 27,518 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong climbed 1.10% to 19,782. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) lost ground, falling 0.18% to 3,245 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, Ocado Group (OCDO.L) lost 4.39% after Ocado Retail, despite its joint venture with Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) reporting a rise in revenue.</p>
        <p>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "A relief ripple is helping stocks make some gains amid hopes that the volatility, which has wracked the banking sector, has eased off.</p>
        <p>“Right now, worries about the impact of banking turmoil are taking a back seat and the Bank of England is intent on steering consumer prices lower. Governor Andrew Bailey stressed in his speech in London last night that interest rates may have to move higher if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressure.”</p>
        <p>Spirits maker Diageo (DGE.L) has appointed its first female chief executive after announcing the retirement of Sir Ivan Menezes after a decade in the top job.</p>
        <p>Debra Crew will step up from her current position as chief operating officer and lead the FTSE 100-listed business from 1 July.</p>
        <p>Across the wider FTSE 250 index (^FTMC), gambling company William Hill (888.L) has been hit by a record £19.2m ($23.6m) fine by the UK gambling regulator.</p>
        <p>Three gambling businesses owned by the company will pay the sum for "widespread and alarming" social responsibility and anti-money laundering failures, the Gambling Commission said.</p>
        <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) gained ground against the dollar at over $1.23. Sterling (GBPEUR=X) rose nearly 0.15% against the euro, trading near €1.14.</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) climbed and was trading at around $78 per barrel, with markets focused on developments in the banking crisis and indications of strengthening demand in China.</p>
        <p>"Though risks remain in the banking system amid the recent event, dip-buys in crude oil could be the prevailing trend in the near term," said Tina Teng, analyst at CMC Markets.</p>

        <p>The Nasdaq Composite losing a third of its value is the perfect excuse for opportunistic investors to pounce on high-quality growth stocks.</p>
        <p>As much as we'd like the stock market to move higher and never falter, it's important to recognize that corrections, crashes, and bear markets are a normal part of the long-term investing cycle. Last year, all three of the major U.S. stock indexes plunged into a bear market, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) getting hit hardest -- a 33% decline when the finish line was crossed.</p>
        <p>While bear markets can be unpleasant in the short run and tug on investors' heartstrings, they're also, historically, the ideal time for patient investors to pounce. Even though we can't consistently forecast when a bear market will begin, how long it'll last, or how steep the decline will be, we do know that all previous bear markets have eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally. In other words, bear market volatility is a red-carpet invitation for opportunistic investors.</p>
        <p>With growth stocks taking it on the chin, they're a logical place for long-term investors to look for bargains. What follows are five jaw-dropping growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
        <h3>CrowdStrike Holdings</h3>
        <p>The first awe-inspiring growth stock that's ripe for the picking during the Nasdaq bear market decline is end-user cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -2.23%). Though recessionary fears have weighed on CrowdStrike in the short run, it's well positioned with clear-cut competitive advantages over the long term.</p>
        <p>On a macro basis, investors should be aware that cybersecurity solutions have evolved into basic necessity services. Hackers and robots don't take vacation days just because the U.S. economy hits a speed bump. Businesses of all sizes with an online and/or cloud-based presence are increasingly relying on third-party providers like CrowdStrike to protect their sensitive data.</p>
        <p>The engine that powers CrowdStrike's incredible growth is Falcon, the company's cloud-native platform that's reliant on artificial intelligence (AI). Falcon is overseeing trillions of weekly events, which is helping it become smarter at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time. Despite CrowdStrike's services being costlier than its peers', the company's gross retention rate of 98% speaks volumes about Falcon's efficacy.</p>
        <p>Although CrowdStrike hasn't had any trouble gaining new subscribers, the most intriguing aspect of its ascension is the add-on sales from existing clients. Six years ago, a single-digit percentage of its 450 clients had purchased four or more cloud-module subscriptions. Today, 62% of its more than 23,000 subs have purchased five or more cloud-module subscriptions. These add-on sales are the key reason CrowdStrike's subscription gross margin is near 80%.</p>
        <h3>Fiverr International</h3>
        <p>A second stellar growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (FVRR -0.38%). Despite near-term worries of a possible U.S. recession weakening the labor market, Fiverr has three key catalysts it brings to the table.</p>
        <p>To start with, the labor market has been permanently shifted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some people have returned to the office, more are choosing to work remotely than ever before. This means Fiverr's freelancer marketplace is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this structural change in the workforce.</p>
        <p>Another reason Fiverr stands out is the way its freelancers market their work. Whereas pricing tasks on an hourly basis is commonplace at competing online-service marketplaces, Fiverr freelancers price their work as a package. The price transparency of Fiverr's platform is helping to push both spend per buyer and the aggregate number of buyers higher.</p>
        <p>The third differentiating factor is Fiverr's take-rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform that it gets to keep. Most competing freelancer marketplaces keep around 15% of the revenue tied to negotiated deals. Fiverr's take-rate continues to climb and hit 30.2% during the fourth quarter.  Fiverr isn't scaring away buyers or freelancers, and a 30%-plus take-rate shows it'll be substantially more profitable than its peers.</p>
        <h3>Intuitive Surgical</h3>
        <p>The third jaw-dropping growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying on the Nasdaq bear market plunge is robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 4.89%). Though COVID-19 has caused some optional surgical procedures to be pushed to a later date, Intuitive Surgical's dominance of the robotic-assisted surgical landscape, along with its operating model, sets this company up for long-term success.</p>
        <p>As of the end of 2022, Intuitive Surgical had installed 7,544 of its da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals and surgical centers worldwide.  While this might sound like a pedestrian figure, it's far more than its competitors. For a two-decade stretch, da Vinci was one of the only soft-tissue assistive surgical systems available.</p>
        <p>What's more, it takes a considerable amount of time to train surgeons to use da Vinci, and it's pricey to purchase these systems -- $500,000 to $2,500,000 per system. The tangible expense and opportunity cost associated with purchasing a da Vinci surgical system makes it highly unlikely that hospitals or surgical centers will switch to a competing device.</p>
        <p>However, the real lure is Intuitive Surgical's razor-and-blades operating model. The company's da Vinci operating system may be pricey, but it's intricate to build and generates only mediocre margins. But once Intuitive has clients locked into its surgical system, it generates copious amounts of high-margin revenue by selling instruments with each procedure and servicing its systems. As time passes, these higher-margin sales channels are becoming a larger percentage of total revenue.</p>
        <h3>Fastly</h3>
        <p>A fourth marvelous growth stock you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq bear market swoon is edge computing company Fastly (FSLY 0.56%). In spite of ongoing losses, new leadership appears to have Fastly on the fast track to sustained double-digit sales growth and eventual profits.</p>
        <p>Fastly is best known for its work as a content-delivery network. It's tasked with getting data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible. Both the rise of the metaverse and the hybrid work environment in the wake of the pandemic are catalysts that can increase the amount of data traversing Fastly's network. Since this is a usage-based network, more data movement equates to more revenue for Fastly.</p>
        <p>Although its growth rate has slowed a bit, the vast majority of Fastly's key performance metrics remain rock solid. Its total customer count has grown by 500 over a seven-quarter stretch (21 months, ended Dec. 31, 2022), with average enterprise customer spend (over the last 12 months) increasing by 11% to $782 over that same span. More importantly, Fastly's dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) is climbing, once again, and hit 123% during the fourth quarter. A DBNER of 123% implies that existing clients spent 23% more during the fourth quarter than they did in the comparable quarter last year.</p>
        <p>Lastly, new CEO Todd Nightingale should inspire confidence in shareholders. Nightingale was hired to tighten the belt at money-losing Fastly, further innovation, and keep the customer count needle moving in the right direction.  Nightingale is, thus far, firing on all cylinders in his young tenure.</p>
        <h3>Baidu</h3>
        <p>The fifth jaw-dropping growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is China's leading internet search provider Baidu (BIDU 3.55%). Though multiple headwinds have held Baidu back for the past three years, many of these hurdles have now been lifted.</p>
        <p>For example, China's zero-COVID mitigation strategy resulted in unpredictable and stringent lockdowns that crippled supply chains for most sectors and industries. With China removing its stringent COVID-19 restrictions, the country's economy is free to thrive once again. Though it could take a few quarters for China's residents to build up immunity to COVID-19, moving beyond the zero-COVID strategy will benefit the country and Baidu.</p>
        <p>What makes Baidu such a phenomenal stock to buy is its dominance of the Chinese internet search space. As of February, it accounted for approximately 56% of all search share in its home market. This makes it the go-to choice for advertisers wanting to target their message(s) and logically gives the company strong ad-pricing power.</p>
        <p>But don't overlook AI as a major future growth driver for Baidu. In addition to the company's recently released AI-powered chatbot, known as Ernie Bot, Baidu AI cloud services and AI-based intelligent driving solutions are delivering double-digit sales growth in the company's nonmarketing sales channel. </p>
        <p>With economic activity in China ramping back up, Baidu stock remains reasonably cheap at 13 times Wall Street's forward-year consensus earnings.</p>

        <p>The Dow Jones dropped 300 points Friday on renewed banking fears. Deutsche Bank dived 10% as the bank's credit default swaps surged.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dropped 300 points Friday on renewed banking fears. U.S. shares of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) plunged more than 10% after concerned investors drove the bank's credit default swaps, which insure against bond failure, to a four-year high. The panic sent investors fleeing into bonds, driving yields lower. Meanwhile, energy stocks crowded the bottom of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 as oil prices swooned.</p>
        <p>Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 1.4% while Citigroup (C) declined 1.8%. And Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 1.7%. The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) dropped 2.1%, with First Republic Bank (FRC) down more than 4%. (For our latest coverage of the market's action, go to our Stock Market Today page.)</p>
        <p>On the economic front, February durable goods orders from the Commerce Department fell 1% for the month. Wall Street saw durable goods orders rising 1.5% for the month vs. January's 4.5% drop. Further, the S&P Global's preliminary Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing and Services Indexes for March came out.</p>
        <p>The manufacturing index posted a better-than-expected 49.3 reading vs. the 47.2 estimates, while the services index measured 53.8, higher than the 50.3 estimate.</p>
        <p>Finally, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is scheduled to speak around the market open Friday.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
        <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) declined 1.7% Friday, following a modest recall in China and after Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management dumped $26.8 million worth of Tesla shares on Thursday. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were lower after today's stock market open.</p>
        <p>Align Technology (ALGN), IBD SwingTrader stock Meta Platforms (META) and IBD Leaderboard Palo Alto Networks (PANW) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Nike and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the top stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market correction.</p>
        <p>Palo Alto is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Microsoft is featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. And Meta is an IBD SwingTrader stock. Palo Alto, Align, Microsoft and Meta were all recent IBD Stock Of The Day subjects.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
        <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which does not track oil or financial stocks, dropped 0.3% in morning action.</p>
        <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.8% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) moved down 0.7% early Friday.</p>
        <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Thursday slipped to 3.4%, falling sharply for a second-straight session. The 10-year yield is near its lowest level since early February. On Friday, the 10-year continued lower, falling to 3.29%.</p>
        <p>U.S. oil prices shifted sharply lower, as West Texas Intermediate traded down 3.6% to just above $67 a barrel. WTI futures are defending a mild gain for the week, after touching their lowest level since November 2021 on Monday.</p>
        <h3>Stock Market Correction</h3>
        <p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rallied as much as 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively, before closing with modest gains of 0.2% and 0.3%. Both briefly turned lower in afternoon trade before a late-day bounce. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shrank an early 2.5% gain down to 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was a laggard, reversing 0.4% lower.</p>
        <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "The stock market ended higher but well off session highs Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen established that the U.S. government is ready to take 'additional action if warranted' to stabilize the banking sector."</p>
        <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column amid the ongoing stock market correction.</p>
        <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Nike, Salesforce</h3>
        <p>Since bottoming on Oct. 3, Nike shares have rallied as much as 59% to their recent high at 131.31. Now the stock is consolidating within a flat base that offers a 131.41 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition.</p>
        <p>Amid Thursday's 1.2% gain, the stock is again consolidating back below its 50-day moving average, a key benchmark. NKE stock moved down 0.7% early Friday.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Dow Jones leader Salesforce showed big upside strength after strong fourth-quarter results. The stock is now above a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry after recent big gains. Still, the market is in a correction, so investors should avoid new purchases until the market environment improves. CRM stock fell 0.4% early Friday.</p>
        <h3>Top Stocks To Watch: Align, Meta, Palo Alto</h3>
        <p>Align Technology continues to trace a consolidation that has multiple buy points: a 357.10 early entry and a conventional entry at 368.97. Shares fell 0.7% Friday morning.</p>
        <p>Backstory: The company makes clear teeth-straightening systems called Invisalign. UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo says investors recently regained confidence in Align stock, which has surged 50% this year. December-ended quarter results from Align and its competitors, management commentary, U.S. economic data and a recent uptick in demand for Invisalign cases support this view, he said in a note to clients.</p>
        <p>Backstory: Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over macroeconomic concerns, recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.</p>
        <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Palo Alto Networks reclaimed its 192.94 buy point out of a cup with handle during Thursday's 1.6% move higher. The buy area runs up to 202.59. PANW stock traded down 0.6% Friday.</p>
        <p>Backstory: Through acquisitions, Palo Alto Networks has expanded into endpoint security and vulnerability management. Endpoint tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.</p>
        <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
        <p>Tesla stock rose 0.6% Thursday, bouncing a bit after Wednesday's 3.25% skid. Shares continue to rebound from their 50-day moving average. Shares closed Thursday around 50% off their 52-week high.</p>
        <p>TSLA stock lost 1.7% Friday morning, as it threatened to give up Thursday's gains.</p>
        <p><strong>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</strong></p>
        <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares climbed 0.7% Thursday, recovering a large part of Wednesday's decline. AAPL stock fell 0.4% Friday.</p>
        <p>Microsoft shares are again trying to break out above a flat base's 276.86 buy point with a 2% gain Thursday. MSFT stock lost 0.6% early Friday.</p>
        <p>Microsoft shares surged last week after the company announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications. That follows the company's investments in AI startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzy ChatGPT application.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished mixed this Thursday as the Bank of England raised interest rates to 4.25%.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 0.69% to close at 7,515 points , while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.22% to 7,146 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.14% to 15,237.</p>
        <h3>Bank of England's interest rate hike</h3>
        <p>The Bank of England (BoE) has raised the UK interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 4.25% to combat double-digit inflation.</p>
        <p>This is the 11th time in a row in less than 18 months that the central bank has increased rates, making borrowing costs higher despite the cost of living crisis that has hit UK households.</p>
        <p>It lifts UK interest rates to their highest since October 2008, early in the financial crisis, when Bank Rate was 4.5%.</p>
        <p>Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: “The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee was right to raise interest rates by 25bps at its meeting today. It is possible that recent concerns in the global banking sector will serve to tighten credit conditions, but that is not guaranteed. As with the ECB last week and Fed last night, the Bank of England acted on the information it had today which is that the economy is still resilient, inflation is uncomfortably high and broadening, and wage growth is at a level that is inconsistent with a 2% inflation target.</p>
        <p>“We are concerned that the Bank will find itself outside of the central bank herd in the second half of the year. This is because the persistence of inflation appears more worrying in the UK than elsewhere, reflecting the fact that the combination of Brexit, the pandemic and an energy crisis appears to have done more lasting damage to the supply side of the economy.</p>
        <p>Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist, BlackRock Investment Institute, added: “The Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.25%, in line with our expectations – recent upside surprises in inflation show that we’re yet to see the back of the problem. The increase follows the Federal Reserve and ECB rate rises in recent days, and shows why we’re in a new regime; central banks will not ride to the rescue with rate cuts at the first sign of growth concerns, as we’ve been used to for a generation. Financial stability (stabilising the system given banking concerns, or in the UK’s case last year, the gilt yield spike) and monetary policy actions (dealing with inflation) are distinct.</p>
        <h3>US and Asia</h3>
        <p>Wall Street opened higher Thursday after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled its rate hiking campaign may be nearing an end amid concerns about stability in the global banking system.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 1.16% to 32,402 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 1.36% to 3,990 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 2% to 11,902.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate 0.25% to a 4.75%-5% target range, citing some additional policy firming may be appropriate. Additionally, the Fed said it would continue the same pace of reducing treasury and mortgage-backed security holdings.</p>
        <p>"On net, we think the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) episode and the fallout for the broader regional banking sector will work to slow credit, economic activity, and eventually inflation, resulting in the Fed needing to do less of the heavy lifting to tighten financial conditions," Tiffany Wilding, PIMCO North American economist, wrote in a statement following Powell's press conference.</p>
        <p>Although the Fed did lift US interest rates by a quarter-point, it also dropped its regular warning that “ongoing increases” in Fed Funds rate would be needed.</p>
        <p>“In other words, the Fed has toned down its statement to give it flexibility to pause the interest rate hiking cycle in May depending on incoming economic data,” saidMatthew Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com and City Index.</p>
        <p>Powell also moved to calm banking sector fears in the wake insisting that depositor funds were "safe" in the US banking system.</p>
        <p>The Fed chair said the measures taken in response to the failures, including a guarantee for all deposits held at the two lenders and a new Fed lending facility, "demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe".</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 0.17% to 27,419 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 2.05% to 19,993. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, rising 0.64% to 3,286 points.</p>
        <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
        <p>Back in London, the blue chip was in the red as banks lost as much as 1.1% after two straight days of gains.</p>
        <p>Schroders (SDR.L) led the losses, down 3.52%, with HSBC (HSBA.L) tumbling 2.35%, and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) falling by 2.70%.</p>
        <p>Informa (INF.L) dropped 2.25% after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the events organizer's stock to "equal-weight" from "overweight".</p>
        <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) touched its highest level since the start of February this morning, as the City was right to anticipate another rise in UK interest rates.</p>
        <p>The pound reached $1.2325, up 0.5%, as the dollar slipped following last night’s Federal Reserve decision.</p>
        <h3>Oil markets</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) bounced back and was trading at around $76/barrel amid optimism around China's demand.</p>

        <h3>In this article</h3>
        <p>Britain’s FTSE 100 plunged by nearly 2 per cent in early morning trading on Monday despite UBS’s £2.7 billion rescue deal to save troubled lender Credit Suisse.</p>
        <p>The takeover, announced on Sunday night, failed to convince spooked investors concerned about another meltdown in the global banking system, with 129 points shaved off the value of the 100 biggest firms listed in the UK.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 250 was also down 1 per cent, with banking stocks across the two indexes slumping by 5.3 per cent.</p>
        <p>By 2pm in London, the FTSE 100 was around 0.6 per cent higher for the session, with early session gains seen also on the Dow Jones and S&P 500 on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, market worries continued to particularly hit other banking stocks, which led the fallers in London and Europe’s other key markets.</p>
        <p>The recent collapse of US-headquartered Silicon Valley Bank has continued to send shockwaves through the banking sector, bringing back grim memories of the 2008 financial crash which had major implications for economies across the globe.</p>
        <p>Regulators in Washington - and in London, where SVB had a UK division - stepped in to guarantee customer deposits in the failed tech lender but the moves have so far failed to calm market jitters.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse, founded in 1856 and which had managed more than £1 trillion in assets, has had troubles for years but appears to have been tipped over the age by SVB’s collapse.</p>
        <p>It was hoped that the sale of the Swiss bank - the country’s second-biggest lender and viewed by some analysts as ‘too important to fail’ - would calm anxieties in the markets but there was no evidence of that on Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Markets in Asia were struggling earlier in the morning, with shares in Hong Kong falling by more than 3 per cent as the banking sector took a battering.</p>
        <p>“With Credit Suisse shareholders and some bondholders taking a huge hit, banks in Asia have taken a hit on similar concerns about (some of their) bond-holding values,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</p>
        <p>“While the weekend deal still presents the Swiss National Bank and Swiss Government with untold headaches, with the size of the newly merged bank set to dwarf the size of the Swiss economy.</p>
        <p>“The phrase too big to fail really does spring to mind here, and this morning’s weakness in Asia markets serves to reinforce concerns about these types of writedowns and any spillover effects on the rest of the banking sector.”</p>
        <p>The Credit Suisse deal was announced on Sunday evening, as UBS agreed to pay around £2.7 billion for its former rival. The deal was brokered by the same Swiss regulators which had on Wednesday said they would lend up to £45 billion to Credit Suisse to keep it afloat.</p>
        <p>“Having come off the worst week for European equity markets this year, volatility looks set to continue this week now that the fate of Credit Suisse appears to have finally been sealed,” Mr Hewson said.</p>
        <p>UBS’s merger was welcomed internationally, with the US Federal Reserve and Treasury saying Switzerland had moved to “support financial stability”. British chancellor Jeremy Hunt and the Bank of England have also hailed the deal.</p>
        <p>The 167-year-old Credit Suisse was brought to the brink of financial calamity last week despite a £45bn emergency loan from Switzerland’s central bank.</p>
        <p>The deal was made in tandem with six major central banks, including the Bank of England, taking coordinated action to boost dollar flows to help stem the crisis of confidence gripping more lenders.</p>
        <p>The so-called swap line arrangement, involving the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Bank of Canada and Swiss National Bank (SNB) aimed to "enhance the provision of liquidity" and the "smooth functioning of US dollar funding markets".</p>
        <p>It was hoped that the seven-day-a-week facility, which is due to run until at least the end of April, will be enough to bolster market confidence over the health of other banks, particularly US regional lenders.</p>
        <p>Switzerland said the Credit Suisse deal, which was essentially forced on UBS, was aimed at shoring up confidence in the market.</p>
        <p>UBS’s own shares took a 12 per cent hit in the aftermath of the deal. Deutsche Bank was down 10 per cent, Barclays fell 6 per cent and Lloyds saw a tumble of 4 per cent.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse employs around 5,500 people in the UK, but authorities here were keen to stress on Sunday that the country’s financial system is still safe.</p>
        <p>The Bank of England said: "We welcome the comprehensive set of actions set out by the Swiss authorities today in order to support financial stability.</p>
        <p>"We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation.</p>
        <p>"The UK banking system is well capitalised and funded, and remains safe and sound."</p>
        <p>UBS said job losses were expected at Credit Suisse’s UK office after the historic sale of the Swiss bank, with an impact on the lender’s British workers seen as being “inevitable”.</p>
        <p>The former chief executive of UBS in the UK, Mark Yallop, said he thinks job losses will be “inevitable” as a result of the merger and chopping down the investment bank.</p>
        <p>He told the BBC’s Today programme: “The two firms together employ about 120,000 staff, of which about 11,000 sit in London, and I think it’s inevitable that a merger of this sort will result in some further job losses.</p>
        <p>“I would imagine those would be concentrated in the risky investment banking business at Credit Suisse which is partly the cause of the problems the firms is experiencing.</p>
        <p>“And in middle-office, technology and operational roles where bringing two firms together will mean you can run one bigger firm, without doubling up the infrastructure needed to manage it.”</p>

        <p>BEIJING (AP) — European shares advanced Thursday following a retreat in Asia after Credit Suisse said it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up its finances, possibly easing worries about a bank crisis following the failure of two U.S. lenders.</p>
        <p>London, Frankfurt and Wall Street futures gained. Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong declined as Asian bank stocks slid, reversing Wednesday's gains. Oil prices rose.</p>
        <p>Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 lost 0.7% on Wednesday after Credit Suisse shares fell 30%. That fueled jitters about global banks that are under strain following interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to cool inflation.</p>
        <p>“Expect confidence to remain fragile,” Chris Turner, Francesco Pesole and Frantisek Taborsky of ING said in a report.</p>
        <p>The turmoil over banks will complicate a European Central Bank decision due to be announced Thursday about another possible interest rate hike, they said. It is “casting doubts on whether policymakers will raise rates at all,” they said.</p>
        <p>In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London gained 1.4% to 7,447.53. The DAX in Frankfurt jumped 1.7% to 14,988.39 and the CAC 40 in Paris added 1.7% to 6,999.23. The Swiss Market index was up 1.2%.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&P 500 index was up 0.1%. That for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the Dow lost 0.9% and the Nasdaq composite closed up 0.1%.</p>
        <p>In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo retreated 0.8% to 27,010.61. Mizuho Bank was down 3.9%, while Resona Holdings, a major second-tier bank, lost 4.8%.</p>
        <p>The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 1.7% to 19,203.91. Standard Chartered Plc lost 5.4% and HSBC was 2.4% lower.</p>
        <p>The Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.1% to 3,226.89 after government data Wednesday showed the Chinese economy is recovering more slowly than expected following the lifting of anti-virus controls.</p>
        <p>Search engine Baidu's share price plunged 10% and eventually closed down 6.4% in Hong Kong after the company unveiled its rival to the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT in a pre-recorded rather than a live presentation.</p>
        <p>China's banks don't face the same pressures as foreign lenders because Beijing has held its benchmark lending rate steady since mid-2022 and keeps the country sealed off from global capital flows. State-owned Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Ltd. and Bank of China, Ltd. were up 0.1%.</p>
        <p>The Kospi in Seoul was off less than 0.1% at 2,377.91 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 sank 1.5% to 6,965.50.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse has been fighting troubles for years, including losses from the 2021 collapse of investment firm Archegos Capital.</p>
        <p>Its share price plunge reignited worries about the global industry after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed in the second- and third-biggest U.S. bank failures in history.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, bank stocks plunged Monday, recovered Tuesday and tumbled again Wednesday.</p>
        <p>First Republic Bank sank 21.4%, a day after soaring 27%. JPMorgan Chase slid 4.7%.</p>
        <p>Banks are struggling after the Federal Reserve's fastest series of rate hikes in decades caused prices of assets on their balance sheets to decline.</p>
        <p>Stress in the financial system could push the Fed to hold off on hiking rates at its meeting next week or at least refrain from the larger rate hike it had been potentially signaling. But inflation at 6% in February still is well above the Fed's 2% target.</p>
        <p>Weaker-than-expected economic reports released Wednesday may have allayed some of those worries.</p>
        <p>One showed that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by much more last month than economists expected. It’s still high at a 4.6% level versus a year earlier, but that was better than the 5.4% that was forecast.</p>
        <p>Other data showed that U.S. spending at retailers fell by more than expected last month. Such data could raise worries about a recession on the horizon, but they may also take some pressure off inflation in the near term.</p>
        <p>In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $68.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plummeted $3.72 on Wednesday to $67.61. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading advanced $1.05 cents to $74.74 per barrel in London. It lost $3.76 to $73.69 the previous session.</p>
        <p>The dollar declined to 132.87 yen from Wednesday's 133.46 yen. The euro gained to $1.0615 from $1.0586.</p>

        <h4>SINGAPORE, March 16 (Reuters) -</h4>
        <p>Markets took a moment's respite on Thursday after Credit Suisse said it would borrow as much as 50 billion francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss central bank to steady itself, but trade was very tense as investors worried where banking stress might show up next.</p>
        <p>Asian shares fell but without the frenzied drops seen overnight in Europe. European futures were last up 2%, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.5%.</p>
        <p>Any relief was tinged with fear of what may go wrong next.</p>
        <p>A week ago a start-up lender in California failed and now a systemic bank in one of Europe's financial capitals is in enough trouble to seek authorities' help. Credit Suisse shares dropped 24% on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Safe assets like bonds, gold and dollars were in favour.</p>
        <p>"I think we're getting into the hard hat territory again," said Damian Rooney, a dealer at Perth stockbroker Argonaut.</p>
        <p>"The word contagion is knocking about...we're getting fear across the whole board here," he said. "The trouble is with the unwinding - you don't know what you don't know."</p>
        <p>MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1% to its lowest this year. Japan's bank shares recovered some even deeper early losses, but were last down 4% and the Nikkei dropped 1.3%.</p>
        <p>Insurers, banks, miners and consumer stocks were among the biggest losers across Asia's markets as worries grow that a potential credit crunch can worsen a looming economic slowdown.</p>
        <p>Selling pressure eased for commodities and buying in gold, bonds and dollars backed off but without really recovering any of the losses in growth-exposed assets or handing back much of the astonishing gains that have been seen in bond markets.</p>
        <p>Bonds have soared while markets have radically re-priced the interest rate outlook, betting central banks will be quickly cutting rates while stability fears rattle the financial system.</p>
        <p>Two-year U.S. Treasuries are eying their best week since 1987 and yields, which fall when prices rise, are down more than 66 basis points since Friday.</p>
        <p>An index of bond market volatility - the ICE BofA MOVE index - has hit its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
        <p>'SOMETHING UGLY'</p>
        <p>The European Central Bank's meeting later on Thursday looms as a big test of the bond rally, as the first scheduled policy announcement since bank jitters began in the U.S. last week.</p>
        <p>ECB policymakers had flagged a 50 basis point hike and President Christine Lagarde was just this month saying it was very likely. But market pricing implies just a 10% chance of that happening now and traders are on edge about the outcome.</p>
        <p>"We've got to get through ECB and see how that goes down. And then the impact of that may well impact on what we think about the Fed next week," said ING economist Rob Carnell.</p>
        <p>"I think it's going to be a very volatile period until we get this out of the way...it feels like at these interest rate levels the risk of finding that you've lifted a stone and something ugly is underneath gets higher."</p>
        <p>The euro and Swiss franc found some support from the central bank's help for Credit Suisse, steadying after steep overnight drops.</p>
        <p>The euro last stood at $1.0601 and the franc at 0.9300 to the dollar. The flight to safety lent support to the yen and it rose about 0.5% to 132.75 per dollar.</p>
        <p>The New Zealand dollar fell 0.4% to $0.6161 after growth data missed forecasts.</p>
        <p>($1 = 0.9310 Swiss francs) ($1 = 0.9301 Swiss francs)</p>

        <p>The S&P 500 was also off session lows, down 0.7% at the closing bell. Steel Dynamics (STLD) sold off and fell below its 50-day line. The steelmaker expects lower Q1 profit, according to reports.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq erased most losses and gained less than 0.1% at the close. Tech stocks gave the index some help. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) gained over 2%. Netflix (NFLX) rose 3%. Both stocks were near today's highs at closing time.</p>
        <p>Volume on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq was higher compared to the same time on Tuesday, according to early data.</p>
        <p>Crude oil plunged 6.3% to $67.83 a barrel. Oil giants Halliburton (HAL) and SLB (SLB) fell more than 8% as other energy stocks tumbled.</p>
        <p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 18 basis points to 3.45%. The price of gold rose while Bitcoin fell.</p>
        <p>The run on banks got a reboot on Wednesday. Credit Suisse shares plunged after its largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it would not make further investments in the Swiss bank. That reverses plans last year for  a possible investment of up to 1.5 billion swiss francs.</p>
        <p>First Republic (FRC) got a sharp rating cut to junk rating by S&P Global Ratings on worries that clients are pulling out their money. That is a four-level slash from A- to BB+, according to the Wall Street Journal. The new rating places the stock squarely in speculative territory. Shares dived.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) rose 5% in strong volume after last week's heavy sell-off. CEO Walt Bettinger said the brokerage firm was not in dire straits and would not need to look hastily to raise money to keep running. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and Metropolitan Bank (MCB) were among regional banks that reversed from steep losses.</p>

        <p>Shares of fertilizer maker Bunge (BG) fell 7.5%, reversing gains from Tuesday. Shares rallied 14% Tuesday on news that Corteva (CTVA) and Chevron (CVX) had partnered with Bunge for plant-based oil products.</p>
        <p>In economic data, wholesale prices rose less in February compared to January. Excluding food and energy, they were unchanged.

        <p>Stocks were tumbling—until the Swiss National Bank offered to support  Credit Suisse Group CS –13.94%  if necessary. That news caused the market to bounce and hold an important level of technical support.</p>
        <p>The day began with Credit Suisse (CS) emerging as the latest bank to be the focus of investor concerns after the Saudi National Bank said it wouldn’t provide more financing. The news, which came after SVB’s collapse, caused the S&P 500 to tumble as much as 2.1%, to 3838.24, Wednesday and to give back nearly all of its year-to-date gains. But news that the Swiss National Bank would help support Credit Suisse caused stocks to bounce off their lows and the S&P 500SPX –0.70%  to close down just 0.7% at 3,891.93.</p>
        <p>“Bottom line, the introduction of regional bank contagion has altered the market landscape in the short term, and whether those risks settle or increase will determine if stocks stabilize,” writes Sevens Report’s Tom Essaye. </p>
        <p>Stabilize they did, and at an important level for the market. For the S&P 500, 3850 has been identified as an important support level for stocks, one, that if it broke, would lead to a further drop to the next support level, near 3700. And if that level were to break, the index could fall to its bear market low of just below 3600. In a worst-case scenario—or at least a bad one—the S&P 500 could fall to 3000, writes John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. </p>
        <p>That level would make sense from a fundamental perspective, too. More economic weakness from here—in addition to that created by the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes—would pressure earnings estimates, estimates that already look too high. Analyst’s aggregate 2023 earnings per share forecasts for S&P 500 companies sit at about $221 right now, according to FactSet, just above last year’s $216.</p>
        <p>But if the economy slows, estimates could get reduced to $210 or even lower as the market loses confidence in the economy and corporate earnings power. That alone would put the S&P 500 at about 3640 at a current based on the S&P 500’s current multiple of 17.3 times 12-month forward earnings.</p>
        <p>Declining earnings would likely mean declining valuations, writes Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, perhaps earning the S&P 500 a multiple as low as 14 times. At that level, the index would trade at 2940, down 24% from Wednesday’s close.</p>

        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished in the red this Monday as the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm (SIVB) led to a weak start to the week on the markets.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 2.25% to close at 7,574 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris tumbled 2.58% to 7,034 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 2.66% to 15,017.</p>
        <p>Across the pond, US stocks started off the week with a sour sentiment before bouncing back after federal banking regulators took aggressive actions to stem the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.47% to 32,060 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.49% to 3,880 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 1.13% to 11,264.</p>
        <p>President Joe Biden addressed the nation on Monday regarding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Biden said that “no losses will be borne by the taxpayers” and he assured customers that they would be protected. The president also vowed to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen rules for banks.</p>
        <p>Biden explained that he instructed his team to protect US workers and small businesses and detailed their actions to protect customers' deposits and not put taxpayer dollars at risk, to hold those responsible accountable, and not to protect investors in the bank.</p>
        <p>Back in London, HSBC (HSBA.L) bought the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank (SVBUK), securing the deposits of more than 3,000 customers worth £6.7bn ($8bn).</p>
        <p>The Treasury said the deal with HSBC involved no taxpayer money and the Bank of England said deposits were secure.</p>
        <p>HSBC said it paid just £1 for SVBUK after the bank failed on Friday.</p>
        <p>All SVBUK services will continue to operate as normal and customers should not notice any changes, the statement said.</p>
        <p>"This acquisition makes excellent strategic sense for our business in the UK," HSBC said.</p>
        <p>"It strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the UK and internationally," Noel Quinn, HSBC group chief executive, said.</p>
        <p>Silicon Valley Bank — which specialised in lending to technology companies — was shut down by US regulators on Friday in the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.</p>
        <p>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “Today the government and the Bank of England have facilitated a private sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK. This ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.</p>
        <p>“I am pleased we have reached a resolution in such short order.</p>
        <p>“HSBC is Europe’s largest bank, and SVBUK customers should feel reassured by the strength, safety and security that brings them.”</p>
        <p>"HSBC shareholders may have some concerns about the bank snapping up assets which have been under such a cloud of uncertainty, particularly the exposure to bonds, but HSBC says it expects a gain to arise from the acquisition.</p>
        <p>"This will be hugely welcomed by the government, given the looming crisis risked overshadowing budget day, as a big tech sector bailout would not have been a good look when millions have been told there is little extra money to ease the cost of living crisis."</p>
        <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: "It means that SVBUK will avoid insolvency proceedings and its customers will be able to access deposits and banking services as normal from today. European markets look set to open higher as a crisis in the banking sector is averted for now."</p>
        <p>Dom Hallas, executive director of Coadec, a lobby group representing UK tech start-ups, said Monday’s deal “saved hundreds of the UK’s most innovative companies".</p>
        <p>Financial stocks were among the fallers in London, with Standard Chartered (STAN.L) losing 6.52%, investment manager abrdn (ABDN.L) off 3.41%, and Barclays (BARC.L) falling 5.79%.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $82 per barrel amid concerns of further interest rate increases.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.11% to 27,832 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.98% to 19,702. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, climbing 1.20% to 3,268 points.</p>

        <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell Monday, while Nasdaq futures rose after a flurry of news Sunday evening. The FDIC and other financial regulators announced that all SVB Financial depositors would get access to all funds Monday, while also announcing a plan to limit the contagion. Regulators also closed embattled Signature Bank (SBNY).</p>
        <p>Treasury yields plummeted while Fed rate hike odds faded, but bank stocks continued to sell off, including such as First Republic Bank (FRC), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) as regulators stressed their would be no bailouts for shareholders.</p>
        <p>President Biden will speaking on the banking crisis at 9 a.m. ET.</p>
        <p>First Republic stock crashed more than 60% Monday morning, even after saying it got fresh funding from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan. Western Alliance also is off over 60% as well. Schwab lost 6% despite a Citigroup upgrade. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which found support on Friday, fell 1% even with a Wells Fargo upgrade. Bank of America (BAC) retreated 3%. The XLF financial ETF fell modestly and KRE regional bank ETF declined sharply.</p>
        <p>The stock market suffered big losses last week as SVB Financial (SIVB) and crypto bank Silvergate Financial (SI) collapsed, triggering intense losses for bank stocks. The major indexes sold off hard, breaking multiple areas of support during the week as many leading stocks also came under pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
        <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.7% after surging more than 1% Sunday night. S&P 500 futures sank 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.%. Futures are active and volatile.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which dived last week on safe-haven flows, tumbled 21 basis points to 3.48%. But the 2-year Treasury yield plunged 50 basis points to 4.9%, as Fed rate hike odds fall.</p>
        <p>Markets are now pricing in just one quarter-point rate hike, with a solid chance that the Fed will pause on March 22. A few days ago, markets expected 50 basis points on March 22, with at least two more quarter-point hikes after that.</p>
        <p>Crude oil futures plunged 5%.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin rose sharply Sunday and largely held those gains Monday morning. The cryptocurrency tumbled last week on the Silvergate and SVB collapses.</p>
        <p>In other news, Pfizer (PFE) will buy Seagen (SGEN) for $229 a share, with an enterprise value of $43 billion, following weeks of talks. PFE stock fell modestly while SGEN stock leapt nearly 20%. Sanofi (SNY) will acquire Provention Bio (PRVB) for $2.9 billion, or $25 a share. SNY stock was little changed while PRVB stock more than tripled.</p>
        <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
        <p>The video embedded in this article discussed the market action in depth while also analyzing JPMorgan Chase, Palo Alto Networks and META stock.</p>
        <p><strong>FDIC, Regulators Protect SVB Financial Depositors</strong></p>
        <p>Shortly after Dow futures opened, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve issued a joint statement that SVB Financial's "[d]epositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13." They also announced that Signature Bank, which had a lot of crypto exposure, would be closed due to systemic risks. Signature Bank's depositors also will be protected.</p>
        <p>California regulators shut down SVB Financial and its Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary on Friday, the largest bank failure since Washington Mutual in the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
        <p>The FDIC held an auction over the weekend for Silicon Valley Bank, with final bids due Sunday afternoon, according to multiple reports. No winner has been announced.</p>
        <p>HSBC Holdings (HSBC) will buy SVB's U.K. arm for just over $1.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Fed is creating a new financial backstop for other banks. The facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks and other institutions. They'll have to pledge high-quality collateral such as Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Notably, that collateral will be valued at par, not mark to market. Banks have been sitting on unrealized debt losses as Fed rate hikes sent rates soaring over the past year. That was a big facto in SVB Financial's collapse.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of companies, including many venture capital and tech startups, have deposits or business ties to Silicon Valley Bank. There were reports that many will struggle to meet payroll without access to accounts soon.</p>
        <p>Notably, SVB and SBNY shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected.</p>
        <p>Stocks Near Buy Points</p>
        <p>Amid a weak, volatile, uncertain market, investors should not be making new position trades and instead be largely or entirely in cash. But keep an eye on stocks holding up near buy points. Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and United Airlines (UAL) are five stocks showing strength, near buy points. PANW stock has formed a handle on a long consolidation, while META stock has a new flat base. ULTA stock is finding support at key levels. Monolithic Power is working on a long cup-with-handle base while UAL stock has retreated from a buy zone.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has a new flat base as well. Tesla (TSLA) sold off hard this past week, but did find support at its 10-week line on Friday. TSLA stock is far from being actionable. Wolfe Research downgraded Tesla to peer perform on Monday, saying the SVB collapse adds to macro pressures.</p>
        <p>Insulet (PODD) will replace SIVB stock in the S&P 500 before Wednesday's open. PODD stock jumped Friday night.</p>
        <p>PANW stock is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist. MPWR stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders watchlist. Monolithic Power, United Airlines and ULTA stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
        <p><strong>Stock Market Weekly Action</strong></p>
        <p>The stock market started off higher but quickly reversed lower for major losses on Fed rate hike fears and later the SVB Financial and Silvergate shutdowns.</p>
        <p>Twice on Friday, stocks bounced as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed confidence in a "resilient" banking system. But the positive momentum quickly faded.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4.4% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index sold off 4.55%. The Nasdaq composite skidded 4.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dived 8%.</p>
        <p>Apple stock fell just 1.7% for the week to 148.50, holding above its 200-day line. But that's after reversing from Monday's intraday high of 156.30, nearly hitting AAPL's 157.48 buy point.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury yield plunged 29 basis points to 3.69% this past week, after hitting a 2023 high of 4.09% on March 2. The 2-year yield tumbled 27 basis points to 4.59%, including 31 basis points on Friday and 48 points on Thursday-Friday.</p>
        <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell 3.8% to $76.68 a barrel this past week, but did rise on Friday.</p>
        <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
        <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) plunged just over 6% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) slumped 3.4%.  The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gave up 5.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 3%, with MPWR stock an SMH holding.</p>
        <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) dived 10.9% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 11.4%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. TSLA fell 12.3% for the week, amid fresh price cuts and safety probes. But shares edged up on Friday.</p>
        <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) sold off 11.1% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 7.1%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 4.8, with UAL stock a key component. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 4.85%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gave up 5.3%.  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) slumped 3.85% to the lowest point since October.</p>
        <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dived 8.5%, with JPMorgan and SCHW stock big holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) plummeted 15.7%, its worst weekly loss since the Covid crash in March 2020. SIVB stock and Western Alliance are notable components.</p>
        <p><strong>Market Analysis</strong></p>
        <p>The stock market suffered damaging losses this past week, with the major indexes selling off hard and breaking through multiple support levels. The indexes tried to bounce back from early losses Friday, briefly turning positive, before tumbling to fresh lows.</p>
        <p>The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 tumbled through their 21-day lines early in the week and finished decisively below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 finished Friday below the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones is at its worst levels since early November.</p>
        <p>Fed chief Jerome Powell's signal that he favors "faster" rate hikes hit the market on Tuesday-Wednesday. But SVB Financial and crypto bank Silvergate Capital rocked banks late in the week.</p>
        <p>A Friday morning rebound attempt fizzled as the FDIC announced SVB Financial's failure.</p>
        <p>If bank contagion fears grow, that would be grim for Wall Street and the economy. However, if SVB Financial's woes are seen as isolated and broader banking fears quickly fade, that could restore overall market confidence. But that would also likely send Treasury yields and the dollar rebounding higher, with Fed rate hike odds also increasing.</p>
        <p>The odds of a half-point Fed rate hike surged from 30% on Monday to over 80% following Fed chief Powell's testimony, then fell back below 40% on Friday. The odds fell further over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Leading stocks also sold off hard last week. A number of names held up for much of the week, but most of those were struggling by Friday's close.</p>
        <p>Up until Thursday, Friday's jobs report and the upcoming March 14 CPI inflation report seemed like major events. And they are still important. A relatively tame CPI inflation rate could give Fed chief Powell and his colleagues the excuse they need to raise rates by only a quarter-point.</p>
        <p>But in the very near term, Wall Street will likely take its cue from the banking sector. So pay attention to banks, from the biggest recent losers such as First Republic to broad ETFs and relative stalwarts such as JPM stock.</p>
        <p>JPMorgan was the S&P 500's second-best stock on Friday, even as SBNY stock, First Republic and Schwab were the worst performers. That's a sign that investors see JPMorgan as relatively safe. But if JPM stock breaks this past week's lows, that would be concerning.</p>
        <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
        <p>The stock market is selling off hard amid bad news and even-greater uncertainty.</p>
        <p>This is not a healthy environment. Investors should be largely or entirely on the sidelines, waiting to see how this shakes out. If conditions clear up in a few days or weeks, new buying opportunities will arise.</p>
        <p>Build your watchlists with a focus on the stocks showing strong relative strength. If they're near potential buy points like META stock, Monolithic Power or Palo Alto, great. But that's not the priority right now.</p>

        <p>A 33% plunge in the previously high-flying Nasdaq Composite is the perfect time for growth investors to pounce on some amazing deals.</p>
        <p>While I hate being the bearer of bad news, stock market corrections are a perfectly normal part of the investing cycle. Since the beginning of 1950, the benchmark S&P 500 has undergone 39 separate double-digit percentage corrections, according to data from sell-side consultancy firm Yardeni Research. In other words, the drubbing Wall Street took in 2022 is par for the course when investing for the long run.</p>
        <p>When the major indexes crossed the finish line last year, it was the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) that was hit hardest. The Nasdaq, which led the broader market to new highs in 2021, shed 33% of its value in 2022 and continues to stew in a bear market.</p>
        <p>But there's a silver lining in this bad news. Though we'll never be able to forecast exactly when a bear market will occur or how steep the decline will be, we do know that every previous bear market in the major U.S. stock indexes (including the Nasdaq) was eventually whisked away by a bull market. It effectively means that every bear market is the ideal time to put your money to work.</p>
        <p>It's an especially lucrative time to go shopping for growth stocks. What follows are five stunning growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
        <p><strong>Nio</strong></p>
        <p>The first phenomenal growth stock just begging to be bought during the bear market decline is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO). Although supply chain issues continue to weigh on Nio's production expansion efforts, a number of headwinds have been safely put in the back seat.</p>
        <p>For the past couple of years, China stocks carried extra investment risk due to the country's zero-COVID strategy, as well as the possible delisting of China stocks by U.S. regulators. However, China has abandoned its zero-COVID strategy and reopened its economy. What's more, regulators gained hold of three years' worth of financial audits for Chinese firms, which removes the fear of delisting. In short, Nio is considerably de-risked from where things stood four months ago.</p>
        <p>But what's really been impressive about this company is its various forms of innovation. Nio has been introducing at least one new EV each year and has seen sales of its ET7 and ET5 sedans take off since hitting showrooms last year. With the exception of January, when production was constrained by factory closures as a result of the Chinese New Year, Nio has delivered in excess of 10,000 EVs every month since June 2022, with its sedans regularly accounting for more than half of those deliveries.</p>
        <p>Nio's out-of-the-box innovation is on display as well. In August 2020, the company announced the rollout of its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription. BaaS allows its EV buyers to charge, swap, and upgrade batteries at more than 1,300 power swap stations and more than 1,200 power charger stations. In exchange for a reduced EV purchase price, Nio nets high-margin, recurring subscription revenue from buyers via BaaS and keeps buyers loyal to the brand.</p>
        <p><strong>Exelixis</strong></p>
        <p>The second amazing growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is biotech stock Exelixis (EXEL). Despite occasional clinical trial failures, cancer-drug developer Exelixis is well positioned to grow by double digits.</p>
        <p>A little over a week ago, Exelixis announced that a late-stage study involving its blockbuster drug Cabometyx in combination with Roche's Tecentriq failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in a trial for patients with previously treated advanced kidney cancer.  But failures happen. It's part of being a drug developer.</p>
        <p>What's far more important is that Exelixis has around six dozen clinical trials ongoing involving Cabometyx as a monotherapy or combination treatment for a variety of cancer types. It only takes a handful of success stories to significantly expand Cabometyx's sales and pricing power. We've already witnessed one of these studies finding the mark, which led to Exelixis and Bristol Myers Squibb gaining first-line approval for their combination treatment for renal cell carcinoma.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Exelixis has the cash to fund ongoing internal development, collaborations, and possibly even acquisitions. The company closed out 2022 with approximately $1.31 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and had another $756.7 million in long-term investments. </p>
        <p><strong>Walt Disney</strong></p>
        <p>A third stunning growth stock you'll regret not adding during the Nasdaq bear market drop is the popular "House of Mouse," Walt Disney (DIS). Though Walt Disney is a mature business, it's expected to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate for the next half-decade. That absolutely makes it a growth stock.</p>
        <p>The biggest competitive edge that Disney offers is that its business can't be duplicated. While there are other theme parks consumers can visit and other movies on the big screen, Disney's characters and stories, along with the emotion, engagement, and imagination they evoke in consumers, can't be duplicated by any other company.</p>
        <p>As I've previously suggested, the value of this irreplaceability can be seen in Walt Disney's pricing power. Since Disneyland opened its doors in Southern California in 1955, admission prices have risen by 10,300%. By comparison, the U.S. inflation rate has jumped a little over 1,000% over the same time span.  Disney has also been able to raise prices on its ad-free streaming service, Disney+, while losing only a small fraction of its subscribers. </p>
        <p>The next step in Walt Disney's evolution is turning its money-losing streaming segment into a profit machine. Newly reappointed CEO Bob Iger increased monthly subscription prices and is targeting profitability for this segment toward the end of fiscal 2024. Once streaming becomes cash-flow positive, I'd be surprised to see Disney stock anywhere near $100 per share.</p>
        <p><strong>Innovative Industrial Properties</strong></p>
        <p>The fourth magnificent growth stock that you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq's bear market swoon is marijuana-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). In spite of rent-collection speed bumps in recent months, IIP, as Innovative Industrial Properties is known, can show patient investors the green.</p>
        <p>The prevailing concern with IIP is that its on-time rental collection rate has dropped from 100% to 92% as of the end of February 2023. But it's important to understand that all REITs eventually deal with delinquencies. It's how companies handle their delinquencies that matters. IIP's fourth-quarter report and year-to-date update shows it's working through these delinquencies and should be able to sustain these revenue streams or outright sell these properties for cash.</p>
        <p>Another key point with Innovative Industrial Properties is that 100% of its properties are triple-net leased (also known as "NNN leased"). NNN-leased properties require the tenant to cover all expenses, including utilities, maintenance, and even property tax and insurance. While NNN leases reduce the rental income IIP can expect to receive, it also removes any chance of surprise expenses or inflation hurting the company.</p>
        <p>Lastly, Innovative Industrial Properties might be one of the few pot stocks benefiting from weed remaining illegal at the federal level. Since most cannabis companies have limited access to basic financial services, IIP has been able to work out sale-leaseback agreements that benefit both parties. Cultivators and processors get cash they sorely need from IIP, and IIP lands long-term tenants through this program.</p>
        <p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>
        <p>A fifth stunning growth stock that you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, autonomous vehicle company Waymo, and streaming platform YouTube.</p>
        <p>At the moment, advertising weakness is Alphabet's biggest headwind. When the probability of a recession materializing rises, advertisers pull back on their spending. But this is also a two-sided coin. Even though recessions are inevitable, they're typically short-lived. Buying ad-driven stocks during these short swoons often allows investors to take advantage of long-winded economic expansions.</p>
        <p>Alphabet's competitive advantage isn't going away anytime soon, either. Since December 2018, data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for roughly 91% to 93% of global internet search share. Having a 90-percentage-point lead over its next-closest competitor allows Google to command significant pricing power for ad placement.</p>
        <p>Alphabet's ancillary operating segments provide plenty of promise, too. YouTube is the second most visited social platform in the world, with Shorts getting more than 50 billion daily views. Meanwhile, Google Cloud has worked its way up to a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure-service spending. </p>
        <p>Based on both forward-year earnings and future cash flow, Alphabet is cheaper now than at any point since it became a publicly traded company.</p>

        <p>MasterCard (MA) closed at $361.50 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.67% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 12.91%.</p>
        <p>Coming into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 5.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 5.68%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.54%.</p>
        <p>Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.70, down 2.17% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.61 billion, up 8.58% from the year-ago period.</p>
        <p>MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.13 per share and revenue of $25.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.9% and +12.55%, respectively.</p>
        <p>It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.</p>
        <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
        <p>The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% higher. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
        <p>Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MasterCard has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.32 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.8, which means MasterCard is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, MA's PEG ratio is currently 1.68. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Financial Transaction Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.18 based on yesterday's closing prices.</p>
        <p>The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, putting it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.</p>
        <p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- US stocks ended the week on a high note, driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates beyond peak levels already priced in.</p>
        <p>A rally in the S&P 500 Friday helped snap a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 scored its best day since early February. Sentiment remained upbeat despite a report showing resilience in the service sector, as some investors wagered the impact of the Fed’s hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers showed costs rising at a slower pace, which was cheered by traders.</p>
        <p>Bond yields rose for the week though Treasuries rallied on Friday, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.96%. A benchmark of the dollar had its worst week since mid-January, ending four consecutive weeks of gains.</p>
        <p>All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls report next week for clues on whether the economy can handle more rate hikes. Data this week showed continued labor-market resilience in the US, supporting the case for the Fed to stick to its tightening policy, a theme that had pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.</p>
        <p>But investors were heartened after Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that the central bank could possibly pause its rate hikes sometime this summer. Traders interpreted his comments as dovish, even though Bostic and his colleagues said decisions would continue to be data dependent and a Fed report on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are in store.</p>

        <p>Traders are still optimistic because even the most hawkish Fed officials haven’t suggested that rates could need to go beyond levels already baked in, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. Swap markets have been pricing a peak Fed policy rate of 5.5% in September.</p>
        <p>“I think they stay at 5.5% and we have to see how data evolves in the second quarter,” she said on Bloomberg Television.</p>
        <p>Misra also added that robust data doesn’t mean the Fed’s persistent tightening isn’t working.</p>
        <p>“It takes a long time,” she said. “Policy only turned restrictive last year.”</p>

        <p>Risk sentiment also received a boost on Friday from forecast-beating factory data from China. Oil gained for the fourth day, with confidence in China’s robust rebound supporting prices.</p>

        <p><strong>Stock Traders Are Ignoring Blaring Bond Alarms</strong></p>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- The fixed-income market’s unblemished record of striking fear into the hearts of equity traders is in danger.</p>
        <p>With rates on two- and 10-year Treasuries up a sixth straight week, and payouts on cash at or above the earnings yield of the S&P 500, stock investors are barely registering a shrug. Benchmark US share indexes just posted their biggest runup in a month, climaxing Friday with a jump in the Nasdaq 100 that topped any since early February.</p>
        <p>Why peace is breaking out in risky assets during a week that at one point saw yields in the entire Treasury market rise above 4% is a mystery Wall Street has no easy answer for. Charts may be one reason: the S&P 500 bounced sharply after falling below its 200-day average on Wednesday. Another may be that investors are interpreting elevated rates as a sign strong economic data is likely to persist, says Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance LLC.</p>
        <p>“It’s interesting to see stocks whistling past the graveyard,” Zaccarelli said. “Stock investors may be looking for yields to drop as a sign we are going to have a recession and are seeing an all-clear in the sense that rates are higher.”</p>
        <p>The indifference to calamity on display in stocks was particularly vivid as the week ended. Friday’s 1.6% gain in the S&P 500 pushed the Cboe Volatility Index below 19, testing lows hit when equities surged at the start of the year. A basket of most-shorted stocks rose 3.2% — it’s fifth straight advance — while a gauge of unprofitable technology companies vaulted almost 6%.</p>
        <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-84-1.webp" alt="ncx-blogs" />
        <p>It’s happening even as money cascades out of stock-focused ETFs and into fixed-income funds, as risk-free yields reach multi-year highs. Short-dated Treasury bills are enticing investors as yields push above 5%, eclipsing the payout on everything from profits generated by S&P 500 companies to those offered by the traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>But while the trade is touted as risk free, it comes with opportunity costs. Grasping for a 5% yield right in an S&P 500 bear market strikes certain money managers as an iffy proposition.</p>
        <p>“That short rate isn’t going to be at those levels forever — it’s probably going to end up lower,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. “What we’ve seen over long periods of time is that the long-term assets outperform cash. And we have every reason to believe that’s going to be the case.”</p>
        <p>Over the past year, the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill exchange-traded fund (ticker BIL) has returned about 2%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 6.3% on a total return basis. However, over the past decade BIL is flat, while SPY soared 165% during an epic bull run.</p>
        <p>“There’s much less ‘opportunity cost’ than what we’re used to because it’s a place where you can get paid while you wait, but there’s not long-term price potential like in equities,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “So for people with more than a five-year time horizon, you still need equities in the portfolio to set you up for compounding returns.”</p>
        <p>The notion that yields may be peaking also has investors preaching caution when it comes to bonds. While bets have been building in recent weeks that the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates past 5% to stamp out inflation — boosting yields across the Treasury curve — traders are pricing in an end to increases by September.</p>
        <p>Tipp hearkened back to the 1970s, when inflation was a threat to both stocks and bonds. As growth moderated and rates leveled off and then came down, equities rose — even though the economy remained weak.</p>
        <p>“There’s a good chance that that kind of cyclicality is going to make its way through the markets, and people that lock in at the short term, exit the long-term markets and go into short term are going to suffer,” he said. “Their long-term returns are not going to be as high because the cash rates will probably move lower.”</p>
        <p>Analysts say that the haven appeal of cash-like positions combined with reliable returns means investors have an attractive place to wait out any turbulence induced by the Fed’s path.</p>
        <p>“I do think that we need to take advantage of the higher yields on the short-end of the yield curve, wait out this continued volatility,” David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview. “And then at some point we’ll hit a bottom, and that will be a great time to re-risk, take that money out of cash, put it back in equities and you’ll benefit from that.”</p>
        <p>Six-month Treasury bills currently yield about 5.1%, the highest since 2007, compared to the S&P 500’s earnings yield of roughly 5.3%. That’s the slimmest advantage for stocks since 2001.</p>
        <p>Though bonds look attractive at current yields relative to equities, the risk investors are taking in allocating to cash is the uncertainty of that yield going forward, said Josh Emanuel, chief investment officer at Wilshire, which oversees roughly $90 billion.</p>
        <p>“So, cash may pay you 4.5-5% today, but in one year that may not be the case, in two years that may not be the case,” he said in an interview. “The challenge in allocating to cash is that while you’re not taking any duration risk and you’re not taking any credit risk, the risk that you’re taking is the opportunity cost or the uncertainty risk associated with what that cash will pay you in the future relative to the yield you can lock in over the longer-term by moving out further on the yield curve.”</p>

        <h3>S&P 500 Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
        <p>The S&P 500 initially dipped during the trading week to show signs of weakness, only to turn around and show signs of life again. We are back above the 4000 level, so that of course is a good sign, but at the end of the day, this is a market that looks as if it is trying to roll over. Keep in mind that we have just gone through a significant portion of earnings, and it’s been a mixed bag to say the least.</p>
        <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the week, then it is likely that we could go down to the 3800 level, an area that previously had been rather supportive. By bouncing from there, it puts an imprint of support in that region that I think a lot of people will be paying attention to. On the upside, we have the 4100 level, which was previous support, but even more importantly we have the 4200 level above that has caused quite a bit of selling pressure, almost like a brick wall. That’s an area where we continue to see a lot of noise, so it does make a target that a lot of people may look for, but breaking above there might be a completely different question.</p>
        <p>You can see that I had a channel drawn previously, and we did break out of it only to turn around and retest that area for potential support. Either way, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility, so longer term traders may struggle.</p>

        <p>Scenes near Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), in New York</p>
        <p>By Mehnaz Yasmin</p>
        <p>(Reuters) - The reward for holding U.S. stocks over Treasury bonds has not been this unattractive since 2004, possibly setting the stage for the sought-after 60/40 portfolio diversification to make a comeback after one of its worst years on record.</p>
        <p>A 60/40 portfolio, which typically has 60% of its holdings in stocks and the remaining 40% in fixed income, counts on moves in the two asset classes to offset one another, with stocks strengthening amid economic optimism and bonds rising during turbulent times.</p>
        <p>The strategy took a backseat in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to rein in inflation. However, signals from the stock and bond markets this year are pointing to a return of the popular asset allocation strategy.</p>
        <p>At the end of February, the S&P 500 returned 5.41% in earnings yield, the reciprocal of price-to-earnings ratio, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond surged to 3.94%, according to data from Refinitiv. The 1.47 percentage-point difference is the lowest upside stocks have held over bonds in nearly two decades.</p>
        <p>Earnings yield here refers to the S&P 500 earnings per share estimate for the next 12 moths divided by the index price.</p>
        <p>Graphic:https://www.reuters.com/graphics/STOCK-SPREADS/CHART/byprlqxyepe/chart.png</p>
        <p>"The relative shine of equities is definitely dulled by rising yields across the Treasury curve," said Eric Leve, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management firm Bailard.</p>
        <p>With estimates for earnings in 2023 implying essentially no growth over 2022, rates above 5% on short-term bonds and 10-year yields on the verge of 4% represent credible alternatives to stocks, according to Leve.</p>
        <p>The thinning spread between returns from stocks and bonds is set to bring the 60/40 portfolio strategy back in favor.</p>
        <p>"This strategy does provide excellent hedging in current environment," said Glenn Yin, Head of Research and Analysis at AETOS Capital Group.</p>
        <p>The 60/40 portfolio has already had the best start to the year since 1991, according to Bank of America.</p>
        <p>The Fed's move to tighten monetary policy at the fastest pace in decades pumped up bond yields after nearly two years of near-zero interest rates.</p>
        <p>But a rise in yields poses headwinds for equities, especially growth stocks, and by extension, a large index like the S&P 500. Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among the tech heavyweights that make up nearly a fifth of the index and bore the brunt of a sell-off last year.</p>
        <p>"Equity yields will continue to struggle this year as both prices and earnings decline" amid an economic slowdown, said Lance Roberts, Chief Investment Strategist at RIA Advisors.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, "during a recession, yields will fall and Treasury bond prices will rise," said Roberts. He prefers bonds over stocks today, he added.</p>
        <p>Recent results and guidance from companies have bolstered the case for investors who believe the stock market's early-year rally is unlikely to last.</p>
        <p>As of Feb. 24, results from 465 of the S&P 500 companies showed fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have fallen 3.2% from the year-ago quarter while Wall Street's expectation for S&P earnings growth for 2023 fell to 1.7% from an expected 4.4% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>Expectations for U.S. earnings to decline in the first two quarters if the year come amid weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results for 2022, which Credit Suisse estimates will be the worst earnings season outside of a recession in 24 years.</p>
        <p>Investors are hoping that in case of a severe recession, the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates. While the economic downturn would hit stock returns, drop in bond yields should provide some relief in such a scenario, according to analysts.</p>
        <p>"For me, the best risk-reward portfolio in this environment for now is long duration Treasury bonds, and deep value, dividend equities," Roberts said. Deep value refers to stocks that are trading at a huge discount to their intrinsic values.</p>
        <p>"When the recession arrives, and the Fed cuts rates to zero, I will sell my bond portfolio to lock in the capital appreciation, and buy distressed equities with high yields and companies with strong balance sheets and earnings growth," he added.</p>

        <p>Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are moving in Friday's intraday trading.</p>
        <p><strong>Video Transcript</strong></p>
        <p>[AUDIO LOGO]</p>
        <p>- Yeah. And taking a look at the market reaction here this morning too. You do see a little bit of just before the start of that 10:00 AM hour, it's moved lower off of, though, some of the intraday highs that we had seen early in today's trading activity on the Dow Jones Industrial average. Still holding onto gains of about a quarter of a percent in the green.</p>
        <p>The NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that also in positive territory. Up triple digits on a point basis. Percentage basis, it's up by about 1%. We'll round that off too. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 7/10 of a percent right now. Still holding on to those gains.</p>
        <p>And additionally, checking in on the major sectors here. The S&P 500 11. Taking a look at those sectors, and XLB is leading the pack, at least on that previous time scale that was loaded up on the screen. XLRE here on the day, on this Fri-yay, it's higher by about 1.25%. But you've got XLP. Yeah, indeed. Consumer staples not looking so hot, hot, hot. Down by about 7/10 of a percent here this morning, and we'll continue to watch that as we move on throughout the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>Overall though, you've got more gainers than laggards here, and we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. Taking a look at some of the Dow components as well. Apple is really leading the charge today. You're seeing that higher by about 2.5%. We've got much more on that this hour as well. And taking a look at the NASDAQ, you've also got a pretty mixed picture here. We'll kind of put this on a broader heat map view. It looks like more gainers than laggards. Just a rough look at things here on the day.</p>
