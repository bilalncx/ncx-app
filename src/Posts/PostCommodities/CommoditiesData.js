    	<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil futures climbed about 1% to a one-week high on Friday as U.S. diesel prices soared, the number of oil rigs dropped and a fire broke out at a refinery in Louisiana.</p>	
    	<p>Brent futures rose $1.12, or 1.3%, to settle at $84.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 78 cents, or 1.0%, to settle at $79.83.</p>	
    	<p>Diesel futures soared about 5% to a near seven-month high, boosting the diesel crack spread, a measure of refining profit margins, to its highest since January 2023.</p>
      <p>"The main thing was concern about diesel prices, the diesel crack spread and worries about diesel shortages when refineries go into maintenance," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. He added prices also drew support from a fire at a Louisiana refinery and a drop in U.S. oil rigs.</p>
      <p>Weak economic data and a stronger dollar limited gains. For the week, Brent declined less than 1% and WTI lost about 2%. Last week, both benchmarks fell about 2%.</p>
      <p>A fire in a giant naphtha storage tank was contained on Friday afternoon at Marathon Petroleum's 596,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Garyville, Louisiana refinery.</p>
      <p>In August, U.S. energy firms cut the number of active oil rigs for a ninth straight month, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report.</p>
      <p>Crude prices rose despite weak economic news from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, and the U.S. dollar rose to an 11-week high against a basket of other currencies after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said further interest rate hikes may be needed to fight inflation.</p>
      <p>Higher interest rates can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand. A stronger dollar can also slow demand by making oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.</p>
      <p>U.S. consumer sentiment, meanwhile, fell modestly in August, as short- and long-term inflation expectations worsened, a survey showed on Friday.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they expect Brent prices to be well supported around $80 per barrel, with crude likely to remain in a deficit over the rest of this year before returning to a small surplus in early 2024.</p>
      <p>But the likelihood of crude deficits is no foregone conclusion, said John Evans of oil broker PVM.</p>
      <p>Norwegian energy firm Equinor, for example, said it started production at its extended Statfjord Ost field six months ahead of schedule.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>By David Rosenberg and Bhawana Chhabra</p>
    	<p>In the past two years, the GSCI commodity index has generated a net positive return of 31.6 per cent, while the S&P 500 has delivered a total that barely touches one per cent and the 10-year U.S. Treasury has lost 18.9 per cent.</p>	
    	<p>With that in mind, we decided to see how risk-adjusted returns could be improved if investors tweaked their traditional 60/40 stock/bond asset mix benchmark (which triggered a combined net loss of minus 16 per cent last year) in favour of a model that targeted a 50/25/25 equity/bonds/commodity mix.</p>	
    	<p>We ran iterations on the asset allocation for portfolios across the years and found that commodities are a formidable diversification tool, no matter the season in the financial world.</p>
      <p>There are a few key economic reasons why commodities offer a good hedge. First, commodities are a diversified bunch within themselves: energy commodities and base metals are driven by supply-demand cycles in the economy and hence tend to go up during expansionary cycles. Precious metals such as gold behave more like a safe haven, and everyone flocks to them when things aren’t going well, thus leading to all-season protection from commodities.</p>	
    	<h3>Inflation hedge</h3>
      <p>Second, commodities provide a decent inflation hedge as well, with a historic near-20-per-cent positive statistical relationship. But the real beauty is that commodities have virtually no correlation with the direction of equity markets and have historically commanded an inverse correlation to the movement in bond prices, hence the critical diversifying characteristics.</p>	
    	<p>In essence, the resource or materials sector acts differently than stocks and bonds. The only risk to owning commodities is if the global economy enters a deflation phase as it did in 2001-02 and in 2008-09, but this is why you also want to hedge with a same-sized exposure to Treasury bonds.</p>
      <p>Owing to those reasons, there is no single year going back to 1974 (that’s how far the data history goes) when all three asset classes simultaneously ended the year in red. That is very interesting and underscores the need to limit concentrated bets and focus on diversification at all times.</p>	
    	<p>There is no such thing as a sure thing, and you never want to put all your eggs in one basket. And, critically, what this analysis proves is that true diversification means being involved in more than just two asset classes that, as we saw in 2022, can go down in tandem and rather sharply. Commodity returns in a tough 2022 investing environment were a solid 26 per cent and this gets very little attention.</p>	
    	<p>To understand how portfolios with and without commodities behave during different economic phases, we ran iterations on the classic 60/40 equity/bond portfolio and 50/25/25 equity/bond/commodities portfolio. The results weren’t surprising. Getting commodities in the mix means better returns across most economic phases.</p>
      <p>Across expansionary phases, the 60/40 portfolio has given a median compound annualized growth rate (CAGR) of nearly a sub-10 per cent return, which is lower than the 11 per-cent-return in the 50/25/25 portfolio. The median Sharpe ratio (which adjusts for volatility) for the 50:25:25 portfolio during expansions is 0.8, which is double that of the 60/40 at 0.4.</p>	
    	<p>For recessions going back to 1974, the equity/bond portfolio has provided a 7.2-per-cent total return on a median basis, while the equity/bond/commodities portfolio total CAGR was modestly superior at 7.4 per cent.</p>	
    	<p>While stagflation lasted from 1969 to the end of 1980, our iterations begin from 1973 (owing to limitations on data availability) and for this period, the average CAGR for the 60/40 portfolio was 6.8 per cent versus 13.7 per cent (almost double) for the 50/25/25 portfolio.</p>
      <p>For periods with high inflation, but strong growth (not stagflation but demand-led inflation), the median CAGR total return on the equity/bond portfolio was 4.1 per cent while that of the equity/bond/commodities mix was more than twice as good at 8.5 per cent.</p>	
    	<ul>
        <li>Great China slowdown has wider implications than meet the eye</li>
        <li>Why immigration could be good for housing affordability</li>
        <li>Recession call has the haters out in force</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hence, it is reasonable to assume that investors would do well to maximize their risk-adjusted returns in practically any economic scenario with a 50/25/25 asset mix compared to the traditional 60/40 allocation — even through recessions when bonds provide the buffer. But the key to this 50/25/25 is that you don’t really have to time the business cycle as much as you need to do with 60/40 and that is the major point.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold rose for a fourth straight session to a two-week high on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session fuelled by weaker U.S. data in the run up to likely interest rate guidance from central bankers at Jackson Hole.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold was up 0.3% at $1,919.07 per ounce by 0956 GMT, hitting its highest level since Aug. 10. U.S. gold futures were flat at $1,947.40.</p>	
    	<p>Dollar-priced bullion climbed nearly 1% on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields tumbled after data showed U.S. business activity approached the stagnation point in August. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>"Some economic worries have propelled some safe-haven demand, but gold has been really more or less range-bound" between $1,880 and $1,970, said Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve is holding its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming from Aug. 24 to Aug. 26, with investors waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday for confirmation on whether interest rates are going to stay higher for longer.</p>
      <p>Higher U.S. rates raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, which yields no interest.</p>
      <p>"The centre of attention is on Jackson Hole. The rebound over the past four days is really because gold reached $1,900, and there tends to be some buying-on-dips demand," Fu added.</p>
      <p>Traders also firmed up bets that the European Central Bank would pause hiking interest rates in September, as sharp contractions in business activity pointed to deepening economic pain in Europe.</p>
      <p>Spot silver fell 0.8% to $24.12 per ounce and platinum was down 0.2% at $928.18. Palladium dropped 0.8% to $1,263.78.</p>
      <p>For silver, immediate resistance at $24.50 will be on watch next, and moving past this level may potentially pave the way to retest its year-to-date high of around $26, Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Fatal accidents continue to undermine China’s coal industry, with the latest incident in Shaanxi set to impede plans to raise production if authorities once again ramp up scrutiny of mine safety.</p>
    	<p>A gas explosion on Monday at a mine in China’s third-largest coal province killed 11, halting operations there and ending a month-long run of declining prices for thermal coal. It’s the worst accident since February, when a mine collapse in Inner Mongolia claimed 53 lives and triggered nationwide checks on safety.</p>	
    	<p>If regulators respond in similar fashion, it’ll be difficult to keep raising average monthly levels of output, Hou Jian, an analyst at the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association, told a briefing on Wednesday. The association cut its forecast for annual production by almost 100 million tons to 4.6 billion tons.</p>	
    	<p>China mined nearly 4.5 billion tons last year, a record, as Beijing prioritizes production of its mainstay fuel to safeguard energy security after the economy was blighted by power outages in recent years. But the limits of that expansion are becoming apparent, as the quality of coal declines and all-too-frequent accidents hamper operations.</p>
      <p>The latest disaster affected coal used by the steel industry and coking coal futures in Dalian have climbed over 8% this week to above 1,500 yuan ($206) a ton. Most of China’s coal goes to power generation and the domestic spot price for the thermal variety inched up to around 820 yuan a ton on Wednesday, after falling for nearly a month, according to CCTD.</p>

    	<p>By Ahmad Ghaddar</p>
    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices steadied after earlier declines on Thursday caused bydisappointing economic data from key economies, with investors awaiting a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday for clues on interest rate moves.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude climbed 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $83.27 a barrel by 0855 GMT, after dropping to $82.57 earlier in the session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 4 cents, or 0.1%, to $78.93 a barrel, after falling to $78.22.</p>	
    	<p>Manufacturing data from a host of purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys on Wednesday painted a grim picture of the health of economies across the globe, raising demand concerns, analysts said.</p>
      <p>Japan reported shrinking factory activity for a third straight month in August. Euro zone business activity also declined more than expected, particularly in Germany. Britain's economy looked set to shrink in the current quarter, leaving it in danger of falling into recession.</p>
      <p>U.S. business activity approached the stagnation point in August, with growth at its weakest since February.</p>
      <p>"China's worsening growth momentum is the primary cause of the deterioration in global manufacturing," BCA Research analysts said. "This is weighing on European countries where growth remains heavily exposed to Chinese demand, like Germany," they added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials and policymakers from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan head to Jackson Hole where higher-for-longer interest rate talk may dominate despite a dip in inflationary pressures.</p>
      <p>On the supply side, Iran's crude oil output will reach 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of September, the country's oil minister was quoted as saying by state media, even though U.S. sanctions remain in place.</p>
      <p>U.S. officials are also drafting a proposal that would ease sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, allowing more companies and countries to import its crude oil, if the South American nation moves toward a free and fair presidential election, according to five people with knowledge of the plans.</p>
      <p>A larger than expected fall in U.S. crude inventories helped support the market.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.1 million barrels in the week to Aug. 18 to 433.5 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.8 million-barrel drop.</p>
      <p>However, a climb in U.S. gasoline stocks last week indicated fuel demand has been weaker than expected.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, analysts expect Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), to extend its 1 million bpd voluntary production cut into October to help support the market.</p>

    	<p>With silver prices rebounding, investors saw value in the silver miner after its recent steep fall.</p>
      <h3>What happened</h3>
    	<p>Shares of Hecla Mining (HL 8.25%) shot higher on Wednesday and were up a solid 8.25% at the close. It's a U-turn for the silver stock, which was falling rapidly over the past couple of days after reporting a fire at a key mine. Investors might have seen value in the stock today as prices of precious metals rose on macroeconomic fears.</p>
      <h3>So what</h3>	
    	<p>In August, business activity in the U.S. grew at its slowest pace since February, as reflected in the S&P Global's U.S. Composite Purchasing Managers Index, which fell to 50.4 in August. The reading fell short of the market's expectations as it didn't expect to see the service sector contracting even as the manufacturing sector continues to be under pressure.</p>
      <p>Adding to the disappointment on Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics narrowed its total tally of jobs created in March. In other words, the payroll growth in the year that ended in March was perhaps slower than expected.</p>
      <p>The disappointing economic data raised questions about the strength of the U.S. economy and refueled investors' fears of a recession, compelling some to flock to safe-haven assets like gold and silver. Prices of both precious metals rose on Wednesday, with silver inching nearly 4% higher as industry experts also expect demand from China to recover as Beijing takes steps to slow down the yuan's depreciation.</p>
      <h3>Now what</h3>
      <p>With Hecla Mining stock dropping to its lowest point of the year on Tuesday and trading barely 20% off 52-week lows, investors saw hope in Wednesday's rebound in silver prices. They expect higher prices for the metal to offset at least some of the projected weakness in the miner's production this quarter because of a fire.</p>	
    	<p>Earlier this week, Hecla Mining reported a fire at its Lucky Friday mine in Idaho and said it's expected to hurt the mine's production and costs. Hecla Mining is one of the largest silver producers in the U.S., and Lucky Friday is one of its two largest mines. </p>

    	<p>By Nia Williams</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - A busy oil sands maintenance season and early summer wildfires put a dent in Canadian crude production in the second quarter, but oil companies are ramping up growth over the next two years and will add nearly 8% to Canada's total output, analysts estimate.</p>	
    	<p>The roughly 375,000 barrel per day (bpd) increase in two years would be more than Canada, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, has managed to add over the last five years combined, even after promising European allies it would boost crude output in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.</p>	
    	<p>According to Canada Energy Regulator data, Canadian oil production averaged 4.86 million bpd in 2022, up from 4.61 million bpd in 2018.</p>
      <p>Much of the growth will come from oil sands producers like Cenovus Energy and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) tweaking operations to boost efficiency.</p>
      <p>Companies are also moving forward on so-called "step-out" or "tie-back" oil sands thermal projects, where instead of building an entirely new facility to steam bitumen deposits, they are linking new areas with existing plants to speed up development and lower costs.</p>
      <p>The move to boost output - while continuing to funnel free cash to shareholders - shows producers are confident prices will stay firm, analysts said.</p>
      <p>"Companies can finally say things have recovered enough in the industry that we can maintain returns to shareholders and put some money into production growth," said RBN Energy analyst Martin King.</p>
      <p>Benchmark North American crude has averaged $75.64 a barrel year-to-date, declining from 2022 highs, but above the five-year average of $65.89 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Increasing production would be at odds with the Canadian government's effort to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030, given oil and gas is the country's highest-emitting sector.</p>
      <p>RBN expects total Canadian crude output to increase 175,000 bpd this year and another 200,000 bpd in 2024, while S&P Global Commodity Insights analyst Kevin Birn said annual oil sands production alone will rise around 350,000 bpd by 2025.</p>
      <p>Two-thirds of Canada's crude comes from northern Alberta's oil sands.</p>
      <p>STEP-OUTS AND TIE-BACKS</p>
      <p>Following a lacklustre second quarter, Cenovus downgraded its full-year production forecast due to wildfires, while Suncor Energy, CNRL and MEG Energy warned that output would come in at the lower end of their 2022 guidance after big maintenance turnarounds.</p>
      <p>Output is expected to pick up in the second half of the year, and companies are making progress on tie-in projects.</p>
      <p>Cenovus is building a 17-km (11-mile) pipeline connecting its Narrows Lake site to its Christina Lake processing facility that will add up to 30,000 bpd in 2025 , while CNRL is planning to develop the Pike project, purchased from BP in 2022, by stepping out from its Jackfish and Kirby facilities.</p>
      <p>"It's a great opportunity and quite innovative. Rather than building a central processing facility all way up at the site, we've been able to tie it back to our existing plant," Norrie Ramsay, Cenovus's executive vice-president upstream, told an earnings call this month.</p>
      <p>The new volumes will coincide with the planned start-up of the 600,000 bpd Trans Mountain expansion (TMX) pipeline project in the first quarter of 2024. However, delays to TMX could result in pipeline congestion and force producers to ship crude by rail, adding costs.</p>
      <p>"It'll have to be done by the middle of next year or we'll have to have more rail," said Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The state of China’s economy and demand destruction continues to weigh on the minds of investors as China faces a property crisis, falling exports, and weak consumer spending.</p>
    	<p>These challenges are also reflected in commodities price charts.</p>	
    	<p>For oil, it is a case of weighing up supply and demand concerns, with countries such as Saudi Arabia extending crude output cuts into September with uncertainty over whether they will go deeper and for longer.</p>
      <h3>Oil prices</h3>	
    	<p>On Wednesday, demand concerns are putting more pressure on prices. US crude oil (CL=F), or West Texas Intermediate (WTI), was trading down 0.12% at $80.25 a barrel in early London trade, while Brent (BZ=F) declined 0.54% to $83.57.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of August, WTI has lost about 3% while Brent has lost about 2.40%.</p>
      <p>However, Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said: “There's always been a risk of US rates remaining higher for longer, while China's recovery has been sluggish for months, as has their response to it.</p>
      <p>“We need to see a significant change in the trend of the data to seriously change the outlook for crude and we haven't seen that. It may come over the next month or so but for now, we just appear to have seen crude move into a higher range between $80-$90.”</p>
      <h3>Gold</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, gold (GC=F) was trading higher on Wednesday, up 0.27% at $1,931.20 an ounce.</p>
      <p>Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, noted how the precious metal has been in a $1,900 price level battle.</p>
      <p>“The bulls are really trying their best to keep the price at this level, as it is considered an important level of support. The fresh comment from the Richmond Fed president made traders a little nervous again, as his message was very clear: traders should think carefully if they anticipate that the Fed is done with their interest rate hike cycle.”</p>
      <p>He also noted that any weakness in the dollar could represent an opportunity for gold prices to move higher.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a dozen money managers said that they expect to maintain or raise their exposure to the precious metal in the coming 12 months with gold maintaining its allure, according to a poll by Bloomberg News between 10 August and 22 August.</p>
      <p>More than two-thirds see gold prices rising, and five expect a clear all-time high.</p>
      <p>“We do anticipate there’s pent-up gold demand from investors waiting for the Fed to finish,” Darwei Kung, head of commodities and portfolio manager at DWS Group, said.</p>
      <h3>Base metals</h3>
      <p>Iron ore was among the base metals on the rise on Wednesday, along with Nickel and Copper (HG=F).</p>
      <p>However, gains in metal prices were limited by a firm US dollar as a stronger USD makes it more expensive to buy the greenback-priced metals.</p>
      <p>China’s pledge to provide more support for its flagging economy may have lifted sentiment for the metals.</p>
      <p>However, analysts at ING believe metals will stay under pressure in the second half of the year as the sluggish recovery in China will likely continue to weigh on demand.</p>
      <p>“We believe that any improvements in metals prices will depend on the eventual implementation of China’s stimulus measures and actual demand improvement.”</p>

    	<p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Insurance companies have notified charterers of ships operating in Russia's Black Sea ports of an increase in additional payments known as "war risk premiums", four traders said.</p>
    	<p>A war risk premium was added to the common insurance costs for tankers last year after the start of Russia's military action in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a special military operation.</p>	
    	<p>Military actions in the Black Sea area of Russian and Ukrainian Black Sea ports have escalated since the grain export deal fell apart in mid-July.</p>	
    	<p>Most recently Russia reported several attacks at its Black Sea ports. So far, oil loadings from Russia's Black Sea ports have not been affected by the attacks, but risks are mounting, traders said.</p>
      <p>The war risk premium was increased from around 1% of the cargo's cost to some 1.20-1.25%, the traders said.</p>
      <p>The increase means every voyage will cost $200,000 per one Suezmax tanker (can carry 120,000-200,000 tonnes) more if Russian oil is delivered to India. The rise in the premium means the overall cost of the premium will be almost $1 million.</p>
      <p>Although the sum is not huge it adds to Russia's overall oil export costs, which have soared since February 2022 due to sanctions.</p>
      <p>At the peak of Russian supply and sanctions crisis Russian companies were paying as much as $20 million per tanker towards insurance shipping and freight costs representing more than a third of each cargo's value.</p>
      <p>Traders added the increase was mostly applied to cargoes carrying Russian oil and products, while the premium of cargoes carrying Kazakh origin volumes was generally stable around 1%.</p>
      <p>"Volumes originated from Russia are associated with higher risks than others, though current situation gives insurers lots of reason to raise prices for anyone operating in Russian Black Sea ports," one of the traders said.</p>
      <p>Grain traders have expressed concerns about the security of grains shipments and the rise in war risk premium for oil tankers shows the worries have spread to wider markets.</p>
      <p>Overall crude oil loadings from Black Sea Novorossiisk and CPC terminal account for some 2% of global supply. Oil product exports from Russia's Black Sea ports is about 4 million tonnes per year.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices jumped 1% to a near two-week high on Wednesday, helped by a pullback in U.S. bond yields and the dollar as investors looked ahead to the Jackson Hole symposium for guidance on interest rates.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold rose 1% to $1,916.20 per ounce by 2:17 p.m. EDT (1817 GMT), after hitting its highest since Aug. 11. It was also poised to register its biggest daily percentage rise in over a month.</p>
      <p>U.S. gold futures settled 1.1% higher at $1,948.10.</p>
      <p>"It (gold) was a little oversold ahead of itself and we're getting a bounce on some bargain hunting and then short covering," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, adding that a slight dip in yields is also helping.</p>	
      <p>Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields slipped from near 16-year highs hit in the previous session, while the dollar fell after weak U.S. PMI data, making gold more attractive for other currency holders. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>The S&P Global's flash U.S. composite PMI index showed U.S. business activity approached the stagnation point in August, with growth at its weakest since February as demand for new business in the vast service sector contracted.</p>
      <p>Market participants' focus will be on a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole on Friday for additional clues about the path for interest rates.</p>
      <p>According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, the probability that the Fed leaves rates unchanged at its September meeting is now at 88.5%.</p>
      <p>Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>"People are expecting a continued hawkish tone from Chair Powell. It is too early for him to point to a loosening in policy on the horizon," said Daniel Ghali, commodity strategist at TD Securities.</p>
      <p>"The markets attention is now shifting from how high will rates go to how long will rates remain high."</p>
      <p>Spot silver gained 4.1% to $24.34 an ounce and platinum added 1.4% to $931.65. Palladium was up 0.9% at $1,273.53.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose for a third day as signs the physical market is tightening offset growing demand risks in China and the US.</p>
    	<p>Global benchmark Brent traded above $85 a barrel and is up more than 2% since last Wednesday’s close. The most immediate parts of the oil futures curve are pointing to tight supplies as curbs from OPEC+ linchpins Russia and Saudi Arabia help propel crude prices higher.</p>	
    	<p>There was also some support from wider markets, with European equities trading higher. US futures also pointed to a firmer open after a rough August so far for investors.</p>	
    	<p>Economic malaise in China — ranging from downbeat consumers to struggling exports — and stubbornly persistent inflation risks in the US saw oil fall last week, bucking a recent strong run. Chinese banks made a smaller-than-expected cut to their benchmark lending rate Monday and avoided trimming the reference rate for mortgages, despite the central bank putting pressure on lenders to boost loans.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some refined products such as diesel — the workhorse fuel of the global economy — have started pricing in scarcity this winter, boosting their premium to the oil from which they are made. Gasoline futures in New York have risen by 15% this year, also outpacing crude.</p>
      <p>“The Chinese growth outlook is causing demand concerns while the crude oil market, including various product markets, remains exceptionally tight,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmusen, head of research at A/S Global Risk Management. “The increased backwardation indicates that the spot market is tight.”</p>
      <p>The annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, which features speakers including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, may provide clues on the direction of interest rates. More increases in borrowing costs may be coming in the US after minutes of the Fed’s July meeting showed officials remained concerned about the inflationary threat.</p>

    	<p>The largest gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Shares GLD is up 3.4% this year against the Gold Miners Equity ETF GDX’s 3.7% losses. The fund GLD has lost 3.6% in the past three months (as of Aug 18, 2023) against 13.4% losses seen in the miners ETF GDX. In this article, we’ll tell you why bullion ETFs are currently better bets than miners, if you at all want to play the gold space.</p>
    	<h3>Inside the Opportunities and Weakness of Gold Bullion Investments</h3>
      <p>Inflation has significantly reduced from its 40-year peak in mid-2022. Hence, a less-hawkish Fed this year has provided much-needed support to gold bullion prices. Gold prices tend to move inversely to interest rates. When interest rates decline, non-interest-bearing gold becomes more attractive as it competes more favorably with interest-bearing investments like bonds.</p>	
    	<p>Physical demand for gold remains robust, fueled by central bank purchases and consumer demand. Central banks from emerging markets continue to diversify their reserves by acquiring gold, reflecting their confidence in the metal's enduring value.</p>	
    	<p>The metal is seen as a safe-haven assets. With the U.S. banking sector struggling with potential rating downgrades and the likely contagion from China’s ailing real estate sector, we may see a broad-based crash in the market. If this happens, gold bullion may gain in value due to risk-off trade sentiments.</p>
      <p>However, inflation remains considerably above the Fed's desired 2% level. The Fed members see further upside risks to inflation, which may cause further rate hikes. This may result in higher treasury yields and increased strength of the greenback, which will go against the greenback.</p>
      <p>Invesco DB Precious Metals Fund DBP and abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF SGOL have lost 1.1% and 1.2% last week, respectively.</p>
      <h3>Inside the Pain of Miners</h3>
      <p>High oil prices are negatives. Mining companies’ 50% of production costs are closely linked to energy prices. After a moderate rally this year, crude prices have been hovering around $80-level. The WTI crude ETF USO has added 13.7% in the past three months. This should cause trouble for gold miners’ operating margins.</p>
      <p>Earnings have been mixed-to-downbeat. Newmont Corporation NEM reported adjusted earnings were 33 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The company’s revenues of $2,683 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,870.1 million. Barrick Gold Corporation GOLD came up with mixed results. While adjusted earnings beat expectations, revenues missed the same.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>By Chen Aizhu, Emily Chow and Marwa Rashad</p>
    	<p>SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - China's liquefied natural (LNG) gas importers are starting up or expanding trading desks in London and Singapore to better manage their growing and diversified supply portfolios in an increasingly volatile global market.</p>	
    	<p>The beefed-up trading presence of Chinese importers puts them in direct competition with such global heavyweights as Shell, BP, Equinor and TotalEnergies for a market that the International Energy Agency says doubled in value to $450 billion last year.</p>	
    	<p>About a dozen Chinese companies have been expanding trading teams or adding new desks, with privately run ENN Natural Gas and state-run China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) the latest to plan London offices, and utility China Gas Holdings setting up a Singapore operation, company officials and traders said.</p>
      <p>Chinese gas importers have also boosted long-term LNG contracts with Qatar and U.S. suppliers by nearly 50% since late 2022 to more than 40 million metric tons per year (mtpy), with plans to add more volumes from those two countries, as well as from Oman, Canada and Mozambique, traders and analysts said.</p>
    	<p>"We're going to see a paradigm shift in Chinese companies from being total net importers to (being) more international and domestic trading players," said Toby Copson, Shanghai-based head of global trading for Trident LNG.</p>	
    	<p>Already, state-run PetroChina, Sinopec, Sinochem Group and CNOOC are actively trading volatility to capitalise on their long portfolios, Copson said.</p>	
    	<p>China vies with Japan to be the world's largest LNG importer, although it's not clear how much surplus or other volumes Chinese companies might have available to trade.</p>
      <p>PetroChina International (PCI), trading arm of PetroChina and China's largest gas trader with a 100-strong global team in Beijing and four other international offices, imported or traded about 30 million tons of LNG last year.</p>
    	<p>Zhang Yaoyu, PCI's global head of LNG trading, declined to comment on the company's traded volume, but said trading was part of the company's overall strategy.</p>	
    	<p>"Supply security is still at the heart of our business activities. Trading capability is one of the enablers ... to help us better deal with market swings," Zhang said.</p>	
    	<p>By 2026, Chinese companies are expected to have contracted LNG supplies of more than 100 million tons a year. That could mean a surplus of up to 8 million tons that year, according to consultancy Poten & Partners, or a deficit of 5 million to 6 million tons based on estimates from pricing agency ICIS.</p>
      <p>Either way, China's growing domestic output and more piped gas from Central Asia and Russia provide enough of a fuel base that Chinese gas companies can trade or swap U.S. and other portfolio cargoes when arbitrages open or it makes market sense.</p>
    	<p>"I could see China becoming a seasonal seller to places like Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan, as well as into Europe," said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at Poten & Partners.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. LNG contracts are done on a free-on-board (FOB), open basis with no restrictions on destination, and consultant Rystad Energy estimates U.S. volume will make up a quarter of China's long-term contracts by 2030.</p>	
    	<p>Qatar, which will be China's largest supplier for 2026, however, offers traditional LNG contracts that are restricted to a single destination or country.</p>
      <p>BIG PUSH IN A SHIFTING MARKET</p>
    	<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year forced European buyers to raise LNG imports by two-thirds to replace lost Russian piped gas. This created an outlet for companies with available supplies, and Chinese, Japanese and South Korean companies pounced as global LNG prices surged and the value of the market doubled.</p>	
    	<p>European users have also been reluctant to sign long-term contracts because of decarbonisation goals, and Asian gas traders and importers have been sending LNG to Europe during spring and summer to fill storage tanks there, Feer said.</p>	
    	<p>PCI as well signed a deal in May to use Rotterdam's Gate regasification terminal for 20 years, a first for a Chinese company in Europe.</p>
      <p>These openings in the market and a more liberalised domestic gas market have also prompted smaller Chinese gas distributors and importers to expand into the trading space.</p>	
    	<p>China Gas Holdings, for instance, which has signed contracts for 3.7 million tons per year for U.S. LNG, is hiring its first two traders for a new office in Singapore and is looking to secure more contracts, a company executive told Reuters.</p>	
    	<p>It joins ENN, Beijing Gas, Zhejiang Energy and JOVO Energy in establishing a trading presence in the Southeast Asian energy hub.</p>
      <p>"Compared to Japanese firms, Chinese are way more aggressive in expansion, with PCI and Unipec among the best payers offering comparable packages as the global majors," as they look to fill out trading desks, said a Singapore-based recruiter.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- At any other time in history, the current state of the global diesel market would have sent some countries into a panic.</p>
    	<p>All over the world, prices for the fuel are sky-high relative to the crude oil from which it is made, pointing to a scarcity that should alarm inflation-obsessed governments everywhere. And within just a few months, the Northern Hemisphere will enter winter, pushing up demand for heating.</p>	
    	<p>The good news is that the market looked even worse this time last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and prices ultimately came down, helped by a relatively mild winter. However, today’s shriveled stockpiles mean the world can ill afford any bullish market surprises: supply curbs can arise at any time, or demand shocks can come from cold weather or surprisingly strong economies.</p>	
    	<p>“We should be building stocks now as they usually begin drawing seasonally from September,” said Eugene Lindell, head of refined products at industry consultant FGE. “There is a worry that stocks will not build sufficiently before October, and we will then start seeing draws from what threatens to be a low base.”</p>
      <p>The crux of the diesel supply concerns now lies in Europe and the US Atlantic Coast, he added.</p>
      <p>Oil markets have been rocked by soaring fuelmaking margins in recent weeks, with refinery curbs shrinking global supplies at a time when crude producers including Saudi Arabia are keeping barrels off the market.</p>
      <p>Lean Inventories</p>
      <p>Stockpiles of diesel-type fuel in northwest Europe are set to fall in coming months, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie Ltd. While that’s typical for the time of year, inventories are currently lower than historical norms — though still up year-on-year.</p>
      <p>“The outlook for Europe diesel/gasoil supply is tight in our current forecast, driven by the lower diesel/gasoil yields expected from lighter crude slates, the shift to jet yields, and unplanned refinery outages,” said Emma Howsham, a research analyst for refining and oil product markets at Wood Mackenzie. “Demand is expected to increase month-on-month to November.”</p>
      <p>A switch to less dense crude — a function of cuts by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others — has led to OECD Europe’s yields of diesel-type fuel being more than 1.6% lower in July compared with the historic average, she said.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the existing supply crunch, markets are closely watching China as its refiners await a fresh round of fuel export quotas from the government, which will allow them to keep shipping fuels. While ample Chinese flows could help to ease the current tightness, there’s a possibility they could offer thin relief this time.</p>
      <p>It’s unlikely there’ll be a surge in Chinese diesel shipments, even after the quotas have been issued, said Jianan Sun, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects. China’s domestic diesel demand has “surprised to the upside” with higher than expected infrastructure spending offsetting losses from the property market, he added. As a result, stockpiles failed to build even during seasons of weaker demand, said Sun.</p>
      <p>In the US, retail diesel prices have risen consistently since late July, so much so that it contributed more to inflation than gasoline in August. American refiners haven’t been able to build up inventories this summer, the typical period for supply growth in between crop seasons and ahead of winter heating. That’s because market conditions have made stockpiling a losing venture, similar to last year.</p>
      <p>New England’s main supplier, East Canada’s Irving refinery, will undergo major maintenance work lasting seven weeks starting September. This leaves the region out of reach for pipelines, at the mercy of seaborne shipments from further afield.</p>
      <p>Bullish Bets</p>
      <p>The diesel market’s performance is important beyond the universe of a few specialist traders.</p>
      <p>In its broadest definition, this type of fuel — which has varying specifications and is used in everything from cars and ships to heating and heavy machinery — is the single biggest chunk of petroleum product demand.</p>
      <p>Hedge funds are lifting their bullish bets, with net-long positions on ICE gasoil rose to the highest since March 2022 last week. Net-long positions on Nymex diesel also jumped to an 18-month high earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, it’s a vital fuel for the world’s supply chains, and major shortages and price shocks can have implications for governments and industries.</p>
      <p>Last year, high diesel prices spurred trucker strikes across Asia, pressuring governments trying to stave off inflation from rising energy costs. In the US, farmers and trucking companies that purchase in bulk stand to hurt even more from the rising costs.</p>
      <p>The current crunch highlights a dilemma that nations have in phasing out oil refineries as they try to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>Recent heatwaves have capped refinery output and impacted a global system that’s still coping with the halting of several plants in recent years, said FGE’s Lindell.</p>

    	<p>By Sudarshan Varadhan</p>
    	<p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Oil prices looked set to snap a seven-week winning streak on Friday as concerns about China's slowing economic growth and the possibility of more U.S. interest rate hikes outweighed signs of tightening supply.</p>	
    	<p>Major benchmarks were slightly higher on Friday, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) rising 22 cents, or 0.3%, to $80.61 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 8 cents, or 0.1%, at $84.12 a barrel as of 0611 GMT.</p>	
    	<p>The seven-week winning streak was the longest for both benchmarks this year. Brent futures rose by about 18% and WTI by more than 20% in the seven weeks ended Aug. 11 to the highest levels in months before paring some gains this week, when both fell by more than 3%.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve's focus on containing inflation amid stronger-than-expected economic data was keeping a lid on oil prices, which have risen sharply in the recent weeks due to concerns over supply.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Labor Department on Thursday reported the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell in the last week, suggesting the still-tight employment market could prolong the Fed's tightening campaign to cool the economy.</p>
      <p>That report followed similarly upbeat economic data earlier in the week, including U.S. retail sales, which suggested the Fed may have to stick with higher rates for longer.</p>
      <p>Investors fret that higher borrowing costs could impede economic growth and in turn reduce overall demand, including for oil.</p>
      <p>Adding to the concerns, a recent batch of economic data from China, the world's second largest oil consumer, has highlighted a rapid loss of economic momentum since the second quarter.</p>
      <p>China's sputtering economy has whipsawed global financial markets in the past few months, with a property crisis spooking investors amid contagion fears.</p>
      <p>However, tightening oil supply due to production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting countries and allies, together called OPEC+, and increasing demand, mainly due to higher travel and improved industrial activity in the U.S., has supported prices, and could lead to a rise in the coming days, analysts said.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil production was offsetting some losses in output due to OPEC+ cuts, but the falling U.S. rig count meant such support could likely be short-lived, ANZ Research said in a report on Friday.</p>
      <p>Data released this week also showed that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates. Weekly products supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to the highest since December. [EIA/S].</p>
      <p>Despite recent economic weaknesses, China made a rare draw on crude oil inventories in July, the first time in 33 months it has dipped into storage.</p>
      <p>"Momentum indicators are showing supply tightness. Investors have started increasing their bullish bets, net-long positions are reaching an annual high," ANZ said in its report.</p>

    	<p>Oil is poised to rally beyond $90 per barrel by the end of the year amid record demand and tightening supply, according to UBS strategists.</p>
    	<p>"We still see scope for global oil prices to rally,” said a recent UBS note to investors. “We now expect Brent to hit USD 95/bbl and the US WTI benchmark to rise to USD 91/bbl by end-December, up from the current USD 90/bbl and USD 85/bbl, respectively."</p>	
    	<p>Brent International (BZ=F) prices stand just below $85 per barrel, about 3% off year-to-date highs reached earlier in August. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) is hovering above $80 per barrel.</p>	
    	<p>Concerns over China’s economy, the world’s second-largest consumer of crude, recently has put pressure on crude futures. Data released Tuesday by China's National Bureau of Statistics added to concerns of a sluggish recovery as Beijing unexpectedly cut policy rates and withheld information on youth unemployment.</p>
      <p>"Some investors remain skeptical that China’s latest stimulus efforts—a 15- basis-point cut to its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) and a 10bps cut to the short-term 7-day reverse repo rate—will be sufficient to revive demand," the UBS note said. "China is the world’s largest oil importer, the second-largest consumer, and the seventh-largest producer."</p>
      <p>However, UBS strategists don’t expect the price slide to persist amid firming fundamentals. Those include declining inventories and tight supply as OPEC+ production nears a two year low.</p>
      <p>OPEC+ has been cutting production since October of last year. Saudi Arabia recently extended its one million barrel-per-day output reduction into September, while Russia announced it will slash oil exports.</p>
      <p>“We expect global oil demand to hit a record high in August,” the note said.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs analysts recently reaffirmed their forecast of $93 per barrel for Brent crude and $86 per barrel for WTI by December, highlighting the market is less "pessimistic" about the global economy.</p>

    	<p>The Saudis may sugar coat a production cut as providing stability for the market, but here's what they fail to realize.</p>
    	<p>Brent oil prices have rallied a good $15 per barrel from the lows in July. The highs reached last week around $87 per barrel. It seems the OPEC+ council cannot withstand prices below $70, and hence decided to intervene, activating the OPEC put. Of course, the OPEC put, which is really the Saudi put, has no regard for the consequences of higher-for-longer oil prices -- as long as it maximizes its chances of receiving higher revenues for their oil production. Now, the Fed has to be quite mindful of activating the "Fed put," as the wrong timing can cause much dire consequences. As much as Saudi Arabia may sugar coat the cut as providing stability for the market, it is trying to protect a floor so to speak. But what they fail to realize is how their actions influence the entire world and the Fed put, as well.</p>	
    	<p>During the summer, Saudi Arabia has a higher power burn, so it suits them to cut production now and pump more domestically. But it has extended its one-million-barrel-per day cut through the end of September, with the goal, or hope rather, that when Chinese demand returns, the world will be tighter than normal, causing prices to rally abnormally.</p>	
    	<p>They are buying time hoping the eventual rebound in the fourth quarter will take over the job for them. But something more sinister is at work, and perhaps that's why OPEC should look past what economists tell them as they never get the cycle right in the first place. They may have succeeded in temporarily getting oil prices much higher, but the rest of the world is going through a very harsh slowdown that is yet to be felt in asset prices. China is imploding as it has a battle to either quell the disinflationary momentum or support the yuan. The currency is now trading at the lowest since 2015 vs. the dollar, but they are limited as to what it can do as its only hope is to boost the domestic consumer who is not willing to buy another home or another car. Latest Chinese data shows exports slowing down, which it needs to keep its debt fuel bubble going. Its property developers are defaulting on loans that are being offset by shadow banks; this entire Ponzi scheme is finally coming to light as it does not work if the second-hand home market is not on a constant uptrend. They tried to pump money in the economy in the first half of the year, that rally and growth fizzled out. China is not operating in a silo as it needs western world and their demand to chase their products.</p>
      <p>The Fed has been fighting this battle to get inflation down, a mandate it will not give up on. But the longer oil prices stay higher, it defeats their purpose. This also means that it cannot cut rates when the time comes as inflation will be out of the box again, and then it will be too late. Saudi Arabia may think it is being extremely clever in tweaking the market to keep it up higher for longer, but this is making matters worse. They have cut their Arab light production, which tends to influence many refiners decision as to how much gas oil to produce. The lower gas oil production is causing havoc in the physical markets as gasoline refining margins are sky rocketing. A lot of refineries need light oil to produce products and not heavy oil. So, Saudis are playing a very cheeky game.</p>
      <p>The problem is demand, not supply. And as much as one would like to keep prices propped up, if the demand rebound never comes, that price rally is futile. A recession will take all prices lower, despite the Saudi put. As each day goes by, the illusion of the Chinese and global demand recovery remains elusive, as the global economy is pushed into a harsh slowdown. OPEC may just be delaying the inevitable, but eventually commodities succumb to the global pressures, especially when the natural floor is nowhere to be seen around these levels.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil declined in a volatile session where sentiment was being driven by renewed worries surrounding China’s property sector.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate fell near $82. Global markets were pressured on concerns around the debt of some Chinese developers, though there was some respite as one, Country Garden Holdings Co., is seeking to extend a maturing bond for the first time. China’s offshore yuan weakened and the dollar climbed, making commodities priced in the currency less appealing.</p>	
    	<p>Crude has risen by about a quarter since its lows in June as OPEC+ linchpins Russia and Saudi Arabia curtailed supply. That’s helped push the market into a deficit of more than 2 million barrels a day this quarter, the producer group has estimated. Rising risks to flows of Russian crude through the Black Sea due to the war in Ukraine have also aided the gains.</p>	
    	<p>At the same time, the outlook in the US has brightened as a growing number of economists — including the Federal Reserve’s own staff — now predict the country will escape a recession, which could buoy energy demand.</p>
      <p>“Crude oil prices are pulling back this morning on China concerns,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB AB. “But Saudi Arabia is probably very happy with the overall situation. It has showed the oil market yet again who’s boss and the world will also need more of its oil in the coming months.”</p>
      <p>A snapshot of conditions in China will come on Tuesday with industrial-production figures, including for the refining industry. The country, the world’s largest crude buyer, has been opening new plants, buoying import demand.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- A year ago this week, US President Joe Biden signed into law the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into efforts to respond to the climate crisis and boost the nation’s reliance on clean energy. This year, the world has seen devastating wildfires, extreme weather and war combine to further destabilize food and energy markets and push power grids to their limits.</p>
    	<p>Here are five notable charts — actually, one is a map — to consider in global commodity markets as the week gets underway.</p>	
    	<h3>Emissions</h3>	
    	<p>Wednesday marks the anniversary of the climate law that has channeled upwards of $370 billion into clean-energy initiatives as the US aims to reduce its carbon footprint. Under current policies, the country is set to drive emissions of harmful greenhouse gases to 32%-51% below 2005 levels in 2035, according to an annual analysis by Rhodium Group. By 2030, the US is on track to achieve a 29%-42% reduction — a notable improvement from previous forecasts, but not enough to meet its pledge under the Paris Agreement, the group’s data show. This puts greater emphasis on additional policies by states and local governments, as well as the private sector, to help achieve the ambitious targets.</p>
      <h3>Climate</h3>
    	<p>July was officially Earth’s hottest month on record, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. In the US, four states — Arizona, Florida, Maine and New Mexico — set fresh records last month, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released Aug. 8 show. With blistering heat prevailing again this month, power grids — as well as crops like wheat, corn and soybeans — will most certainly continue to come under pressure. Biden recently said the extreme heat is costing the US $100 billion a year.</p>	
    	<h3>Agriculture</h3>
      <p>The combination of India’s decision to ban a large portion of its rice exports and the increasing threat of an El Niño weather pattern on harvests in key producers has sent prices of the grain surging. Benchmark Thai white rice jumped to $648 a ton last week and is on course for the biggest monthly advance since January 2018, threatening the availability of a food staple for billions in Asia and Africa. With robust demand and shrinking supplies ahead, rice’s rampant rally looks set to continue.</p>
      <h3>Oil</h3>	
    	<p>US oil production is set to grow faster than previously forecast, according to the latest government data. That’s welcome relief to a market that has tightened in the wake of Saudi Arabia’s output cuts, which are set to extend at least into September, and those of Russia. And despite growing evidence of a warming planet, global oil demand has never been stronger. World consumption averaged 103 million barrels a day for the first time in June amid robust Chinese demand, strong summer air travel and increased use in power generation, the International Energy Agency said Friday. That should support further price gains in the months ahead. Both West Texas Intermediate and Brent futures — the global benchmark — edged lower Monday after coming off their seventh straight weekly advance.</p>
      <h3>Natural Gas</h3>
      <p>Traders will be focused on whether strikes materialize at three major liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia, which threaten to disrupt about 10% of global LNG exports. While Europe rarely receives LNG from Australia, the potential shortage will impact Asia buyers, who would need to compete with the continent for replacement cargoes. Even though Europe has built up much higher inventories than usual for the time of year — and sources its LNG from a wide variety of suppliers — benchmark natural gas prices surged last week by the most since June as concerns re-emerged over the continent’s ability to secure enough supplies ahead of winter should a squeeze emerge in Asia. Prices edged lower on Monday.</p>

    	<p>Gold is considered one of the biggest safe haven assets. In 2022, the international demand for gold was around 3,303 metric tons which shows a significant improvement from 2020 when the pandemic triggered a drop in gold demand to 2,301 metric tons, the lowest since 2010. China and India are the countries with the highest gold consumption as of 2022.</p>	
    	<p>Despite being considered an inflation hedge, gold has shown a high amount of volatility. One of the main reasons is that interest rate hikes have an adverse effect on the prices of precious metals. However, 2023 has been a good year for gold and its per-ounce price rose by 5.4% in the first half of 2023, closing at $1,912.25 per ounce in June. We can see that the gold rates are rising even with the rising interest rates which usually isn’t the case for precious metals. This can be attributed to the fact that investments in gold are considered to be more secure and safe during economic crises. At the time of writing on August 2, per ounce gold price closed at $1934.50.</p>	
    	<p>According to an Invesco survey of the central bank and sovereign wealth funds, several countries are retrieving their gold stored outside of their countries in light of sanctions imposed by the West on Russia. Around 60% of the survey participants believe gold to be more attractive and 68% of the participants were keeping reserves in their country, up from 50% in 2020.</p>
      <h3>Industry Outlook</h3>
      <p>At the end of June, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England increased interest rates, while the US Federal Reserve took a break from the hike only to raise it by 25 bps in July. Experts believe that the hikes are nearing an end which bears good news for precious metals, including gold and silver.</p>	
    	<p>Nevertheless, the recession fears have slightly eased but still aren’t over and during these times gold’s intrinsic value is much more attractive than other investments such as stocks and bonds. While all other stocks and bonds become a little unappealing, gold stocks can be expected to do well due to the rising demand for yellow metal.</p>
      <p>Moreover, companies like Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU) and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) seem quite positive about their H2 2023 performance in terms of revenue and production. At its Q2 2023 earnings call, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)’s Chief Executive Officer, Tom Palmer said:</p>	
    	<p>“As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tonnes mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tonnes mined Cerro Negro is the first wave of our district expansion which comes online in the third quarter. Higher tonnes mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter.”</p>

      <p>“Precious Metals Royalty basket (Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), SSL, TFPM): In the current macroeconomic environment, there are many ways to ‘win’ with gold. It is remarkable that even with record positive real yields, gold is flirting with all time highs. Why? Western central banks are increasing interest rates which means that they will have to pay more interest on the record levels of debt that their government’s owe. Where will the money come from to pay the higher interest expense? The answer is simple – more debt and more money printing! We believe the gold knows this! We believe that precious metals will protect real purchasing power and act as a hedge to the portfolio when macroeconomic uncertainty arises. Owning royalty companies at reasonable valuations gives us a high quality exposure to precious metals without project or cost inflation risks inherent in a mining company.”</p>

    	<p>By Natalie Grover</p>
    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices slipped about 1% on Monday as concerns about China's faltering economic recovery and a stronger dollar, after seven weeks of gains driven by tightening supply from OPEC+ cuts.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures slipped 93 cents, or about 1.1% to $86.46 a barrel by 1237 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.03, or roughly 1.2%, to $82.81 a barrel.</p>	
    	<p>"Crude has been in overbought territory for some time now, defying expectations of a correction. It has been singularly focused on U.S. economic optimism, to the exclusion of the increasingly stronger headwinds blowing in the eurozone and China," said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.</p>
      <p>"A rebalancing is overdue but it may need a reality check in the markets stateside," she said.</p>	
    	<p>China's sluggish economic recovery and a stronger U.S. dollar could depress prices, but OPEC+ has indicated it would do whatever it takes to tighten supply and stabilise markets, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said.</p>	
    	<p>The U.S. dollar index extended gains after a slightly bigger increase in U.S. producer prices in July lifted Treasury yields despite expectations the Federal Reserve is at the end of hiking interest rates. [FRX/]</p>
      <p>A stronger dollar pressures oil demand by making the commodity more expensive for buyers holding other currencies.</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, part of the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, or OPEC+, are expected to erode oil inventories over the rest of this year, potentially driving prices even higher, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly report on Friday.</p>	
    	<p>Last week’s encouraging demand estimates, falling OPEC supply, declining inventories and mitigated inflationary pressure, said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM, "is a warning signal that unless China joins the party the path upwards will be paved with pitfalls".</p>
      <p>Separately on Monday, a Shell spokesperson said exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil resumed on Sunday, roughly a month after loadings of the medium sweet grade were suspended because of a potential leak at the export terminal.</p>
      <p>The suspension of Forcados loadings contributed to Nigeria becoming the second-biggest contributor to the drop in OPEC crude oil output in July, a Reuters survey showed.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>After falling this year, Devon Energy's dividend appears poised to rebound in the coming quarters.</p>
    	<p>Devon Energy's (DVN -0.69%) innovative dividend has been on a steep downward trend over the past year. After peaking at $1.55 per share following last year's second quarter, the company's combined fixed-plus-variable dividend payment has declined for four straight quarters. It will only be $0.49 per share following this year's second quarter.</p>	
	    <p>However, better days appear to be ahead for Devon Energy's dividend. A trio of catalysts could give the oil stock the fuel to pay higher dividends in 2024.</p>	
    	<h3>Oil prices are rebounding (and could continue rallying)</h3>
      <p>Devon Energy sold its oil at an average price of $71.74 per barrel during the second quarter. That's down from an average of $95.80 per barrel in the year-ago period. The more than 25% decline in crude prices put downward pressure on Devon's cash flow, which fuels its variable dividend.</p>
      <p>However, crude oil prices have rebounded over the last few weeks. WTI, the primary U.S. oil benchmark price, has risen more than 8% in the past month and was recently around $83 per barrel. The big driver has been continued healthy demand and extra production cuts by OPEC.</p>
      <p>Those two factors could continue pushing crude prices higher. Analysts expect that there will be a wide gap between global supplies and demand over the next few months, which will enable the economy to burn off excess inventory. Many oil market forecasters believe this could push oil prices up over $90 a barrel by early next year. Higher oil prices would provide a lift to Devon Energy's cash flow.</p>
      <h3>Growing oil production</h3>
      <p>Devon Energy is putting itself in an even better position to capitalize on higher crude prices by growing its production. The company's oil production reached an all-time high of 323,000 barrels per day (BPD) during the second quarter, an 8% increase from the year-ago period. It benefited from recent acquisitions and newly drilled wells in the oil-rich Delaware Basin.</p>
      <p>The oil company expects its crude output to continue rising. It sees production increasing to as much as 330,000 BPD in the third quarter, fueled by recently completed wells. The company's oil production should continue rising in the coming quarters as it drills and completes additional wells. Higher oil production will grow its cash flow, especially if prices continue to rise.</p>
      <h3>Cost inflation is moderating</h3>
      <p>Falling oil prices weren't the only headwind impacting Devon Energy's free cash flow this year. The company also took a hit from higher costs as inflation drove up oilfield service prices, increasing capital expenses.</p>
      <p>However, those headwinds are starting to fade. CEO Rick Muncrief commented on this trend on the second-quarter conference call. He stated:</p>
      <p><strong>Our business is also beginning to benefit from service cost deflation as contracts are refreshed. This is driven by reduced activity from natural gas-focused companies and private producers over the past few months, resulting in improved availability of services and cost deflation in virtually every category.</strong></p>
      <p>The CEO expects these deflationary trends to continue. That will provide meaningful savings, which will flow through over the next year. The company expects to maintain its cost discipline, enabling those savings to accrue to investors through higher free cash flow, the bulk of which it will return to shareholders through variable dividends and share repurchases.</p>
      <h3>Setting up for a strong year in 2024</h3>
      <p>While it's still early, Devon Energy appears poised to produce more free cash flow next year, fueled by higher oil prices, increased oil production, and cost deflation. That will give it more money to pay variable dividends, given its framework of paying out 50% of its free cash each quarter. These catalysts make now seem like a compelling time to buy shares of Devon Energy to potentially cash in on a higher dividend next year.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil was on track to end the week little changed, after touching the highest since November in recent days, as the International Energy Agency’s monthly snapshot pointed to a robust market.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate futures traded near $83 a barrel, virtually flat on the week. Global oil demand has surged to a record thanks to robust Chinese consumption, the IEA said. It followed a report from OPEC that suggested a sharp supply deficit of more than 2 million barrels a day this quarter.</p>	
    	<p>Oil has rallied since late-June on cuts from Saudi Arabia, aided by export curbs from OPEC+ ally Russia. Traders are also continuing to monitor the wider economic outlook, as the impact of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle continues to ripple through markets.</p>
      <p>Iran has moved four US citizens from prison to house arrest, the first step of an emerging deal between Washington and Tehran that could eventually see more barrels from the OPEC producer hitting the market.</p>
      <p>“What we anticipate is the acceleration of the trend of de minimis sanctions enforcement to enable Iranian barrels to reach the Asian market,” RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft wrote in a note. “Nonetheless there remain important spoilers to watch. Congress may seek to upend this informal reset and try to mandate the enforcement of existing punitive measures.”</p>	
    	<p>The tightness is flowing through to downstream fuel markets, with a type of petroleum left over from oil refining costing more than crude in Europe for the first time in decades. Prices of gasoline and diesel are also well above seasonal norms, partly as a result of refinery output curbs.</p>

    	<p>By Swati Verma</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices held near one-month lows on Friday, shrugging off cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation figures for last month, with bullion staying on course to wrap up its worst week in seven as the U.S. dollar and bond yields stood strong.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold edged 0.2% higher to $1,916.53 per ounce by 0727 GMT, but traded near its lowest level since July 7 touched earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,948.80.</p>	
    	<p>Gold gained as much as 0.8% on Thursday after data showed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) climbed less than expected in July, raising bets that the Fed will unlikely hike interest rates again in 2023.</p>
      <p>Interest rate increases tend to lift bond yields and in turn raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>"Once the CPI dust had settled, markets seemed to remember that core CPI at 4.7% is still not great – even if it was slower than expected," said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at City Index, adding that gold's move higher lacked conviction.</p>
      <p>"We also had Fed member Mary Daly putting a fly in the dovish ointment, saying whether another hold or hike at the Fed's next meeting is 'yet to be determined'. And that saw the U.S. dollar regain its strength."</p>
      <p>Gold prices have slid about 1.3% so far in the week as the U.S. dollar index and benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields were on track for their fourth consecutive weekly gain. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>Moderating inflation and strong labour data present an ideal macroeconomic balance, pushing out the possibility of a hard landing, which diminishes safe-haven flows for gold and also supports a higher-for-longer rates scenario, ANZ analysts wrote in a note.</p>
      <p>Spot silver rose 0.2% to $22.72 an ounce and platinum added 0.6% to $912.04. Still, both were on track for their fourth straight weekly loss.</p>
      <p>Palladium was up 0.3% at $1,290.43, eyeing its best week since mid-June.</p>

    	<p>By Ahmad Ghaddar</p>
    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices held near recent highs on Friday amid optimistic demand forecasts from the OPEC producer group and the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude was down 12 cents, or 0.1%, at $86.28 a barrel at 0910 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 7 cents, or 0.1%, at $82.75.</p>	
    	<p>Both benchmarks have been on a sustained rally since June, with WTI trading on Thursday at its highest this year and Brent hitting its highest since late January.</p>
      <p>The IEA on Friday warned that global inventories could fall sharply over the rest of 2023, potentially driving prices even higher, though the agency expects demand growth to slow to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, down 150,000 bpd from its previous forecast.</p>
      <p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Thursday said it expects global oil demand to rise by 2.25 million bpd in 2024, compared with growth of 2.44 million bpd this year. Both forecasts were unchanged from last month.</p>
      <p>In 2024 "solid" economic growth amid continued improvements in China is expected to boost oil consumption, it added.</p>
      <p>"Demand is reassuringly upbeat," PVM oil analyst Tamas Varga said. "These cheerful projections suggest that OPEC is sanguine on global economic prospects."</p>
      <p>Market sentiment was also lifted by Thursday's U.S. consumer prices data for July, which fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its aggressive rate hike cycle.</p>
      <p>On the supply side, prices have been supported by extensions to output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia alongside supply fears driven by the potential for conflict between Russia and Ukraine to disrupt Russian oil shipments in the Black Sea region.</p>
      <p>Mixed economic data from China weighed on sentiment, however.</p>
      <p>While customs data showed crude imports up year on year, China's overall exports plunged 14.5%, with monthly crude imports retreating from June's near-record highs to the lowest level since January.</p>
      <p>Data this week also showed China's consumer prices fell into deflation and factory gate prices extended declines in July, raising concerns about fuel demand in the world's second-largest economy.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Gold has always been in demand, for both its beauty and its utility. It’s also often used as a diversification tool, or even as a speculative stand-alone investment. But its price is often hard to predict.</p>
    	<p>As a commodity, the price of gold doesn’t depend on earnings and revenue growth, as is the case with stocks. Rather, a multitude of outside forces, from interest rates to monetary policy to geopolitical events, can drive the price of gold up or down. But it can be hard for the individual investor to factor in all of these components on their own.</p>	
    	<p>To help out, JP Morgan recently came out with a bold prediction for the price of gold over the next 12 to 18 months, based on certain specific factors. Here’s what the famed investment house had to say.</p>	
    	<h3>JP Morgan’s Gold Prediction</h3>
      <p>According to a research note penned by Greg Shearer, executive director of global commodities research, gold will average $2,012 by the middle of next year and hit $2,175 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2024. This is up from a price of about $1,915 as of Aug. 9, 2023.</p>
      <p>If the market price reaches the $2,175 predicted by JP Morgan by Q4 2024, that would represent a gain of about 13.5%.</p>
      <h3>What Are the Reasons for the Call?</h3>
      <p>Shearer expects the Federal Reserve to completely reverse its policy of tightening interest rates in the very near future. According to his research note, he expects that the Fed will actually begin cutting rates by Q2 2024, with falling yields being a “significant driver” for gold.</p>
      <p>When interest rates drop, demand for gold typically rises. As investment firm PIMCO explains it, when yields are high, gold becomes less attractive because it doesn’t pay any income. But when interest rates fall, so too does the opportunity cost for owning gold.</p>
      <p>In other words, owning gold in a low-rate environment does force you to give up the high income you might earn from other investments in a high-yield environment. Thus, money tends to flow back into gold, as JP Morgan predicts for the upcoming 12-to-18 months.</p>
      <p>Shearer also notes that there is still the potential for a recession in the coming months. Recessionary environments tend to dampen interest rates even further, which in turn supports the case for owning gold. According to Shearer, the deeper any recession is, the higher gold prices are likely to go.</p>
      <p>In addition to the falling-interest-rate scenario, JP Morgan also sees support for gold in the form of institutional demand. According to the firm, central banks will likely continue to buy gold to diversify away from the U.S. dollar — which tends to fall along with interest rates — and to hedge against heightened geopolitical risks.</p>
      <h3>Should You Invest Now?</h3>
      <p>Investing in gold is not for everyone.</p>
      <p>For starters, it doesn’t cast off any income. Actual gold is also quite illiquid, although you can sidestep this by owning an exchange-traded fund tracking the price of gold instead.</p>
      <p>Lastly, gold prices can be notoriously fickle. Unlike stocks, which have actual businesses behind them generating revenue and earnings, gold is the ultimate supply-and-demand commodity. Investors typically use it more as a hedge than as a straight investment, and most financial advisors suggest that even the most bullish investors only devote 10% or less of their portfolios to commodities like gold.</p>
      <p>That being said, if you believe in JP Morgan’s analysis, gold might prove a good asset in terms of both diversification and appreciation over the next 12 to 18 months. Most economists believe that the Fed will indeed begin to cut interest rates sometime in 2024, and this forms the backdrop of JP Morgan’s argument.</p>
      <p>Of course, many economists also called for a recession in 2023, and thus far, the U.S. economy has proven surprisingly resilient. Falling interest rates might actually help prop up the economy and keep it out of recession, in which case JP Morgan’s argument for gold might be too bullish.</p>
      <p>As the future price of gold can’t be determined with any certainty, if you’re considering investing, consult with a financial advisor so you can discuss if gold is something that matches your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Also, consider limiting your gold investment to no more than 10% of your overall portfolio, even if you’re bullish on the precious metal.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- European natural gas declined Thursday as traders took stock of an extreme price swing in the previous session, fueled by the possibility of strikes in Australia that could disrupt supplies.</p>
    	<p>Benchmark futures settled 7% lower, erasing an earlier gain. The contract surged 28% on Wednesday, the most since March 2022.</p>	
    	<p>The abrupt change is the latest example of intense volatility that has stalked Europe’s gas market for months. Traders continue to be on edge even though the continent’s fuel inventories are about 88% full on average — well above normal for the time of year — and industrial demand remains tepid after last year’s energy crisis.</p>	
    	<p>Workers at some Chevron Corp. and Woodside Energy Group Ltd. facilities in Australia are considering industrial action, which could have implications for liquefied natural gas supplies. Talks are ongoing and further negotiations are scheduled for Aug. 15. Any prolonged strikes, which could begin as soon as next week, risk tightening the market for the fuel as buyers in Asia would have to seek alternative supplies.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Asian spot LNG price tracked earlier European price moves, rising 10% after a public holiday in Singapore on Wednesday, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.</p>
      <p>Any interruption at the Australian facilities risks disrupting about 10% of global LNG exports. If the dispute were to last one month, about 3 million tons of LNG capacity could be affected, removing about 44 cargoes of LNG from the market, according to Claudio Steuer, director or SyEnergy Consulting.</p>
      <p>However, the strikes — if they materialize — may only have a limited impact on physical shipments to Europe, he said. While some US supplies could shift to Asia, Europe also sources LNG via long-term contracts from Norway, Algeria, Qatar and Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Markets rise on speculation and fall on facts,” Steuer said. “Once the market realized the disruption may be much smaller and the market is adequately supplied at the moment,” European prices corrected.</p>
      <p>It’s also possible trader positioning contributed to the recent price surge.</p>
      <p>“The strength and extent of the move may have been driven by an unwinding of short positions, and the market has fallen back to some extent today as the dust settles,” said Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec. There was a similar move that drove prices higher in recent months, he added.</p>
      <p>Gas Inventories</p>
      <p>Still, traders are keeping a close eye on gas stockpiles and maintenance schedules. Total LNG inventories in Japan may have fallen below last year’s level due to more robust power demand, according to Rystad Energy. In China, LNG tank stockpiles at import terminals could hit 90% in the coming month, which could force importers to push back seaborne shipment deliveries.</p>
      <p>Europe’s LNG imports have already slipped from the highs seen earlier this year, while stockpiles continue to build. There’s also considerable focus on any potential changes to maintenance schedules in Norway, the region’s top producer.</p>
      <p>Dutch front-month futures, Europe’s gas benchmark, closed at €37.06 a megawatt-hour. The UK equivalent dropped 6.8%, also erasing an earlier gain.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- During periods of turmoil, gold tends to make headlines as fans of the precious metal argue it can act as a safe haven. But is it also an inflation hedge? Is it considered a risk asset?</p>
    	<p>Joe Cavatoni, market strategist and head of Americas at the World Gold Council, joined the What Goes Up podcast to discuss how gold has been performing this year and what some of its primary price catalysts are.</p>	
    	<p>Here are some highlights of the conversation, which have been condensed and edited for clarity. Click here to listen to the full podcast, or subscribe on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen.</p>	
    	<p>Listen to What Goes Up on Apple Podcasts</p>
      <p>Listen to What Goes Up on Spotify</p>
    	<p>Q: The explanation of what’s driving gold prices is a moving target. Help us think about what drives the price of gold up or down.</p>	
    	<p>A: As an asset, it’s very unique because when you think about the strategic drivers of gold and how gold is consumed worldwide, it’s consumed in the consumption way, which is through jewelry, small bars and coins, maybe in technology like your iPhone, where it’s a component. And those types of consumption behaviors are driven strategically through economic expansion — simply put, you get wealthier, you feel comfortable about buying jewelry or you buy more technology, and you actually see economic expansion putting money in pockets and people actually using that to invest in things, including gold.</p>	
    	<p>Q: Is that the primary driver?</p>
      <p>It is, but I’m going to come back around and talk about the big markets like China and India, where there’s a bit of a mix — because it is consumer, but there’s also an element of savings there. And then secondly, you look at the investment side. So when market risk and uncertainty develops, higher levels of volatility, confusion around what’s going to play out for the next period of time — whether it’s one month, one year, whatever the case may be — long term, which is how we often make sure people understand that’s how you need to view gold, the market risk and uncertainty is benefited when gold is added to your portfolio, because in that context, investors see the type of diversification benefit you get from gold in your portfolio as helpful. So it correlates positively when the S&P 500 goes up, and it correlates negative when the S&P goes down. So you’ve got those two strategic drivers.</p>
    	<p>Adding to that, you’ve got a global asset. So it’s not just something bought here in the US but it’s bought and sold all over the world. China and India are two huge markets from a consumption perspective. And in addition to that, this asset is actually produced and supplied on a global scale as well. So you’ve got a global element, you’ve got a regional element, you’ve got a consumer behavior, you’ve got an investment behavior.</p>	
    	<p>Q: What has the price of gold done this year, and how do factors like monetary policy impact prices?</p>	
    	<p>A: This year, what we’ve seen are two things. Number one, monetary policy continuing to be a headwind. The opportunity cost, the rotation of assets in a portfolio, risk-asset behavior, how people are dealing with their risk assets, that’s a moment where we see headwinds for gold. People don’t look to gold in those moments when movement in rates and movement in those risk assets is taking place. Once people have made their allocation, they come back around to gold and they put in their portfolio that ballast of a holding — 3%, 5%, 10% of their portfolio. So the price behavior this year has seen a lot of that.</p>
      <p>But within the course of the year, we’ve also seen systemic events or moments that have kicked into place — a banking crisis, for a lack of a better way of putting it, moments where there’s a crisis and people say, ‘Hey look, I need to make sure that I can preserve my asset pool. My real assets need to go up, my safe-haven asset.’</p>
    	<p>When the Fed has managed to cool off the economy, once that starts to develop, that monetary policy will loosen up, the ability for gold to start to see itself run. Right now what we’re seeing is range-bound pricing on the gold market. So you see us holding firm at about a $1,850, $1,900, almost $1,950 level, but not breaking out. We had a moment earlier in the year around that banking crisis where we did break out, but we’re not really breaking out just yet. And it’s simply because most institutional investors have not come back to the table. The range-bound pricing behavior we’re getting is being held up by mainly a lot of buying by central banks, which is a trend we’ve been seeing for a long time.</p>	
    	<p>Q: I’m interested in the idea of gold as a haven asset. Why would someone go for gold instead of something like Treasuries?</p>	
    	<p>A: Well, I think what you start to see are two factors that are pretty significant in terms of performance. It’s a limited-source asset. So over long-term performance, you’ll see that gold will actually appreciate. And ultimately what you find with the asset is second, it’s very liquid. The asset trades about $150 billion a day. So what I’d say is those factors really weigh in and actually make people feel comfortable and confident. And they are not linked to anything like a credit rating or a dollar currency or whatever the case may be that could have another level of impact on the overall price performance and trading activity of an asset. So you’re really looking at a unique asset that stands by itself. And ultimately with these unique drivers for consumption will continue to push the price higher over time. And that’s why I think people feel comfortable and confident putting it as a component — not the only component — in a portfolio.</p>

    	<p>A Ukrainian drone strike damaged a Russian ship near the port of Novorossiysk, forcing the key export hub for Moscow's oil and grain to temporarily halt traffic.</p>
    	<p>With help from the Ukrainian navy, security services sent two sea drones to carry out the attack, sources told the Financial Times, though Kyiv officially did not take responsibility.</p>	
    	<p>While denied by Russian officials, video of the attack on the Olenegorsky Gornyak appeared to show the amphibious assault ship sustained damage and needed to be towed.</p>
      <p>The port of Novorossiysk is home to a Russian navy base and exports about 600,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
      <p>After the drone attack, wheat futures jumped as much as 3.5% Friday morning, while Brent crude futures rose 0.6%.</p>
      <p>The attack was preceded by a number of Russian assaults on Kyiv's grain export infrastructure these past weeks, such as Wednesday drone strike on Ukraine's primary inland port on the Danube River.</p>
      <p>According to Reuters, the attack damaged 40,000 tons of grain headed towards African nations, as well as China and Israel.</p>
      <p>"Moscow is waging a battle for a global catastrophe," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address that followed. "In their madness, they need world food markets to collapse, they need a price crisis, they need disruptions in supplies."</p>
      <p>The Kremlin's attacks came after it refused to extend a key grain deal held with Ukraine that helped secure safe passage for 33 million tons of crop exports since the deal was reached in July 2022.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ukraine's drone strike adds a new threat to Russia's commodity outflows, which are already limited Western sanctions and price caps.</p>	
    	<p>The attack is unlikely to be a one-off event, drone-expert Stephen Wright told Insider, but only signals more to come. Ukraine is focusing on building bigger and more powerful sea drones, and wants to "get more explosives on board" to ramp up its attacks, he said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Saudi Arabia has extended its one million barrel-per-day production cuts into September, while Russia announce it will cut oil exports, sending oil prices higher. Lipow Oil Associates President Andrew Lipow tells Yahoo Finance Live the move is "very significant." Lipow say the cuts "really emphasize the point that they are looking for higher prices, because the domestic budgets of these OPEC+ countries simply could not last when oil was under $70 a barrel."</p>
    	<p>AKIKO FUJITA: Oil prices rising for a sixth straight week. And today's gains driven by Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision to extend production cuts. Remaining OPEC plus members though deciding to keep output unchanged in a meeting today causing prices to rally further. It comes as extreme weather poses threats to US production.</p>	
    	<p>Let's bring in Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Andy, good to talk to you today. I'm looking at where oil prices are trading today-- oil futures, I should say, above that $80 a barrel mark. How supportive do you think these cuts announced by Saudi Arabia, as well as Russia will be in terms of price action?</p>	
    	<p>ANDREW LIPOW: Well, thanks for having me. I think these cuts are very significant. If we look back to October of last year, OPEC plus has cut over 5 million barrels a day from their production quotas. And these last voluntary cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia really emphasized the point that they're looking for higher prices because the domestic budgets of these OPEC plus countries simply could not last when oil was under $70 a barrel.</p>
      <p>- So Andy, do we expect to see oil hit $90 a barrel before the year is out?</p>
    	<p>ANDREW LIPOW: I think there's a very good possibility, especially as we've seen Saudi Arabia take these proactive steps to get the price of oil higher. I think they'd be quite comfortable to see Brent crude oil prices at around $90 a barrel and WTI at about $85. But the market could move higher because OPEC plus tends to be reactive. And of course, as prices rise, they're certainly going to think it's in their benefit to keep those higher prices higher for a longer period of time without triggering a recession around the world.</p>	
    	<p>AKIKO FUJITA: Andy, what are the supply-demand dynamics looking like right now? You know, on the one hand, we've got the prices above $80 a barrel, you've got the Russian cuts taking shape more. And yet you look at the demand picture at least in China where the biggest market is, we just haven't seen the kind of pickup in economic activity.</p>	
    	<p>ANDREW LIPOW: Well, I think that their economic activity is lagging, but we do see in the physical oil market China is buying record amounts of crude oil and processing record amounts of that oil in their new refineries and existing refineries. So the oil market is seeing the demand. The latest cut of 500,000 barrels a day by Russia was actually impacting China at the most because China, India, Turkey, and Bulgaria have become the four main customers of that Russian oil. So it does look to me like inventories around the world are declining and supplies are getting tighter</p>
      <p>- Andy, I want to ask you about just the impact of heat. It's not something over the years-- I've covered crude oil and it's not something that's been often in the conversation when you're talking about oil prices, oil inventories. What is the impact of extreme weather on that market?</p>
    	<p>ANDREW LIPOW: Well, there's a number of impacts. The first is that in the Middle East, we see them burning more crude oil for power generation to run their air conditioners during the summer. As far as refinery operations go, refineries, like people, do not like it when the heat index is 110 to 115. They simply can't have the equipment work as efficiently. And as a result, they're cutting their operating rates not only here in the Southern us, but in places like Greece and Italy where temperatures are even higher than what we see here in Texas.</p>
      <p>AKIKO FUJITA: So when you think about refineries having a breakdown, I mean this is already coming at a time when US inventory is low. To what extent is this-- as in the factor with the heat-- driving prices higher?</p>	
    	<p>ANDREW LIPOW: Well, it certainly exacerbates the problem along with these refinery unscheduled outages that we've seen around the coast, as well as in the Midwest. So as-- gasoline demand is increased about 3% over the last four weeks compared to last year and inventories are declining and makes for a mix of higher gasoline prices for the consumer</p>
      <p>Andy, I want to ask you about this. I've seen the Biden administration delaying some plans to restock the emergency oil reserves. Given where prices are, they've canceled this planned purchase. The energy department canceling this, this week.</p>	
    	<p>So what does that say to you? Is that a good move? I mean, considering, especially given that you see WTI heading towards $85 a barrel, what's your thought on that?</p>
      <p>ANDREW LIPOW: I think that the Biden administration is very focused on gasoline prices because it's such a pocketbook issue. I think the fact that the administration canceled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve purchases of 3 million barrels a month, they're really very small in the scheme of the oil market. It's less than 100,000 barrels a day when world oil demand is over 100 million barrels a day.</p>	
    	<p>AKIKO FUJITA: Looking at gas prices right now, Andy, I'm looking at $3.80 right now a gallon. We have seen that number continue to tick up over the last few weeks. Are we going to see it push even higher going into year end or is this just something that we're seeing given the inventory picture right now?</p>
      <p>ANDREW LIPOW: Well, I think over the next couple of weeks, we could see gasoline prices tick a little bit higher. We've got the bulk of the hurricane season ahead of us in the Gulf of Mexico. But as we get into the winter months being October for the oil market, we see that refiners are able to make the cheaper grade of winter gasoline. And that would mitigate further price rises.</p>	
    	<p>- All right, Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Thank you so much, and have a great weekend, and try to stay cool in Texas.</p>
      <p>ANDREW LIPOW: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- OPEC+ signaled it will stay the course as group leader Saudi Arabia extends a production cut aimed at shoring up global oil markets.</p>
    	<p>A monitoring committee comprising the kingdom and other key OPEC+ nations recommended no changes to the coalition’s supply policy at an online meeting on Friday, according to a delegate, who asked not to be named because the information was private.</p>	
    	<p>Riyadh announced on Thursday that it will extend a unilateral cutback of 1 million barrels a day into September — and potentially deepen the reduction after that — to support a fragile market. Crude prices are trading near a three-month high above $85 a barrel in London, yet fears over China’s economic rebound cloud the demand outlook.</p>	
    	<p>The committee “will continue to closely assess market conditions” and noted that OPEC+ members are willing “to address market developments and stand ready to take additional measures at any time,” according to a statement on the organization’s website.</p>
      <p>Major consuming nations have criticized the Saudis for constricting output when oil markets are already on track to tighten significantly, warning that a renewed inflationary spike would inflict more pain on consumers.</p>
    	<p>The kingdom is getting some assistance from fellow OPEC+ member Russia, which is finally delivering on pledges to curb its supplies. Moscow announced on Thursday it will also continue export restraints into September, but taper them slightly to 300,000 barrels a day.</p>	
    	<p>The country is pumping 9.5 million barrels a day now, in line with its pledge to reduce production by 500,000 barrels a day since March, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in an interview with Rossiya 24 TV on Friday.</p>	
    	<p>The global oil market “is quite stable,” and prices are at an “acceptable level,” Novak said.</p>
      <p>The current effort is largely confined to the two OPEC+ leaders: several other nations among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners are pumping below their assigned quotas and unable to cut further, plagued by inadequate investment and political instability.</p>
    	<p>Defending the oil market has come at a cost for the Saudis, requiring them to slash output to a two-year low near 9 million barrels a day. The kingdom suffered the sharpest downgrade to economic growth projections by the International Monetary Fund, which sees the country expanding by just 1.9% this year, a fraction of its performance in 2022.</p>	
    	<p>The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee will convene again on Oct. 4, according to the statement, while the full 23-nation OPEC+ alliance is due to meet in late November.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Friday after a slightly weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report pushed the dollar and Treasury yields lower, offering some respite to bullion which was still on track for its worst week in six.</p>	
    	<p>Nonfarm payrolls increased by 187,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 200,000 jobs.</p>	
	    <p>Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,940.86 per ounce by 2:52 p.m. EDT (1852 GMT). Bullion, however, was down 0.9% so far this week.</p>
      <p>U.S. gold futures settled 0.4% higher at $1,976.10.</p>
    	<p>"The jobs report has allowed the market to propose that the Federal Reserve is not as likely to raise interest rates. As a result, we've seen bond yields drop along with the dollar and that is certainly supporting the price of gold," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.</p>	
    	<p>Following the data, the dollar fell 0.5% against its rivals, making gold less expensive for other currency holders. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields retreated from a nine-month high. [USD/] [US/]</p>	
	    <p>According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, the probability that the Fed leaves rates unchanged at its September 19-20 meeting is now around 85% from around 78% just prior to the data coming out.</p>
      <p>Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>
    	<p>"The data was bit weaker-than-expected, but not dramatically so, which is why a small slight rise in prices this morning ... Any dips (in gold) over the course of the next couple weeks, is likely going to be a buying opportunity," Meger said.</p>	
    	<p>Elsewhere, spot silver gained 0.1% to $23.58 per ounce and platinum rose 0.6% to $919.36. Both were set for their third consecutive weekly loss.</p>	
	    <p>Palladium eased 0.1% to $1,256.97 per ounce.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Warren Buffett stock Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported mixed second-quarter financials Wednesday, slightly missing on profit expectations while matching revenue expectations, as low oil and natural gas prices in the first half of the year continue to take their toll. OXY stock lost ground in early trade Thursday.</p>
    	<p>While oil and natural gas prices have retreated in 2023, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) has continued to invest in those areas.</p>	
    	<p>The billionaire investor bought up Occidental Petroleum stock throughout the first half of the year, bringing his stake in the Houston-based company to 25%.</p>	
    	<p>The Warren Buffett stock dropped 2.4% early Thursday, after ending down 1.9% at 61.45 on Wednesday. Berkshire also holds a stake in Dow Jones energy giant Chevron (CVX). On Tuesday, CVX dropped 0.8%. CVX and ExxonMobil (XOM) reported on Friday that second-quarter sales fell around 30% with profits sinking 50% compared to a year ago.</p>
      <h3>Warren Buffett Stock: Occidental Petroleum Earnings</h3>
      <p>Estimates: Analysts expected Occidental Petroleum to report earnings sinking 77% to 72 cents per share in Q2. Meanwhile, Wall Street forecast revenue falling 37% to $6.7 billion.</p>
      <p>Results: Occidental Petroleum reported EPS of 68 cents, down 78% vs. 2022, as sales fell 37% to $6.7 billion.</p>
      <p>OXY announced oil and gas pre-tax income for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.1 billion, down 73% from Q2 2022.</p>
      <p>OXY reported Wednesday that income from its oil and gas operations declined due to lower domestic natural gas and natural gas liquids prices (NGL) as well as lower domestic crude oil volumes.</p>
      <p>Average Q2 worldwide crude oil prices fell 22% to $73.59 per barrel, according to OXY. Meanwhile, the company said average worldwide NGL prices decreased 545 $19.08 per barrel in Q2.</p>
      <p>Occidental produced 1.218 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding the mid-point of its guidance. OXY announced Wednesday it expects average full-year production of 1.210 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
      <p>In Q1, OXY had forecast full-year production guidance to average 1.195 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Occidental Petroleum executives previously forecast 2023 production to average 1.18 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, keeping production mostly flat compared to the 1.16 million in 2022.</p>
      <p>Occidental Petroleum also repurchased $425 million of stock in Q2. So far in 2023, OXY completed around 40% of its $3 billion repurchase program.</p>
      <h3>Warren Buffett And His Energy Plays</h3>
      <p>On July 10, Warren Buffett upped his bet on liquefied natural gas, agreeing to buy the Dominion Energy (D) share of the Maryland-based Cove Point LNG export plant in a $3.3 billion deal. Berkshire already owns a stake.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on June 28 Buffett announced Berkshire purchased an additional 2.14 million shares of OXY over three days. Berkshire bought Occidental Petroleum stock at prices between 57.01-57.17. The OXY purchases brought Berkshire's total stake in Occidental Petroleum to 25%.</p>
      <p>Buffett sold around $6 billion worth of Chevron stock in the first quarter, according to Berkshire's Q1 financial report.</p>
      <p>Buffett's outfit reported reducing CVX holdings to $21.6 billion as of March 31. Warren Buffett began buying the Dow Jones stock in 2020. Prior to Buffett's Q1 decision to sell, Berkshire Hathaway amassed a stake totaling 167 million CVX shares, worth around $29 billion.</p>
      <p>Investors will get a better idea about Warren Buffett stocks OXY and CVX this weekend when Berkshire Hathaway reports Q2 results.</p>
      <h3>Warren Buffett Stock: Crude Oil Prices Above $80</h3>
      <p>Currently, oil markets have undergone a change of heart. Crude oil prices have rallied for several weeks, topping $80 a barrel late last week for the first time since mid-April.</p>
      <p>However, prices moved lower Wednesday even as the Energy Information Administration (EIA) announced U.S. commercial crude oil inventories fell by 17 million barrels from the previous week. At 439.8 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are approximately 1% below the five-year average for this time of year, according to EIA data.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude futures fell around 2% to around $79.70 per barrel on Wednesday. On Monday, crude rose 1.5% to $81.80, the highest since April. U.S. crude soared 15.8% in July, its best monthly gain since January 2022.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures edged down more than 1% to $83.60 Wednesday, with the international oil benchmark up 14.2% in July.</p>
      <p>The market is focusing on tighter global supply amid Saudi-led cuts while demand hopes are improving. Odds of a U.S. recession have fallen, while Chinese authorities recently pledged to step up stimulus, bolstering the demand outlook for the world's top crude importer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas futures traded around $2.49 per million British thermal units Wednesday. Investors anticipate homes and businesses will use less gas as the weather turns cooler in the next two weeks. Natural gas plants generating electricity will see less demand (like other power plants) due to reduced air conditioning use.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>When the West rolled out its unprecedented price cap on Russian oil late last year, it hoped to starve Moscow of much-needed revenue while minimising the impact on other countries.</p>
    	<p>Eight months on, it is seen in Western capitals as a successful part of the squeeze on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but a policy that has yet to be properly tested, according to energy analysts.</p>	
    	<p>With oil prices on the rise after months in the doldrums, the cap's impact -- and limits -- could now come into clearer focus.</p>
      <p>"We also know, like with all of our measures, Russia will attempt to evade the price cap," Eric Van Nostrand, the US Treasury's acting assistant secretary for economic policy, said in a speech Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We remain vigilant in monitoring oil markets and the whole coalition remains focused on enforcing our sanctions."</p>
      <p>The mechanism, a price ceiling of $60 per barrel on Russian oil, was agreed and introduced by the European Union, G7 and Australia, in early December.</p>
      <p>Companies based in EU and G7 member states and Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, of oil above that price.</p>
      <p>It aims to restrict Russia's revenue as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine, while making sure Moscow keeps supplying the global market.</p>
      <p>"Russia's revenue is, you know, nearly 50 percent lower than it was a year ago," a senior US official told reporters Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"We're not evaluating the success of this policy based on how many molecules of oil are actually traded under $60," he added.</p>
      <p>"We're evaluating the success of this based on whether Russia's aggregate revenue is suffering relative to an unrestricted market."</p>
      <p>- 'Not been tested' -</p>
      <p>"The G7 price cap has done what it was designed to do -- restrict Russian revenues while keeping oil in the market," Matthew Holland, an analyst at Energy Aspects, told AFP.</p>
      <p>Helge Andre Martinsen, an analyst at DNB, noted Russian oil export volumes have been "surprisingly stable" and the price cap had "really not been tested due to a softening oil market".</p>
      <p>Moscow had taken its own steps to soften the impact of the price cap, including before its introduction eight months ago.</p>
      <p>The US official noted it had offered steeply discounted long-term contracts, around 30 percent below Brent Crude prices, to buyers in southeast Asia and India, ahead of December 2022.</p>
      <p>Since then North Sea Brent Crude, the key benchmark for Europe, has remained below the $90 mark, while its US equivalent, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), has not exceeded $85 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Russian Urals, Moscow's oil benchmark, has mostly traded below the mandated $60-a-barrel price.</p>
      <p>However, prices have been on the rise in recent weeks, with production cuts by Russia and other members of OPEC+ blamed in part.</p>
      <p>In mid-July, Urals crude broke the $60-a-barrel barrier, according to reports based on data from pricing agency Argus Media.</p>
      <p>- 'Nervous' -</p>
      <p>Stephen Innes, analyst at SPI Asset Management, said the Russian production cut was "payback" on the West for its support for Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"They knew it would drive oil prices higher in the middle of peak driving US season while China was filling every teapot refinery to the brim," he added.</p>
      <p>But with prices on the rise, "it might be the first real test of the price cap", he added -- a forecast echoed by Martinsen.</p>
      <p>Holland argues Urals breaching the cap "will reduce interest in Russian oil from some buyers", citing India in particular, which the analyst said gets "nervous about sanctions risks".</p>
      <p>Moreover, the cap has also forced Russia to build up a fleet that exists outside of the G7 to transport its oil.</p>
      <p>"Investments the Russian government makes into the shadow fleet or into its own insurance companies in order to sell above the cap, for example, draw funding away from its war chest as the Kremlin's cost of continuing the war in Ukraine continues to rise," said Van Nostrand.</p>	
    	<p>For Han Tan, analyst at Exinity, "the true results from this price cap, as desired by the West, will only be manifested if there's a meaningful pullback in Russia's war efforts".</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Gold prices reversed some of its gains on Thursday after Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating, which weighed on the US dollar, and had boosted the safe-haven asset.</p>
    	<p>At the time of writing, gold (GC=F) was trading down 0.26% at $1,969.80 an ounce. Since the start of the year it has gained about 8% but has not returned to the $2,081.58 peak seen on 3 May — close to the high last seen in March the previous year, just after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>	
    	<p>Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, told Yahoo Finance UK: “Gold has been trading at around $1,950 an ounce for most of this year. The precious metal is often seen as a safe haven, but investors also need to be careful not to equate this with price stability.</p>	
    	<p>“People do tend to flock to the precious metal in terms of financial stress, but it shouldn’t be taken as read that gold isn’t volatile. It is, and steep losses can be incurred. Between 1980 and 1982, the gold price fell by over 60%, and between 2011 and 2015, it fell by around 45%.”</p>
      <p>Gold has been a top performing asset in 2023, contributing positive returns to investor portfolios, the World Gold Council said in its mid-year outlook.</p>
      <p>However, the most recent data on gold’s rate of return to investors, published in January by Statista, showed the annual average return of gold in 2022 was just 0.4%. In 2021, it said the return of gold was around -3.6%.</p>
      <h3>What influences gold prices?</h3>
      <p>Gold is often considered a “safe haven” for being a reliable hedge against inflation and for when the economy is unstable. Gold usually retains its value regardless of economic conditions.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Fitch Ratings US downgrade supported the price of gold this week because it dented confidence in the US economy.</p>
      <p>The news also sent the dollar down, which in turn, further boosted the precious metal as it is priced in dollars, providing a lower price opportunity for investors purchasing it in other currencies.</p>
      <p>Interest rates are also known to impact the price of gold. While not guaranteed, the price of gold usually decreases when interest rates rise and increases when interest rates go down.</p>
      <p>As it stands, gold’s macroeconomic backdrop is uncertain after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points in July and left the door open for another rise in September.</p>
      <p>Analysts at ANZ said this could cap gold’s current price rise.</p>
      <p>“We expect shifting expectations around its terminal rate [which] could cap the upside in the near-term. Investment demand remains lacklustre, as investors wait for the Fed to end its tightening cycle."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said gold’s rally could extend if growth prospects turn sour.</p>
      <p>“If Wall Street starts aggressively in rate cuts by the first quarter of 2024, gold could easily find a home above the $2,000 level.”</p>
      <p>Moreover, supply and demand influences gold prices. The higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded — and the lower the price, the higher the quantity supplied.</p>
      <p>“I think gold is viewed as a safe haven asset by some investors. So in uncertain times there's probably more demand for it. Given you can't print it — more demand and limited supply can often lead to higher prices,” Simon Popple, managing director of Brookville Capital, said.</p>
      <p>Investor behaviour is also a driver of gold prices with many traders adopting a "herd" mentality when there's a price trend.</p>
      <h3>Gold’s co-relation with the dollar</h3>
      <p>Gold prices can fluctuate with currency swings, particularly the US dollar as the precious metal is priced in the currency.</p>
      <p>For example, when the Fitch downgrade sent the value of the dollar down, gold prices rose as other currencies gain value.</p>
      <h3>India’s gold appetite</h3>
      <p>India remains one of the largest gold markets in the world, along with China, according to World Gold Council data.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if the demand for gold in one of these countries subsides, it can also impact the price of gold.</p>
      <p>In India, demand increased in 2021 by about 78% to approximately 797.3 tonnes. This was a five-year high, according to this gold demand trends report by the World Gold Council.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, gold jewellery demand also doubled year-on-year in 2021, to touch a six-year high of about 610.9 tons.</p>
      <p>It was primarily fuelled by urban consumers and tied to weddings and festivals, such as Dhanteras and Dusshera, during which time buying gold is seen as crucial to the social aspect of celebrations.</p>
      <p>Khalaf said that while gold traders often think in just days or weeks, everyday investors usually want an asset they can hold for years, and the long-term case for gold is more nuanced.</p>
      <p>"Gold produces no cash flows and has few industrial uses, with demand mostly coming from jewellery manufacture and investment, so it’s more difficult to pin an intrinsic value on the precious metal. Consequently, the long term direction of gold is pretty difficult to gauge because with no cash flows to speak of, sentiment will play a larger part in pricing," he said.</p>
      <h3>Gold v stocks</h3>
      <p>Gold peaked in 1980 and fell 33% over the next 20 years, taking 27 years for it to reach its former high.</p>
      <p>“That’s a long period in the wilderness. The stock market has of course also experienced some lengthy spells of weak performance," said Khalaf.</p>
      <p>"From the height of the dot com bubble in 1999 to the depths of the pandemic in 2020, the FTSE 100 fell by almost 30%. But over this period, an investor would have still experienced a 50% return on their money, with dividends rolled up. There’s no such luck for long-term gold investors who receive no cash payments along the way.”</p>
      <p>However, gold provides diversification in a portfolio because it behaves differently to other assets, especially equities.</p>
      <p>“If you’re a conservative investor, you might therefore hold bonds and gold alongside equities because they will tend to perform well at different times. We also now live in a world where cash and bonds are offering much higher yields to investors and that does take some of the limelight away from gold,” Khalaf said.</p>

    	<p>Commuting got more expensive again in July as petrol prices rose for the second consecutive month while diesel remained stable, according to new data from RAC Fuel Watch.</p>
    	<p>The rising price at the pumps comes as the price of oil has been trading above the $80 level, even hitting $85 a barrel, with the cost of the commodity being passed down the chain to consumers.</p>	
    	<p>The question is, will sellers take lower margins as the wholesale costs climb or will consumers feel more price rises?</p>	
    	<p>As it stands, a litre of unleaded petrol across the UK costs 145p, up a penny since the start of July and nearly 2p since the beginning of June.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, diesel stayed the same at 146p, ending a run of eight months of falling prices.</p>
      <p>This means filling a tank for a 55-litre family car costs around £80 for either fuel — £80.21 for diesel and £79.75 for petrol.</p>
      <p>“Worryingly though, the wholesale price of petrol rose 6p a litre from 19 July on the back of the rising cost of oil with retailers wasting no time in passing this on to drivers as the average price has increased by nearly 2p in that time,” the RAC said.</p>
      <p>“July marks a turning point in the year for fuel prices as diesel stopped falling while petrol recorded its second consecutive monthly increase. But more concerning is the fact that oil has gone back up to $85 a barrel, causing wholesale prices to rise significantly,” RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said.</p>
      <p>“While we’re fortunately not in the kind of upward price spiral we experienced last year, it feels like the better times at the pump are over for the time being. If oil producers continue to curb production then bigger forecourt price rises could be on the cards.”</p>
      <p>Petrol and diesel are still cheaper in Northern Ireland despite prices rising by 1p and 3p respectively.</p>
      <p>“Unleaded is 4p less than the UK average (£2.20 a tank) and diesel almost 5p (£2.75 a tank). Sadly, this shows drivers on this side of the Irish Sea are still losing out. If and when we finally see the two sets of prices coming together we hope it will be as a result of lower forecourt prices in the rest of the UK,” Williams added.</p>

    	<p>By Brijesh Patel</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices slipped on Wednesday as the dollar rose and bond yields strengthened after data showed U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in July.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold was down 0.4% at $1,935.77 per ounce at 2:45 p.m. EDT (1845 GMT), after rising as much as 0.6% earlier on some safe-haven bids after ratings agency Fitch downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating to AA+ from AAA.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,975.</p>
      <p>"Higher interest rates would ultimately put pressure on gold. Also, we are seeing more strength in the dollar. Prices are trapped below $2,000 and above $1,900 for the time being," said Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.</p>
      <p>The dollar rose 0.3% to more than a three-week high, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields climbed to their highest level since November 2022. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>U.S. private payrolls rose by 324,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed, well above the increase of 189,000 that economists polled by Reuters had forecast.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points last week. According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, the probability that the U.S. central bank would leave rates unchanged at its Sept. 19-20 meeting was at 83%.</p>
      <p>Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>"Traders and investors are not badly shaken over the surprise Fitch news, but it did somewhat deflate heretofore upbeat marketplace attitudes that had recently pushed U.S. stock indexes to new highs for the year," Jim Wyckoff, senior market analyst at Kitco, wrote in a note. [.N]</p>
      <p>All eyes are on the release on Friday of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July. Overall payrolls are forecast to rise by 200,000, after increasing by 209,000 in June.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, spot silver fell 2.5% to $23.72 per ounce, platinum dropped 1.1% to $921.10 and palladium gained 0.1% to $1,240.74.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The UK government said Monday it would issue "hundreds" of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea to secure energy reserves while still aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
    	<p>The announcement angered environmental groups and comes amid an internal debate within the ruling Conservative party on green policies.</p>	
    	<p>The main opposition Labour party has said it will not issue any new North Sea drilling licences if it regains power in a general election due next year.</p>	
    	<p>"Investment in the North Sea will continue to unlock new projects, protect jobs, reduce emissions and boost UK energy independence," Downing Street said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February last year saw a global surge in energy prices as Western nations imposed sanctions against Moscow, targeting in particular its massive oil and gas exports.</p>
      <p>On a visit to Scotland, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the licensing decision was "entirely consistent with transitioning to net zero".</p>
      <p>He said that even if Britain achieves net zero by mid-century, around a quarter of its energy needs will still come from oil and gas.</p>
      <p>"What is important then is that we get that oil and gas in the best possible way. And that means getting it from here at home better for our energy security, not reliant on foreign dictators, better for jobs... but also better for the climate," Sunak added.</p>
      <p>A study released Monday by the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) said the carbon footprint from domestic UK gas production was one-fourth the footprint from imported liquified natural gas.</p>
      <p>- 'Betrayal of British people' -</p>
      <p>But the licensing announcement prompted a backlash from environmental groups with Greenpeace calling it a "deliberate attempt to polarise the climate debate in the UK and score cheap political points".</p>
      <p>Hugo Tagholm, director of Oceana UK, an ocean advocacy organisation, said the decision was a "betrayal of the British people" showing "no regard for a future for our children and generations to come".</p>
      <p>"July was the hottest month ever because of burning fossil fuels," Just Stop Oil, which wants the UK government to end all new oil and gas exploration, said.</p>
      <p>"Sunak is worse than a war criminal. He knows new oil and gas will impose unimaginable suffering and destroy the lives and livelihoods of billions of people," the group added.</p>
      <p>Also on Monday, the government confirmed plans to build two more carbon-capture facilities along the North Sea coast, at Acorn in northeast Scotland and Viking near Humber, England, alongside two already under construction.</p>
      <p>It said the four clusters could support up to 50,000 jobs by 2030.</p>
      <p>Energy giant Shell, which is involved in one of the carbon capture projects, hailed it as a "central part of plans to decarbonise North Sea operations".</p>
      <p>The technology, however, has been criticised by some climate experts, who say it risks distracting from efforts to phase out hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p>- 'Green gloss' -</p>
      <p>Greenpeace said carbon capturing is "often used for greenwashing by oil and gas companies so they can carry on polluting".</p>
      <p>"Talking up carbon capture and storage is an obvious attempt to put a green gloss on the prime minister's announcement," Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said.</p>
      <p>Environmental policies have been a hot topic in the UK, especially since Labour's surprise defeat by the ruling Conservative party in a west London by-election.</p>
      <p>Their defeat, by less than 500 votes, has been blamed on voter unease at Labour mayor Sadiq Khan expanding a scheme taxing the use of the most polluting vehicles, and appears to have emboldened Tory net zero opponents.</p>
      <p>In a Telegraph interview on Sunday, Sunak insisted he was on the side of motorists and said he had ordered a review of so-called low traffic neighbourhoods, contentious local authority-led measures to limit vehicle use in designated areas by blocking roads.</p>
      <p>Climate campaigners have accused the British leader of lacking conviction on climate policies and playing politics with the issue, with a general election looming amid a cost-of-living crisis.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Oil prices will stall this year as weak economic growth is expected to curb demand and offset the impact of OPEC+ production cuts on supply, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.</p>	
    	<p>A survey of 37 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude would average $81.95 a barrel in 2023, down from June's $83.03 consensus and current levels of around $85. Brent was forecast to average $83.67 next year.</p>	
    	<p>The global benchmark has averaged around $80 so far this year.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude was seen averaging $77.20 a barrel in 2023, down from the previous month's $78.38 forecast, and $78.25 in 2024.</p>
      <p>"We expect the impact of high interest rate levels to start curbing economic growth more strongly over H2 2023," data and analytics firm Kpler said, maintaining "a comparatively bearish view on the market".</p>
      <p>Central banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the ECB, raised interest rates to historic highs this month.</p>
      <p>Sluggish growth in top crude importer China has also weighed on oil prices so far in 2023.</p>
      <p>However, Chinese stimulus measures and a pick-up in air travel could buoy prices later this year, analysts said.</p>
      <p>Global oil demand was expected to increase by about 1-2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023, led by China.</p>
      <p>"China's economic outlook may continue to disappoint but upside in oil demand is still possible with jet demand recovery from international flights later this year," said Ajay Parmar, associate director of global oil markets research at HSBC.</p>
      <p>Some of the analysts expected supplies to tighten and support oil prices in the latter part of this year after Saudi Arabia and Russia deepened output cuts in July.</p>
      <p>"We're forecasting that the oil market will be in deficit in Q3 and Q4 2023 because of the cuts by OPEC+, which will not be offset by non-OPEC producers," said John Paisie, president of Stratas Advisors.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Monday, putting them on track for their best month in four, helped by a weaker dollar and expectations that major global central banks are nearing a peak with interest rate hikes.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold gained 0.4% to $1,967.77 per ounce by 02:39 p.m. EDT (1839 GMT). Bullion is up 2.5% so far this month.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. gold futures settled 0.5% higher at $2,009.20.</p>
      <p>The dollar index, meanwhile, was heading for its second straight monthly decline, making gold more attractive for other currency holders. [USD/]</p>
      <p>Recent data showing signs of cooling inflation in the United States has raised expectations that the Federal Reserve was closer to ending its fastest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>According to the CME's FedWatch Tool, the probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged this year is at 60%.</p>
      <p>"I don't think the Fed's going to make a move in September, but later in the year, if we continue to get strong economic data, the Fed probably will make one more rate-hike," said Jim Wyckoff, senior market analyst at Kitco.</p>
      <p>"Right now, the gold and silver markets are waiting for the next catalyst... if demand from China starts to recover, we see more upside in gold and silver."</p>
      <p>Two European Central Bank policymakers on Friday also raised the prospect of an end to its steepest and longest string of rate rises.</p>
      <p>Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>"Markets feel vindicated with their assessment that Fed rates are at or near their terminal rate, with key inflation reports from the U.S. all pointing towards a faster pace of disinflation," said Matt Simpson, senior analyst at City Index.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, silver rose about 1.8% to $24.77 per ounce. Platinum gained 1.8% to $952.55 and palladium climbed 3.1% to $1,284.05. All three were set for monthly gains.</p>

    	<p>BENGALURU (Reuters) -Oil prices rallied to a fresh three-month high on Monday and recorded their steepest monthly gains since January 2022, supported by signs of tightening global supply and rising demand through the rest of this year.</p>	
    	<p>More actively traded October Brent crude futures rose $1.02, or 1.2%, to settle at $85.43 a barrel. The September Brent contract, which expired at settlement on Monday, rose 0.7% to close at $85.56 a barrel.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rallied $1.22, or 1.5%, to $81.80 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Both Brent and WTI hit their highest since late April for a third consecutive session on Monday, after notching their fifth straight weekly gains on Friday.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia is expected to extend a voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for another month to include September. Saudi output fell by 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July, while total production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was 840,000 bpd lower, a Reuters survey found on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Crude prices are finishing a solid month on a high note as demand prospects remain impressive and no one doubts that OPEC+ will keep this market tight," OANDA analyst Edward Moya said.</p>
      <p>Oil inventories are beginning to drop elsewhere too, especially in the U.S., where the government has started refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve from its lowest level in multiple decades. Five analysts polled by Reuters on Monday estimated on average that U.S. crude inventories fell by about 900,000 barrels in the week to July 28.</p>
      <p>"After the end of SPR releases and recession fears and a liquidity drain due to bank stability fears, which caused the markets to ignore a looming supply squeeze, the coming supply deficits are getting too big to ignore," Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn said.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs estimated that global oil demand rose to a record 102.8 million bpd in July and it revised up 2023 demand by about 550,000 bpd on stronger economic growth estimates in India and the U.S., offsetting a downgrade for China's consumption.</p>

    	<p>West Texas Intermediate settled above $80 a barrel as US economic growth exceeded expectations and speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its monetary tightening cycle.

    	<p>“Crude extending the bullish rally, led by ‘risk back on’ sentiment in the equity markets, is keeping the buyers present in the crude space,” said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities. Yet “the market has gone up too far, too fast with speculative buying, and that is creating the overbought condition, so we should see some erratic corrections soon.”</p>	
    	<p>Oil has broadly rallied since late June, aided by supply cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, and signs that Russian seaborne crude exports are falling. But higher fuel prices are adding renewed inflationary pressure in the global economy, with gasoline surging around the world.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia is expected to extend its 1 million barrel-a-day oil supply cut into September as it seeks to foster a tentative recovery in prices. With Russia also curbing output, banks including Standard Chartered Plc anticipate a deepening shortfall in the coming months.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices slipped more than 1% to a two-week low on Thursday, weighed down by a stronger dollar and an uptick in bond yields after better-than-expected U.S. economic data.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold dropped 1.2% to $1,948.69 per ounce by 01:53 p.m. EDT (1753 GMT), its lowest since July 12. U.S. gold futures settled 1.2% lower to $1,945.70.</p>	
    	<p>"There was a one and two punch on gold with a better-than-expected initial claims numbers showing that the strength of the U.S. labor market is resilient," said Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago.</p>
      <p>"Then also that surprise upside expectation in GDP data as well shows you that if there is any recession, it's just not no one seeing it right now. So it paves the way for higher for longer on interest rates."</p>
      <p>Data showed the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter as labor market resilience underpinned consumer spending.</p>
      <p>A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended July 22.</p>
      <p>Following the data, the dollar index jumped 0.8% against its rivals, making gold more expensive for other currency holders. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield climbed to a two-week high..</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected. Markets priced in 57% odds of the Fed holding rates for the rest of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates for the ninth consecutive time on Thursday and kept the door open to further tightening.</p>
      <p>Rising interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>Spot silver was down 2.8% to $24.20 per ounce, platinum fell 2.7% to $935.26 while palladium dropped 1.4% to $1,240.99.</p>

      <p>In this article:</p>
	    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The considerable ownership by retail investors in Rusoro Mining indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy</li>
        <li>A total of 5 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>A look at the shareholders of Rusoro Mining Ltd. (CVE:RML) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 47% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.</p>
      <p>While retail investors were the group that benefitted the most from last week’s CA$34m market cap gain, insiders too had a 28% share in those profits.</p>
      <p>Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Rusoro Mining, beginning with the chart below.</p>
      <h3>What Does The Lack Of Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Rusoro Mining?</h3>
      <p>Small companies that are not very actively traded often lack institutional investors, but it's less common to see large companies without them.</p>
    	<p>There could be various reasons why no institutions own shares in a company. Typically, small, newly listed companies don't attract much attention from fund managers, because it would not be possible for large fund managers to build a meaningful position in the company. On the other hand, it's always possible that professional investors are avoiding a company because they don't think it's the best place for their money. Rusoro Mining might not have the sort of past performance institutions are looking for, or perhaps they simply have not studied the business closely.</p>
      <p>Hedge funds don't have many shares in Rusoro Mining. Gold Fields Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 24% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 14% and 5.9% of the stock. Note that the second and third-largest shareholders are also Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively, meaning that the company's top shareholders are insiders.</p>
      <p>Our research also brought to light the fact that roughly 51% of the company is controlled by the top 5 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.</p>
      <p>Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.</p>
      <h3>Insider Ownership Of Rusoro Mining</h3>	
    	<p>While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.</p>
      <p>Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.</p>
      <p>Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Rusoro Mining Ltd.. Insiders own CA$57m worth of shares in the CA$203m company. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business.</p>
      <h3>General Public Ownership</h3>	
    	<p>The general public-- including retail investors -- own 47% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.</p>
      <h3>Public Company Ownership</h3>
      <p>It appears to us that public companies own 24% of Rusoro Mining. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.</p>
      <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
      <p>It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Rusoro Mining better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 5 warning signs for Rusoro Mining (of which 4 are significant!) you should know about.</p>
      <p>Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.</p>

    	<p>Copper prices are still well below their February highs but SCCO just made a new 52-week high. What gives?</p>
    	<p>Stocks quotes in this article: SCCO</p>	
    	<p>In a Real Money column on March 1, I recommended the long side of Southern Copper Corp (SCCO)  and then updated the charts on April 11.</p>
      <p>SCCO shares made a new 52-week high on Tuesday so let's check out the charts again.</p>
      <p>In the updated daily bar of the continuous futures contract of copper, below, I can see a constructive-looking picture. Prices have just moved above the 50-day and 200-day moving average lines. The slope of the 50-day has yet to turn positive.</p>
      <p>Copper prices are still well below their February highs but SCCO just made a new 52-week high. What gives? Mining companies tend to lead the movement in the underlying metal. Why? Simple -- If you believe copper (or gold or silver or other metals) is going higher in price but you are not sure when you would buy the unleveraged mining company before buying a leveraged futures contract. With a futures position the timing is key. With the equity position we just remain patient.</p>
      <p>In the daily bar chart of SCCO, below, I can see that the share price made a new high for the move up. SCCO trades above the rising 50-day moving average line and above the rising 200-day line.</p>
      <p>Trading volume has been more active from November and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been in a rising trend for the past year and tells me that buyers of SCCO have been more aggressive than sellers. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish alignment above the zero line.</p>
      <p>In the weekly Japanese candlestick chart of SCCO, below, I can see that the shares have made a large upper level base pattern covering the past two years plus. Prices trade above the rising 40-week moving average line.</p>
      <p>The weekly OBV line drifted lower from early 2021 but it looks like it is showing renewed strength. The MACD oscillator is above the zero line and turning upwards to a fresh outright buy signal.</p>
	    <p>In this daily Point and Figure chart of SCCO, below, I can see the upside breakout and a potential price target in the $98 area.</p>
      <p>In this weekly Point and Figure chart of SCCO, below, it projects a price target in the $115 area.</p>
      <p><strong>Bottom-line strategy:</strong> Traders should continue to hold earlier purchases. Raise stops to $74. The $98 area is my new price target with $115 a longer-term objective.</p>

    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Monday as tightening supply and hopes for Chinese stimulus measures underpinned Brent at well above $80 a barrel, even as traders expected more rate hikes from U.S. and European central banks.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures were up 91 cents, or 1.1%, at $81.98 a barrel by 1415 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $78.12 a barrel, also up $1.05, or 1.3%.</p>	
    	<p>The benchmarks rose 1.5% and 2.2% respectively last week, their fourth straight of week of gains, as supply is expected to tighten following OPEC+ cuts.</p>
      <p>Fighting also escalated last week in Ukraine after Russia withdrew from a U.N.-brokered safe sea corridor agreement for grain exports.</p>
      <p>Oil's rise has reflected "tightening conditions as Saudi oil output cuts impact the market ... even as summer demand has been somewhat stronger for gasoline and jet fuel", Citi Research said in a note.</p>
      <p>The bank said it sees some upside for oil over the summer and forecast an average price in the third quarter of $83 a barrel.</p>
      <p>"While another Fed rate hike this week may drive some short-term price volatility, we expect tightening market conditions on OPEC's supply cuts and increasing market speculation of further stimulus in China to continue to push prices higher through 3Q23," analysts from National Australian Bank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Investors have priced in quarter-point hikes from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank this week, so the focus will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde say about future rate increases. [MKTS/GLOB]</p>
      <p>Rising interest rates have dampened investment and strengthened the greenback, making dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.</p>
      <p>In China, the state planner on Monday unveiled measures to spur private investment in some infrastructure sectors, and said it will also strengthen financing support for private projects.</p>
      <p>Market participants expect Beijing to implement targeted stimulus measures to support its flagging economy, likely boosting oil demand in the world's No. 2 consumer.</p>

    	<p>Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript July 20, 2023. Newmont Corporation misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.33 EPS, expectations were $0.44.</p>
    	<p>Operator: Good morning and welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.</p>	
    	<p>Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience, and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.</p>
      <p>Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy. And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value, and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations.</p>
      <p>There were four important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Peñasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the Union representing our workforce in Mexico. This dispute is associated with a profit-sharing agreement that we made with the Union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit-sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The Union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor. At Newmont, Peñasquito sits within a strong, balanced global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet.</p>
      <p>During this important time for Peñasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers, and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the Union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleón Gómez to cease this strike action and return their members to work. The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Éléonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance. Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for two weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there.</p>
      <p>And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the gen pit over the next few months. As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tonnes mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tonnes mined Cerro Negro is the first wave of our district expansion which comes online in the third quarter. Higher tonnes mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Higher grade run-of-mine ore processed at Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our two non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment-grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.</p>
      <p>We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp four years ago as we build out our integration plans. We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, making the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years. At Newmont, we recognize that a strong, safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well-run business.</p>
      <p>It is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability. In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack for the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving value-based decisions. Over the last five years, as our Senior Vice President, Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance, in particular, in the area of fatality risk management.</p>
      <p>Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination. I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.</p>
      <p>Rob Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with five additional trucks as we increased the planned waste movement in both the North and the South pits. This investment into the next layback at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance, and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.</p>
      <p>Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the Northern Territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation in Tanami. Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both the Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana.</p>
      <p>At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we work through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months. As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges. At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we access the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Fined with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half.</p>	
      <p>Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year. And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation in bulk airports continue to progress very well and with the new mining fleet in place, the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year. Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec, particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June, as the fire front approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Éléonore on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors.</p>
      <p>During this time, our first priority was, and will always be, the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We're now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate. And we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis. Moving to Porcupine, we delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well-positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden Underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year.</p>
      <p>We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the premarket and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024. At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progress planned development activities that will increase scope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double lift stope [ph]. As a consequence, we expect tonnes mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter. And finally, Cripple Creek and Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities. And now moving down to South America.</p>
      <p>Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian Pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance. Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tonnes mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to, and grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher-grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of six new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro.</p>
      <p>San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023. Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Peñasquito on June 7, as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly, fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Peñasquito.</p>
      <p>And now I'll wrap up on the next slide with our two non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second half. And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.</p>
      <p>Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have. Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success. Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed our initial expectations.</p>
      <p>Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle. Turning to the next slide. Let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million, cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by a draw on receivables.</p>
      <p>We would expect to draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters. The tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years. In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and margins in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter, driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.</p>
      <p>Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction cost associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest, and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items. Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito since the strike commenced and at Éléonore, while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires. As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well-positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last two quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share.</p>
      <p>We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the time line from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.</p>
      <p>Tom Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. Over the last two months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions, whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood. Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government. Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials including Prime Minister, James Marape; Deputy Prime Minister, John Russo; and Mining Minister, Sir Ano Pala.</p>
      <p>As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Waihi gold boom project. We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio. Then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results. With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>It was another week when oil prices moved up while natural gas futures marked a loss.</p>
	    <p>On the news front, the headlines came from energy biggie ExxonMobil’s XOM acquisition of carbon management expert Denbury Inc. and its European peer Shell’s SHEL oil find offshore Namibia. Developments associated with SLB SLB, BP plc BP and Ring Energy REI also made it to the headlines.</p>	
	    <p>Overall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 2.1% to close at $75.42 per barrel but natural gas prices dropped 1.7% to end at $2.54 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).</p>	
	    <p>In particular, the crude price action continued to be positive, with a steady decline in inflation rates and the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hikes. A weaker greenback also supported the dollar-denominated commodity.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, natural gas found itself on the opposite side on forecasts of cooler-than-expected temperatures and therefore limiting air conditioning demand.</p>
      <h3>Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories</h3>
      <p>1.  U.S. supermajor ExxonMobil has entered into an agreement to acquire oil producer Denbury Inc. for $4.9 billion. The move is part of ExxonMobil’s plan to enhance its transition to clean energy with a well-established carbon dioxide sequestration operation. The acquisition will provide XOM access to the biggest pipeline network in the United States.</p>
      <p>Denbury exited bankruptcy in September 2020. The company’s main business is to churn out crude. The majority of DEN’s revenues are generated from enhanced oil recovery or injecting carbon dioxide into wells to extract more oil. Denbury is also an expert in carbon management. The acquisition gives ExxonMobil ready-made carbon dioxide transportation, allowing XOM to make carbon capture a profitable business.</p>
      <p>Oil and gas companies are actively involved in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. These offer a transition pathway for the rapid and effective reduction of carbon dioxide emissions beyond what can be achieved by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels. (ExxonMobil Signs Deal to Acquire Denbury for $4.9B)</p>
      <p>2. Shell, a leading global energy company, announced its fourth oil discovery offshore Namibia. The successful drilling has confirmed the presence of hydrocarbon, marking a milestone in the company's efforts to explore and leverage new oil resources.</p>
      <p>The drilling operation by Shell, in collaboration with partners QatarEnergy and Namibia's national oil company, yielded positive results. Although further evaluation is required to determine the development potential of the discovered hydrocarbon, this recent achievement is a testament to SHEL’s expansion strategy in the region.</p>
      <p>Namibia, located in southwestern Africa, has emerged as an attractive destination for offshore oil exploration and production. Shell's recent discoveries, including the Graff and La Rona wells and TotalEnergies' Venus prospect in France, have generated significant excitement in the industry.

      <p>3.  U.S. oilfield service biggie SLB announced that it is halting all shipments of products and technology to Russia from all its operations due to the continuous expansion of Western sanctions. It was one of the few providers to continue working in the country's oil sector following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. With the most recent embargo, more countries are now subject to restrictions that have been in place since 2022.</p>
      <p>Management stated that the company takes its responsibility to comply with export control and economic sanction laws quite seriously.  It also added that SLB remains aligned with the international community in condemning and calling for an end to the war in Ukraine. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company said that the Russia ban now applies to all its worldwide operations and is not just restricted to the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and Canada.</p>
      <p>In order to comply with Western prohibitions on the transfer of oil equipment and technology, SLB reportedly changed its business operations earlier this year, per media reports. As part of the transformation, employees in Russia were denied access to specific communications and software platforms, and the unit was walled off from other activities. (SLB Halts Shipments to Russia From all of Its Operations)</p>
      <p>4.   BP came as a major winner in a 7-gigawatt (GW) offshore wind site auction in Germany, marking its entry into the offshore wind market in continental Europe. The London-based energy major BP and French multinational TotalEnergies acquired development rights for four sites in the Germany dynamic tender round, with combined bids of €12.6 billion.</p>
      <p>Three sites are situated 120 kilometers northwest of Heligoland in the North Sea. The sites are intended to develop 2 GW of offshore turbine capacity. The remaining one with 1 GW is located in the Baltic Sea. BP acquired rights to develop two projects, representing 4 GW of the total capacity. TotalEnergies received awards for the other two sites.</p>
      <p>The awards align well with BP’s integrated energy strategy and disciplined capital allocation. The company expected returns of 6-8% from the project. The latest move is a crucial step in implementing BP’s strategy to become a profitable integrated player in the electricity markets. (BP Makes Foray Into Continental Europe's Offshore Wind Market)</p>
      <p>5.   U.S.-based oil and gas producer Ring Energy recently agreed to buy the Central Basin Platform (“CBP”) assets of privately-held upstream company Founders Oil & Gas IV. The transaction, valued at $75 million, further solidifies Ring's presence in the Permian Basin and enhances its operational capabilities. The acquisition — to conclude by Sep 30 — is expected to be immediately accretive and bring various benefits to the company's shareholders.</p>
      <p>The total transaction value comprises $60 million in cash to be paid at closing, and an additional deferred cash payment of $15 million, which will be due four months after the closing date. Ring will fund the transaction using its available cash reserves and borrowings under its recently reaffirmed senior revolving credit facility.</p>
      <p>The acquisition of Founders' CBP assets strategically expands Ring's core operating area in Ector County, TX. This move allows REI to capture various cost synergies, further enhancing operational efficiency. The assets closely resemble the Stronghold assets acquired in the previous year, featuring high-quality rock formations and proven performance. Leveraging its expertise, Ring aims to optimize the undeveloped drilling locations available through the transaction. (Ring Energy to Acquire Permian Basin Assets for $75M)</p>
      <h3>Price Performance</h3>
      <p>The following table shows the price movement of some major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last six months.</p>
      <h3>Company             Last Week                 Last 6 Months</h3>
      <p>XOM                 -2.2%             -10.6%</p>
      <p>CVX                  -0.4%             -15%</p>
      <p>COP                 +3.7%            -11.5%</p>
      <p>OXY                  +1.3%            -8.4%</p>
      <p>SLB                  +7.1%            -3.3%</p>
      <p>RIG                   +1%               +30.6%</p>

      <p>MPC                 +0.3%             -3%</p>
      <p>With oil and gas moving in different directions, stocks were mixed. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — edged up 0.8% last week. But over the past six months, the sector tracker has decreased 9.8%.</p>
      <h3>What’s Next in the Energy World?</h3>
      <p>As usual, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for guidance on the direction of the commodities. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar. Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. Finally, there will be 2023 Q2 earnings, with the first batch of S&P 500 components coming up with quarterly results.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p><strong>Are New Highs in Store?</strong></p>
    	<p>In HYCM’s recent coverage of gold we focused on the sell-off following May’s highs, and attempted to identify price levels that could suggest further downside, or alternatively a bounce to higher-highs.</p>	
    	<p>In June, we identified the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at around $1905 as an important level, suggesting that if gold held it as support, it would add strength to the case that the recent sell-off was healthy consolidation, rather than a more concerning change of trend from bullish to bearish.</p>
      <p>For the moment, it appears that the 38.2% retracement level is holding. Gold has tested it as support and subsequently bounced to new daily and weekly higher-highs. In the process, it has also broken above the 23.6% retracement level, with only the $2000 psychological level, May’s peak, and the asset’s 2020 all-time high now remaining as obstacles.</p>
      <h3>The Story So Far</h3>	
    	<p>Gold rallied to around $2090 per ounce in 2020 during the pandemic as a safe-haven. It subsequently fell back down following an unprecedented injection of fiscal stimulus, which led to a boom in risk assets.</p>
      <p>Gold bulls returned in 2021 as inflation fears surfaced while the Federal reserve was still regarding the situation as transitory. It peaked early in 2022 with the commencement of the Ukraine conflict and sold off as the Federal Reserve commenced an aggressive rate hiking cycle in order to tame inflation.</p>
      <p>Between late 2022 and early 2023 gold rallied again in expectation of a pause from the Federal Reserve. The Fed being closer to the end of its tightening than the start, it slowed the pace of its hikes and finally did pause in the June 2023 meeting, which has reignited interest in the yellow metal.</p>
      <p>We have observed this same interest in our own investors, with gold being one of the HYCM’s most traded asset in 2022 and 2023.</p>
      <h3>What’s Boosting Gold Prices?</h3>
      <p>On the daily chart, following what appears to be a double-bottom at around $1915, gold experienced two sharp moves higher on Wednesday July 12, and Tuesday July 18. Each move saw gold closing around 1.2% higher, following key US economic data.</p>
      <p>The June 12 data that exerted the most impact on gold prices was undoubtedly the CPI report for June, which showed inflation cooling to 3% on an annualised basis. This has markets betting on another pause from the Fed in its July 26 meeting, with more aggressive market participants expecting a cut from the Fed by year end, even though it has given no such indication.</p>
      <p>On July 18, monthly retail sales data disappointed, suggesting that the US consumer is not in as strong a position as was previously thought. Core retail sales came in at 0.2%, to the market’s expectation of 0.4%. The broader reading also came in at 0.2%, much lower than Wall Street’s anticipated 0.5% figure.</p>
      <p>What this pair of economic reports could suggest is that the Fed has finally made some headway in its battle against inflation, and that this headway has come at the cost of consumer strength, which was always an outcome to be expected. Aside from gold’s technical picture, which we’ll focus on below, the above are fundamentals that can be thought positive for gold.</p>
      <p>Besides this, we also have US dollar weakness leading to gold strength. The dollar continues to weaken against its major trading counterparts, particularly the euro, as market participants attempt to price in the expected end of the tightening cycle (and perhaps return to rate cuts) taking place sooner in the US than in Europe.</p>
      <h3>Technical Picture</h3>
      <p>The most important levels to watch at the moment are the weekly May 2023 high at $1988, and the August 2020 weekly all-time high at around $2046. The fact that weekly highs are often lower than the extremes reached during intraday trading puts these levels within reach of current price action.</p>
      <p>Gold futures are currently trading at $1981, which means that May’s weekly high is only $7 away. A weekly higher-high would be extremely positive for the technical picture, indicating a possible continuation higher. This would see the $2000 level coming into play, which is important psychologically and proved to be stubborn for both gold bulls and bears back in May. Importantly, a break above $2000 builds a case for gold being able to test its weekly all-time high in dollar terms at $2046.</p>
      <p>On the downside, the range between $1905 and $1920 is important as support, with a break below $1915 possibly invalidating much of the above due to it representing a daily lower-low in price action. Before any such retreat, look for support to be established at the 26.6% retracement level at $1965.</p>

    	<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices edged lower on Wednesday, as investors took profits following earlier gains on tighter U.S. crude supplies and China's pledge to reinvigorate its economic growth.</p>	
    	<p>Brent futures dipped 17 cents at $79.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped 40 cents at $75.35 a barrel.</p>	
    	<p>Prices pared gains late in the session after both contracts had risen by over $1 a barrel. Market participants took advantage of the higher prices and took profits, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.</p>
      <p>Strength in the U.S. dollar index also weighed on prices. A stronger greenback makes crude more expensive for investors holding other currencies.</p>
      <p>Limiting losses, U.S. crude inventories fell by 708,000 barrels in the last week to 457.4 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a drop of 2.4 million barrels, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday. [EIA/S]</p>
      <p>The data showed inventories in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve climbed for the first time since January 2021, as the U.S. tries to refill the reserve following last year's record drawdown.</p>
      <p>"It's an end of an era," Flynn said. "We're reminded the SPR releases have come to an end, and the market is going to be on much more solid footing."</p>
      <p>In a measure that could boost oil demand, China's top economic planner pledged on Tuesday to roll out policies to "restore and expand" consumption in the world's second-largest economy.</p>
      <p>U.S. data on Tuesday showing retail sales rose less than expected in June boosted views that the Federal Reserve will stop raising interest rates. Higher rates increase borrowing costs and can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.</p>
      <p>In another positive sign, European Central Bank governing council member Klaas Knot on Tuesday suggested that rate hikes beyond the ECB's meeting next week were "by no means a certainty."</p>
      <p>"Traders have started to become a lot more optimistic as inflation eases off. ... Any improvement in the inflation data also means an improvement in oil demand," said Naeem Aslam of Zaye Capital Markets.</p>
      <p>Russia is set to reduce its oil exports by 2.1 million metric tons in the third quarter, in line with planned voluntary export cuts of 500,000 barrels per day in August, according to the country's energy ministry.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold rose over 1% on Tuesday to a more than one-month high, bolstered by a softer dollar and lower Treasury yields, with investors betting that recent U.S. economic readings make the case for a pause in the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Spot gold was up 1.1% at $1,975.49 per ounce by 2:03 p.m. ET (1803 GMT), after hitting the highest since late May. U.S. gold futures settled 1.2% higher at $1,980.80.</p>	
    	<p>The dollar index wobbled near more than a one-year low, making bullion more affordable to buyers holding other currencies. Benchmark Treasury yields ticked lower for the second straight day. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>"Gold can certainly move towards $2,000 if incoming data suggests the Fed will back off after one more hike this month," said Jim Wyckoff, senior market analyst at Kitco.</p>
      <p>Gold traders also took stock of data showing headline U.S. retail sales rose less than expected in June, though consumer spending appeared to be solid.</p>
      <p>While the data boosted the idea of a less hawkish Fed by the end of this year, which would help gold, prices could fall to the $1,900 range if the central bank goes the other way, Wyckoff added.</p>
      <p>Traders are pricing in another 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed's July 25-26 meeting.</p>	
    	<p>Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding zero-yielding gold.</p>
      <p>"Gold has now reached a key technical area around $1,980-$1,985, where it had previously found support and resistance. The bulls will need to see gold clear this level on a closing basis if they want to see $2,000 plus again," Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said in a note.</p>
      <p>Spot silver was up 0.6% at $25.01 per ounce, platinum rose 0.8% to $982.94 and palladium rose 2.5% to $1,315.91.</p>

    	<p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has signed long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) import deals with United Arab Emirates' s Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Co Ltd (ADNOC LNG) and France's TotalEnergies.</p>	
    	<p>The two deals were signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Visit to France and UAE last week. Supplies under the two deals would commence from 2026, the Indian company said in two separate statements.</p>	
    	<p>ADNOC LNG would supply up to 1.2 million metric tonnes per year (tpy) of LNG to IOC for 14 years, the Indian company said, adding India's trade treaty with UAE enable it to import LNG without paying a 2.5% import tax.</p>
      <p>This is the first time that an Indian company has signed a long term LNG import deal with ADNOC.</p>
      <p>TotalEnergies would supply 0.8 million tpy LNG to IOC under the 10 year deal, it said. TotalEnergies would supply LNG to IOC from its global portfolio.</p>
      <p>India companies are spending billions of dollars to boost their gas infrastructure and are scouting for long term LNG imports deals as the nation wants to raise the share of gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030 from 6.2% currently.</p>
      <p>IOC's signings are also the latest in a slew of term deals signed by Asian LNG importers in recent months. In June, Bangladesh's state-owned Petrobangla signed a 10-year contract to receive LNG supplies from OQ Trading, formerly known as Oman Trading International, and a 15-year suppy deal with QatarEnergy, starting 2026.</p>
      <p>Chinese importers Zhejiang Energy and ENN have also signed 20-year deals in recent weeks to receive North American supplies, after QatarEnergy inked 27-year agreements with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Thailand's state-controlled PTT is in advanced talks with Qatar for a 15-year LNG deal for supplies of 1 or 2 million tonnes per annum, sources told Reuters.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) -India's steel producer JSW Steel is considering a bid for a stake of up to 20% in Canada's Teck Resources steelmaking coal business, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
    	<p>The Indian steelmaker is in discussions with banks over potential financing for the acquisition, which may total about $2 billion, the report said, adding that the discussions are at early stage and details such as price and timing could change.</p>	
    	<p>Teck Resources declined to comment, while JSW Steel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>	
    	<p>Previously, Japanese steel maker Nippon Steel and Swiss trading and mining firm Glencore had also shown interest in the Canadian miner's coal unit. Nippon was interested in buying a stake and Glencore offered to buy the business as a standalone unit.</p>
      <p>Teck last month confirmed that it was engaging with Glencore on its coal proposal, in which Glencore had offered to demerge the coal units of both companies. Glencore mines and trades thermal coal, the fossil fuel used to produce electricity, as well as smaller amounts of coking coal to make steel.</p>
      <p>Teck, before confirming the Glencore proposal, had said it received several proposals for its coal business, as it reworks a plan to split it from its copper and zinc unit. The plan failed to secure enough shareholder support in late April.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in May that Canadian mining entrepreneur Pierre Lassonde was forming a consortium to buy a stake in Teck's coal business.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The second half of 2023 has officially begun, meaning it’s time for us to reflect on the commodities market so far this year. To view our interactive, updated Periodic Table of Commodities Returns, click here.</p>
    	<p>In the first half of the year, lithium increased by 10.81%, making it the best-performing commodity and one of only two that recorded a positive return, the other being gold. Every other commodity that we follow lost ground during the six-month period as global manufacturing activity receded and China’s economy, historically a major demand engine, delivered a disappointing rebound after ending three years of pandemic lock-downs.</p>	
    	<p>So why was lithium up in the first six months of 2023? In a word: batteries. The lightweight metal, the top performer in 2021 and 2022, is a key component of the boom in electric vehicle (EV) sales.</p>	
    	<p>First-quarter EV sales suggested a promising year for the market, with a predicted global sales figure of approximately 14 million vehicles. This would mark a robust 35% increase from 2022, raising the global electric sales share to about 18%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>
      <p>China, the world’s number three supplier of lithium after Australia and Chile, remains the largest EV market. Tesla’s production in the country rose nearly 20% last month, aiding in the company’s record-breaking quarterly sales. The Elon Musk-led manufacturer, our favorite EV play, delivered 93,680 cars from its Shanghai factory in June, a significant increase from the 78,906 units in the same month last year and 77,695 vehicles in May.</p>
      <p>Other car companies are rapidly shifting from combustion engine models to EVs or hybrids, boosting demand for lithium. Lamborghini, for instance, announced last year that it plans to invest at least 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) to create a hybrid lineup by 2024 and to introduce its fully electric model by the end of the decade. The Volkswagen-owned company reported that its final gas-burning models are now sold out for the remainder of production.</p>
      <h3>Hedging With Gold</h3>
      <p>Gold was also positive in the first half, rising 4.93% and outperforming most other major assets. Its value was supported by a stable U.S. dollar and continued demand from central banks. The yellow metal was also sought by investors as a portfolio diversifier, particularly during the mini-banking crisis in March.</p>
      <p>Central banks may be nearing the end of their interest rate tightening cycle, with the Federal Reserve expected to hike rates possibly one more time, especially after June’s strong jobs numbers. The market consensus suggests a mild economic contraction in the U.S. after the Fed pauses, along with slow growth in other developed markets.</p>
      <p>Given its robust performance in the first half, gold is projected to remain supported in the second half of the year by factors such as India’s stronger economy, potential Chinese economic stimulus and continued hedging strategies. If the risk of recession persists, gold could see greater upside potential due to increased demand for high-quality, liquid assets, according to the latest report by the World Gold Council (WGC).</p>
      <h3>Monthly PMIs Could Be Pointing To An Economic Contraction</h3>
      <p>If the monthly PMIs (purchasing manager’s indices) are any indication, a recession could indeed be in the cards in the coming months. The Global Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.8 in June from 49.6 in May, extending a period of contraction for the 10th straight month. A reduction in factory output due to dwindling new orders and mounting pessimism drove this past month’s decline, impacting key regions such as the U.S., the eurozone, Canada, Japan and others.</p>
      <p>As I’ve said many times before, we believe the global PMI to be a forward-looking economic indicator. This is particularly true of commodity prices, which largely slumped in the first half. Year-to-date through the end of June, agriculture commodities fell 5.77%, industrial metals lost 9.55% and energy, including oil and natural gas, retreated 11.56%. Precious metals were the only positively performing group.</p>
      <p>Notably hit were metals like iron ore and copper, significant indicators of cyclical portions of the global economy such as construction and manufacturing. These sectors are currently experiencing recessions in many regions.</p>
      <p>A slowdown in China’s property market, which directly impacts demand for construction materials like steel, aluminum, copper and nickel, also contributed to the declines. Despite output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the downturn in oil prices is primarily due to weak energy consumption, especially in Europe, and China’s increased focus on coal production amid an energy crisis.</p>
      <h3>Global Oil Demand To Plateau?</h3>
      <p>Looking ahead, global oil demand is projected to plateau over the next decade before entering a period of decline, largely due to increasing vehicle efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources, according to a new report by BP. The British oil and gas company expects the decline to be more pronounced after 2035, with projections for 2050 ranging from 20 to 75 million barrels per day (Mb/d), depending on the extent of global commitment to net-zero emissions.</p>
      <p>Emerging economies will maintain or slightly increase their oil consumption in the first half of the forecast period, contrasting with accelerating declines in the developed world. As a result, these economies will increase their share of global oil demand from 55% in 2021 to approximately 70% by 2050, BP writes.</p>
      <p>The first half of 2023 saw lithium and gold rise as the only two commodities with positive returns, driven by the booming electric vehicle (EV) market and global economic uncertainties, respectively. However, most commodities struggled due to weakening global manufacturing and demand. Investors, therefore, may want to closely monitor lithium and gold, while adopting a cautious stance toward other energy commodities as the world moves toward a greener future.</p>

    	<p>As nations seek to cut their carbon footprints, demand has surged for clean energy, fuelling the global competition to secure critical minerals for climate-friendly power sources like batteries. China has been laser-focused on the task.</p>
    	<p>After spending more than US$1 billion to acquire mining sites in Zimbabwe over the past two years, several Chinese-owned companies have now completed construction or upgrades of lithium processing plants. Observers said the new plants would help the country move up the mining value chain by processing - as well as mining - the metal while employing thousands of workers.</p>
      <p>Shanghai Stock Exchange-listed Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, China's Sinomine Resource Group, and Shenzhen-listed lithium materials producer Chengxin Lithium Group are three Chinese mining companies that have recently commissioned processing plants in Zimbabwe, which holds one of the world's largest hard-rock lithium reserves.</p>

      <p>Lithium - known as "white gold" - is an essential raw material for the lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles and in solar panels that store solar energy.</p>
      <p>Last week, Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe, a unit of the Chinese mining giant Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, formally commissioned a US$300 million lithium processing plant at the Arcadia hard-rock lithium mine.</p>
      <p>Located in the town of Goromonzi, 80km (49 miles) southeast of Harare, the facility has a processing capacity of 4.5 million tonnes of hard-rock lithium, which translates into around 400,000 tonnes of concentrate per year for export.</p>
      <p>While commissioning the processing facility last week, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the plant would boost the government's ambitious target of generating US$12 billion in revenue from the mining sector by the end of this year, up from about US$5.6 billion of mineral exports in 2022. Lithium mining was expected to generate about US$500 million.</p>
      <p>"Investment will promote the value addition of lithium ore. Lithium is the mineral of the present and future. Its beneficiation [for smelting] will position our country to be a competitive player in lithium production," said Mnangagwa, who was elected president in 2018 after a military coup and is seeking a second term in office. Mnangagwa said he appreciated the investment and support from China, and was looking forward to more.</p>	
      <p>Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said mining cooperation between the two countries had good momentum and broad prospects. "Chinese mining companies have made better use of Zimbabwe's mineral resources, making Zimbabwe an important link in the international new energy industry chain," Zhou said at the Arcadia launch.</p>
      <p>Huayou Cobalt bought the Arcadia operation from Australian-listed Prospect Resources and Zimbabwean minority stakes in 2021 for US$422 million. It invested US$300 million to develop the mine to expand production for the electric vehicle (EV) market. It is currently producing the lithium concentrates spodumene and petalite for export to China for further processing into lithium chemicals for making batteries.</p>
      <p>Last year, Zimbabwe banned exports of raw lithium ore, forcing companies to set up local factories to process ore into concentrates before export.</p>
      <p>The recent global rush to lithium has improved Zimbabwe's economic fortunes, with several Chinese companies making multimillion-dollar acquisitions to secure lithium supplies.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is believed to hold Africa's largest lithium reserves, the fifth largest in the world. The resource had remained largely untapped, however, because of a lack of investment in the country, which two decades ago was slapped with Western sanctions over human rights violations and the seizure of land from white farmers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another firm, China's Sinomine Resource Group's Zimbabwe lithium unit, has just completed building a spodumene concentrate plant at its Bikita minerals site, with a total price tag of US$300 million for expansion and exploration.</p>
      <p>Last year, Sinomine bought Bikita, the country's oldest lithium mines, for US$180 million with the aim of producing spodumene concentrate and petalite, which is used in the ceramics and glass industries.</p>
      <p>The plant will produce 300,000 tonnes of chemical grade spodumene concentrate annually for export once the Bikita project reaches its full production capacity.</p>
      <p>Sinomine expects to upgrade petalite production to 480,000 tonnes per year from the previous annual rate of 50,000 tonnes.</p>
      <p>In May, another Chinese company, Chengxin Lithium Group, commissioned a 300,000 tonne per year lithium concentrator at the Sabi Star mine in eastern Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Chris Berry, president of ­commodities advisory firm House Mountain Partners in New York, said for the energy transition to continue and lithium supplies to begin to approach demand in the coming years, Africa would need to become a more significant source of lithium.</p>
      <p>"The Chinese have realised this and that's why projects in Zimbabwe and Mali are moving forward," Berry said. Ghana could join the ranks of lithium-producing countries in the next few years as well, he added.</p>
      <p>"Lithium is not rare [in Africa or elsewhere], but producing commercial quantities of battery grade material is the challenge. As Chinese capital has a tougher time finding a home in Western projects, it would seem that African lithium projects are a natural fit."</p>
      <p>Adam Megginson, a price analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said there were only a handful of lithium mines operating in Zimbabwe, but announcements of new projects and project expansions continued, especially from Chinese miners, lithium converters and conglomerates.</p>
      <p>"Overall we forecast Zimbabwe's mined supply to increase 250 per cent from limited current volumes to 2025 as more capacity comes online from the country," Megginson said.</p>
      <p>But even if it meets those projections, he said Zimbabwe would only account for less than 3 per cent of global mined supply by then.</p>
    	<p>Megginson said Zimbabwe's ban on unrefined lithium exports had encouraged a build in the concentration capacity of spodumene and petalite ore before export, but it had yet to spur the construction of refining capacity for carbonate and hydroxide, which are refined lithium chemicals required to make lithium-ion batteries.</p>	
    	<p>"We don't expect Zimbabwe to have any lithium [refining] chemicals capacity by 2025. So it will continue to rely on other countries, primarily China, to process material into battery grade carbonate and hydroxide required for use in batteries," Megginson said.</p>

    	<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Falling crude oil prices and lingering worries about the global economy have been sapping power from energy stocks throughout 2023.</p>
    	<p>The sector, which includes oil and oilfield exploration companies, is coming off of two years or rising oil prices and inflation.</p>	
    	<p>Now the S&P 500 has broken free from the bear market, but the energy sector is among the biggest laggards with a 7.4% dip.</p>	
    	<p>“Given that energy is one of the most cyclical sectors in the market, ongoing fears of a slowdown both here and abroad are likely weighing on the price of oil and energy stocks,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, in a note to investors.</p>
      <p>Exxon Mobil is down 5% and oilfield services company Halliburton is down 8.4% this year. Falling crude oil and natural gas prices have been among the biggest drags on the sector.</p>
      <p>Oil prices have fallen 8% in the U.S. and natural gas prices slumped 36%. Prices have been falling as economic growth slows and that could remain the trend this year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects weaker energy consumption in 2023 and 2024.</p>
      <p>That could mean energy companies will continue to struggle with earnings over the next few quarters. Analysts polled by FactSet expect profits to slip by nearly 50% for the sector in the second quarter, followed by a 34% drop in the third quarter and a 27% drop in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>It marks a reversal from 2022, when some of the biggest names in the sector notched record profits amid rising oil and natural gas prices. Exxon Mobil reported $55 billion in profit in 2022, more than double what it earned in 2021. The company recently warned investors that lower gas prices and weaker demand could pinch margins and profits by billions of dollars. Shell has also warned Wall Street about weakened profits during the most recent quarter.</p>
      <p>Energy companies are expected to notch the biggest profit declines within the S&P 500. The broader S&P 500 is expected to pull out of its profit slump in the latter half of the year.</p>
      <p>The weak energy market has been bad for investors, but good for consumers, so far. Lower crude oil prices have eased pressure on inflation, which has been cooling for months. Gasoline costs, normally an unavoidable expense for most people, have fallen about 25% from a year ago, according to AAA.</p>
      <p>The impact from lower gasoline prices goes beyond simply relieving pressure on inflation and could be a bulwark against a recession and benefit economic growth.</p>
      <p>“In a time when we worry about the ability of consumer spending to drive growth, the less consumers have to spend on energy, the more they can spend on other things,” Young said.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil headed for a third weekly gain as supply disruptions in Africa and a reduction in shipments from Russia tightened the market.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate futures traded near $77 a barrel, up around 4% this week, even as they fluctuated Friday. Protesters shut a major Libyan oil field, Sharara, after output from the smaller El Feel field was already halted Thursday.</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, flows from the Forcados oil terminal in Nigeria have been suspended to check for a possible leak. That follows signs that resilient Russian flows are finally starting to decline, four months after the country was due to slash output.</p>	
    	<p>Crude prices remain marginally lower this year, and the International Energy Agency said Thursday that global demand won’t grow as fast as previously expected in 2023 — although it still sees record consumption. The market is expected to tighten in the second half, aided by supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p>
      <p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries expects an even tighter global oil market next year, a view more bullish than those of other forecasters. World oil demand will climb by 2.2 million barrels a day to reach 104.3 million a day, OPEC said on Thursday in its first detailed assessment of 2024.</p>
      <p>“There’s a big underlying story about lower inflationary pressure in the US and also in Europe,” which is helping to buoy prices, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of research at A/S Global Risk Management Ltd. “However, lower inflation could push up commodity prices and we might end up in a situation where inflationary pressure comes back.”</p>
      <p>Traders will closely watch for the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates, as well as a potential response among G-7 policy makers after prices for Russian crude surged over their cap, said Rasmussen.</p>
      <p>While the oil balance looks tight for the remainder of the year, “from a technical point of view the market is likely to face some strong resistance at the 200-day moving average,” said Warren Patterson, the Singapore-based head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV.</p>
      <p>The US benchmark has surpassed its 50- and 100-day moving averages in quick succession following recent gains, with prices near an 11-week high as physical market supply disruptions hit futures. WTI hasn’t breached the 200-day threshold since August last year, although futures came close in April.</p>
      <p>“There’s a good chance we will break the 200-day moving average next week,” Rasmussen said.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Russia is about to surpass Saudi Arabia as the top oil producer in the OPEC+ cartel, according to the IEA.</li>
        <li>The agency estimated Saudi Arabia would produce just 9 million barrels per day of oil in July and August.</li>
        <li>The kingdom voluntarily slashed production by 1 million bpd and extended that cut through July.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Russia is about to surpass Saudi Arabia as the top OPEC+ oil producer, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
    	<p>In its monthly oil market report, the agency estimated Saudi Arabia's total crude production would fall to 9 million barrels a day through the months of July and August. That would be the lowest volume of oil the kingdom has produced in two years, the report said, which would cause it to slip below the ranks of Russia as the top oil producer in the OPEC+ cartel.</p>	
    	<p>The estimated drop largely stems from Saudi Arabia's voluntary oil production cut of 1 million barrels per day, which the nation said recently it would extend through the month of July in a bid to prop up crude prices.</p>	
    	<p>In June, Saudi Arabia produced 9.98 million barrels a day, and Russia produced 9.45 million barrels a day, according to IEA data.</p>
      <p>Russia also said earlier this month that it plans to curb output by 500,000 barrels per day starting in August. But its actual output has often exceeded the reduced levels it promised, setting Russia up to potentially pump more than Saudia Arabia.</p>
      <p>In fact, Saudi officials have complained that Russia isn't following through with its promised cuts, as its weakened economy is adding pressure to keep energy revenues afloat. In May, that caused the price of oil to fall below $81 a barrel, a key breakeven level for Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Riyadh has worked to push oil prices higher for months, with the nation's energy chief citing market "distortions" that are keeping prices low. That led OPEC+ to issue a series of aggressive production cuts last year and Saudi Arabia's first voluntary cut in June.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Russian oil exports slumped in June to the lowest volume since 2021, suggesting that its crude production may finally have dipped as well, after months of robust exports earlier this year.</p>

    	<p>The Sharara deposit in the southwest of the country will gradually halt production, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The shutdown follows a stoppage at Libya’s El Feel field, which was also targeted by protesters.</p>	
    	<p>There was also disruption in Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa. That country’s Forcados oil terminal was stopped so that divers could inspect a possible leak, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude settled above $81 a barrel Thursday to reach an 11-week high. Libyan oil exports generally go to Spain, Italy and France, so a prolonged disruption could mean more West African crude moving into Northwest Europe, said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth.</p>
      <p>The outage comes as signs emerge that supply curbs from Saudi Arabia and Russia are starting to tighten the market, jolting oil futures for their recent torpor.</p>
      <p>Sharara and the Waha field, which is further east, pump similar amounts of oil. Before the disruption, Sharara was at about 250,000 to 260,000 barrels a day, and Waha was at about 290,000 barrels a day.</p>

    	<p>MUMBAI (Reuters) -India on Wednesday restricted imports on plain gold jewellery, as the world's second-largest consumer of the precious metal tries to plug loopholes in its trade policy.</p>
    	<p>Import of articles of gold have been put under the restriction category from the free category, a government notification said, adding that import under the India-United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement would be allowed without any license.</p>	
    	<p>The Ministry of Commerce and Industry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

      <p>"Indonesia was never a gold jewellery supplier to India, but in the last few months, bullion dealers imported 3-4 tonnes from Indonesia without paying any import taxes," said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank.</p>
      <p>India levies a 15% tax on gold imports.</p>
      <p>"Many dealers got to know about the loophole, and they were also trying to source from Indonesia. The policy change has closed that loophole," he said.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices edged higher on Tuesday as the dollar and bond yields fell ahead of U.S. inflation data that could offer more cues on the Federal Reserve's rate-hike path.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,931.83 per ounce by 02:11 p.m. EDT (1811 GMT), set for a third consecutive session of gains. U.S. gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,937.10.</p>	
    	<p>Making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, the dollar index fell 0.3% to its lowest level since May 11. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields also slipped. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>"If we have a soft inflation reading, it will be positive for gold and prices might go up to $1,950. I think it will be tough for gold to break below $1,900 level on a hot report," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.</p>
      <p>"Rate hikes are not going to break gold's back, but it might kill the economy. So there is some support for gold due to this reason."</p>
      <p>All eyes are on U.S. consumer prices data due on Wednesday, which is expected to show prices cooled on an annual basis in June.</p>
      <p>However, markets are pricing in a 25-basis-point rate hike from the Fed later this month after last week's jobs report pointed to a resilient U.S. economy. [FEDWATCH]</p>
      <p>Gold is used as a safe investment during times of political and financial uncertainty, but higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil dropped as light summer trading volumes exacerbated pressure from technical resistance levels.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate settled below $73 a barrel, putting a lid on last week’s supply-driven rally. The commodity briefly rose above its 100-day moving average on Friday, but the key level has since provided resistance to further gains. Meanwhile, brokers noted that trading flows remain thin, as is typical in the summer, which has kept price moves choppy.</p>	
    	<p>With the exception of commodity trading advisers focusing on crude, oil trading has remained “extremely quiet” resulting in a market that’s “defenseless to the flows seen on a daily basis and keeping volatility quite high despite a lack of interest,” said Scott Shelton, an energy specialist at ICAP.</p>	
    	<p>Adding to bearish sentiment was Chinese data revealing its economy is on the brink of deflation, while miner Rio Tinto Group said it sees a host of near-term economic challenges in the nation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the risk of a US recession is “not completely off the table,” adding an element of caution to the market.</p>
      <p>Oil has been rangebound since late April, in part as China’s lackluster economic recovery and aggressive monetary tightening by central banks counter near-term tightness. A solid US employment report is keeping the Federal Reserve on track to boost interest rates this month, maintaining headwinds for crude prices. The International Energy Agency and OPEC will provide snapshots of the market when they release monthly reports later this week.</p>
      <p>The outlook remains mixed as the market flashes signs of strength and speculators cut their bearish bets on the global benchmark and West Texas Intermediate crude. Last week, Brent rose 4.8% following a pledge by Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce supply.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the US announced on Friday that it’s purchasing 6 million more barrels of crude for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as the nation continues to refill its supply buffer. The purchases, scheduled for October and November, come as the reserve is at its lowest point in 40 years.</p>

    	<p>HOUSTON (Reuters) -Oil prices eased 1% on Monday on the increasing likelihood of more U.S. interest rate hikes, but crude supply cuts from top oil exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia limited the losses.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures settled down 78 cents, or 1%, at $77.69 a barrel after touching their highest level in more than two months earlier in the session.</p>
      <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 87 cents, or 1.2%, at $72.99.</p>
      <p>"Traders are very nervous about higher interest rates, which could kill demand very quickly," said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial, adding that some investors were also engaging in profit-taking after last week's gains.</p>
      <p>Both benchmarks rose more than 4.5% last week after Saudi Arabia and Russia announced fresh output cuts bringing total reductions by the OPEC+ group to around 5 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 5% of global oil demand.</p>
      <p>San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Monday repeated that she believes two more rate hikes this year will likely be needed to bring down inflation that is still too high, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester also signaled more rate rises.</p>
      <p>Higher interest rates could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Labor Department reported last Friday the smallest monthly job gain in 2-1/2 years along with strong wage growth. The data strengthened the likelihood that the Fed would raise interest rates at its meeting later this month.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China's factory gate prices fell at the fastest pace in more than seven years in June, according to government data, indicating a slowdown in the recovery in the world's second-largest economy.</p>
      <p>However, oil demand from China and developing countries, combined with OPEC+ supply cuts, is likely to keep the market tight in the second half of the year despite a sluggish global economy, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.</p>
      <p>Markets are also focusing on the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index data, a key inflation report, and a slew of economic reports from China later this week to ascertain demand.</p>

    	<p>West Texas Intermediate settled near $74, the highest in over a month, supported by risk-on sentiment on Friday. Crude posted its first back-to-back weekly increase since May, with near-term time spreads flipping into a narrow backwardated structure, a bullish pricing pattern.</p>	
    	<p>Saudi Arabia set large price increases for its crude to Europe and the Mediterranean after announcing an extension into August of its unilateral 1-million-barrel-a-day supply cut. The costlier Saudi grades are pushing refineries across the Atlantic Basin to seek alternatives, causing the price of Norway’s North Sea crude to surge.</p>	
    	<p>Crude remains down about 10% this year, with tighter monetary policy, China’s lackluster recovery, and resilient Russian exports pressuring futures. This week’s price rise came despite a broad move lower in other risk assets, as robust US jobs numbers reinforced bets the Federal Reserve will keep hiking interest rates.</p>
      <p>US job gains slowed last month, according to data released Friday, but wage growth remained strong, reinforcing expectations of interest rate hikes.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Technology has been a big winner this year, but this beaten-down part of the market is showing signs of life.</p>
    	<p>Markets started out Friday morning with some volatility, as investors tried to parse through the latest employment report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to figure out the implications for the economy and monetary policy going forward.</p>	
	    <p>In particular, many market participants have appeared to be spooked by concerns that the Federal Reserve could boost interest rates higher and keep them at elevated levels longer than previously thought. Yet by early afternoon, major indexes were all higher on the day.</p>	
    	<p>Given the market's performance, it would be natural to assume that red-hot technology stocks were helping to lead the charge higher. However, on Friday, it was the beaten-down energy sector that posted the strongest gains. Below, you'll learn more about what's happening in energy and whether now's the time to take a closer look at the sector.</p>
      <h3>How energy rebounded on Friday</h3>
      <p>There was a lot of interest in energy stocks across the market on Friday. The relatively broad-based Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEMKT: XLE) led its sector-focused counterparts with gains of nearly 3% early Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The obvious catalyst for the move was a rise in crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate climbed by almost $1.50 per barrel, or 2%, to $73.25. Brent crude saw similar percentage gains, with prices approaching the $78 per barrel mark. However, investors on the natural gas side of the sector weren't as fortunate, as August contracts for natural gas were down 2% on the day.</p>
      <p>A big portion of the gains among stocks within the sector came from the oilfield equipment and services arena. Big players including SLB (SLB 8.61%) and Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) enjoyed gains of 7% to 8%. That was enough to outpace most of the major integrated oil giants that investors follow most closely, although smaller exploration and production companies like Tellurian (NYSEMKT: TELL) and HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ: HPK) managed to climb by 8% to 9%.</p>
      <p>Drilling companies also did relatively well. Transocean (NYSE: RIG) climbed 7%, while Diamond Offshore Drilling (NYSE: DO) and Noble Corp. (NYSE: NE) were both up 6%. Higher oil prices support more expensive drilling operations offshore, and that's a big part of how drilling companies stay profitable.</p>
      <h3>Moving downstream</h3>
      <p>Also seeing gains were shares of oil refining companies. Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: MPC) led the way higher with gains of nearly 5%. However, other major players also saw reasonably strong moves higher, with HF Sinclair (NYSE: DINO) picking up 3.5% and Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) enjoying a 2.5% rise.</p>
      <p>Refiners have enjoyed relatively wide spreads between the cost they pay for crude oil and the prices they receive for refined energy products for quite a while now. Favorable price action continued on Friday, as unleaded gasoline futures moved higher by 1.5%, or $0.04 per gallon, to $2.584. Diesel prices climbed even more sharply, reflecting continued high demand from commercial users even amid macroeconomic pressures.</p>
      <h3>Is energy back?</h3>
      <p>It's unclear whether the latest move higher in energy stocks will prove fleeting or lasting. Supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia have helped to build a more supportive environment for oil prices, but signs of a potential economic slowdown in the U.S. could lead to questions about demand in the short run.</p>
      <p>Many energy stocks have largely missed out on the bullish bounce across the broader market in the first half of 2023. If oil and natural gas prices can stop falling and build a more solid foundation, then it could be the signal investors are waiting to see to start investing in energy once again.</p>

    	<p>Iranian crude exports have hit a five-year high in recent months as the country ships more oil to China and other buyers</p>
    	<p>Iran’s oil exports have hit a five-year high in recent months as the country sells more to China and other countries, adding large volumes of discounted crude to a global energy market already struggling amid concerns over demand.</p>	
    	<p>The surge in Iran’s oil supply threatens to upend efforts by Saudi Arabia and other major crude producers to prop up prices by cutting output. Oil’s value has fallen by about a fifth since late last year on expectations of a slowing global economy and a glut of cheap Russian cargoes.</p>	
    	<p>It also shows how Iran is increasingly circumventing U.S. sanctions as the Biden administration quietly resumes talks with Tehran in a bid to win the release of American prisoners held by the Islamic Republic and curb its growing nuclear program.</p>
      <p>Iran’s oil shipments amounted to about 1.6 million barrels a day on average in June and May, according to commodity-data providers Kpler and Petro-Logistics, more than double the level of about a year ago and the highest since 2018, when the reimposition of U.S. sanctions caused a slump.</p>
      <p>While the scale and final destination of Iran’s oil sales are difficult to gauge, given their often covert nature, data from several firms monitoring the global energy trade indicate that China remains its top customer.</p>
      <p>Beijing directly imported 359,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil in May, up from about 266,000 barrels in the same month last year, according to Kpler. Industry watchers say Iran’s actual sales to China are likely much higher and include oil transshipped through other Asian and Middle Eastern countries.</p>
      <p>China has long said it doesn’t follow U.S. sanctions on Iran but has rarely disclosed data on oil imports from the Islamic Republic since Washington reimposed sanctions on the country.</p>
      <p>Among the other top buyers of Iranian crude are Syria and Venezuela, both of which are under American sanctions. Iran is also seeing growing interest for its oil from other buyers in Latin America and Africa, Iranian traders say.</p>
      <p>Iranian oil officials say the country is offering a discount of about $30 a barrel compared with its Persian Gulf rivals, including Saudi Arabia, allowing it to compete with cheap Russian oil.</p>
      <p>For China, the supply of crude from Iran and Russia has allowed Beijing to hoard cheap oil as insurance in case the economy kicks into a higher gear and crude prices rise. Beijing added about 1.77 million barrels a day to its inventories in May, the most since July 2020, according to oil-data-analytics firm Refinitiv Eikon.</p>
      <p>Iran is a member of the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries but its output quota within the cartel is suspended due to the U.S. sanctions. As it ships more oil, Tehran is undermining Riyadh’s attempts to keep prices higher by limiting production.</p>
      <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has fallen about 20% since OPEC and its Russia-led allies, called OPEC+, first jolted the market in October by slashing output by 2 million barrels a day. In April, some of the group’s largest members, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, cut a further 1.6 million barrels a day.</p>
      <p>Last month, Saudi Arabia said it would cut 1 million barrels of oil a day from its July output after other OPEC+ members agreed to stick to current production targets until the end of the year. Earlier this week, Riyadh extended that cut to August. Saudi Arabia needs oil above $80 a barrel, by some analysts’ estimates, to fund its expansive economic program.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Iran in May said it had boosted its crude output to more than 3 million barrels a day, up from around 2.5 million barrels before the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.</p>
      <p>Iranian officials say the country, which re-established diplomatic relations with regional rival Saudi Arabia in a deal mediated by China earlier this year, is taking advantage of Riyadh’s output cut by filling that gap and feeding Beijing’s increasing appetite for cheap oil.</p>
      <p>Iran, for which oil is the biggest source of foreign currency, earned $28 billion from crude sales in the Persian calendar year, which ended in March 2023, almost four times more than in 2021, according to former Iranian central banker Abdolnaser Hemmati. The cash is providing Iran a lifeline for its economy, which has been battered by high inflation and a tumbling currency.</p>
      <p>Iran’s growing oil exports potentially give it more leverage amid the latest attempt at diplomacy between Washington and Tehran. While the Biden administration appears focused on cooling tensions, which have soared this year, it is unlikely to make substantial concessions as the presidential campaign approaches.</p>
      <p>Besides oil, Iran is also selling other hydrocarbon products. For instance, India and Kenya have been scooping up dozens of cargoes of Iranian asphalt, according to Kpler and Iranian oil traders. India’s Petroleum Ministry and the Kenyan Ministry of Trade didn’t return requests for comment.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose as traders weighed Saudi Arabian and Russian production cuts after a slew of low-volume trading sessions.</p>
    	<p>The two OPEC+ linchpins announced their latest batch of curbs on Monday, with a supply-cut extension by Riyadh and a fresh pledge to reduce production from Moscow. Brent settled above $76 a barrel while WTI rallied, catching up with the global benchmark after a US holiday on Tuesday.</p>	
    	<p>Brent’s prompt spread — the gap between the two nearest contracts — is back in a bullish, backwardated structure. The move is in line with traders repricing their expectations for near-term inventory draws on the horizon, said Daniel Ghali, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.</p>	
    	<p>“Speculative short covering has likely provided some support to prices, but fundamentally our gauge of supply risk is printing its highest levels year-to-date,” Ghali said. “Saudi Arabia’s decision to rollover its voluntary production cuts and Russia’s decision to curtail exports, as opposed to production, are the fundamental factors contributing to recent gains.”</p>
      <p>The UAE won’t be joining voluntary oil cuts at this time, the country’s energy minister said. Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Russia’s latest oil cut is meaningful as it will affect exports.</p>
      <p>Crude has slumped this year amid China’s stuttering economic recovery and after central banks in the US and Europe raised rates to quell inflation, jeopardizing energy demand.</p>
      <p>There have also been pockets of fundamental strength in recent days. Kazakhstan’s CPC crude has faced disruption as a result of power outages in the country. Separately, one refiner in Germany is limiting diesel supplies, a sign of regional supply tightness.</p>

    	<p>Investors are understandably disappointed when a stock they own declines in value. But it's hard to avoid some disappointing investments when the overall market is down.</p>
    	<p>The Silver Elephant Mining Corp. (TSE:ELEF) is down 90% over three years, but the total shareholder return is 560% once you include the dividend. And that total return actually beats the market return of 48%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 46% in the last year.</p>	
    	<p>Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 30% in the last 90 days. We really hope anyone holding through that price crash has a diversified portfolio. Even when you lose money, you don't have to lose the lesson.</p>	
    	<p>So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.</p>
      <p>Silver Elephant Mining hasn't yet reported any revenue, so it's as much a business idea as an actual business. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. For example, they may be hoping that Silver Elephant Mining finds fossil fuels with an exploration program, before it runs out of money.</p>
      <p>We think companies that have neither significant revenues nor profits are pretty high risk. There was already a significant chance that they would need more money for business development, and indeed they recently put themselves at the mercy of capital markets and raised equity.</p>
      <p>So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies go on to make revenue, profits, and generate value, others get hyped up by hopeful naifs before eventually going bankrupt. Silver Elephant Mining has already given some investors a taste of the bitter losses that high risk investing can cause.</p>
      <p>Silver Elephant Mining had liabilities exceeding cash when it last reported, according to our data. That made it extremely high risk, in our view. But with the share price diving 24% per year, over 3 years , it's probably fair to say that some shareholders no longer believe the company will succeed or they are worried about dilution with the recent cash injection.</p>
      <p>It can be extremely risky to invest in a company that doesn't even have revenue. There's no way to know its value easily. Would it bother you if insiders were selling the stock? I would feel more nervous about the company if that were so. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.</p>
      <h3>What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?</h3>
      <p>We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Silver Elephant Mining's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders.</p>
      <p>Silver Elephant Mining hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of 560% exceeds its share price return of -90%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.</p>
      <h3>A Different Perspective</h3>
      <p>Investors in Silver Elephant Mining had a tough year, with a total loss of 46%, against a market gain of about 8.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 61%, each year, over five years.</p>
      <p>If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Silver Elephant Mining (2 make us uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.</p>
      <p>Silver Elephant Mining is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold firmed on Tuesday as some traders bet that recent weak U.S. economic data may prompt the Federal Reserve to rethink its rate hike trajectory, while also positioning for further cues from the minutes of the central bank's last meeting.</p>
      <p>Spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,929.54 per ounce by 0954 GMT, with trading volume likely thinned by a U.S. holiday.</p>
    	<p>U.S. gold futures gained 0.4% to $1,937.20.</p>	
    	<p>"Weaker than expected U.S. economic data released on Monday, including PMIs, have supported gold. Market participants will closely track upcoming U.S. job market data, watching if previous U.S. interest rate hikes will slow down the U.S. economy," UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.</p>
      <p>But the minutes of the Fed's June meeting on Wednesday could "sound hawkish in line with the recent testimony of Jerome Powell," Staunovo added.</p>
      <p>Investors see a nearly 90% chance of a 25-basis-point hike in July, according to CME's Fedwatch tool. High rates discourage investment in zero-yield gold.</p>
      <p>Focus this week will also be on non-farm payrolls data, after U.S. manufacturing slumped in June.</p>
      <p>"Right now, headwinds for gold are expectations of a further 50 bps tightening, more liquidity withdrawal and rates remaining relatively elevated for some time," said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets, ABC Refinery.</p>
      <p>Also on the radar were fresh developments in the U.S.-China trade war, with Beijing restricting exports of some metals used in semiconductors, electric vehicles and high-tech industries.</p>
      <p>Previous flare-ups also benefited the U.S. dollar, reducing demand for gold. [USD/]</p>
      <p>Spot silver rose 0.6% to $23.0094 per ounce, and palladium jumped 1.5% to $1,247.14. Platinum climbed 1.5% to $919.79, set for a third consecutive session of rise if gains hold.</p>
      <p>"The white metals remain linked to the performance of gold. That said, economic growth concerns have a bigger impact as those metals (which) have a higher industrial usage than gold," Staunovo said.</p>

    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Tuesday as markets weighed supply cuts for August by top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia against the backdrop of an uncertain global economic outlook.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures climbed 32 cents, or 0.42%, to $75.73 a barrel by 0805 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $70.96 a barrel, up 32 cents, or 0.45%.</p>	
    	<p>On Monday, Saudi Arabia said it would extend its voluntary output cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to August, while Russia and Algeria volunteered to lower their output and export levels for August by 500,000 bpd and 20,000 bpd respectively.</p>
      <p>If fully implemented, that will lead to a combined reduction of 5.36 million bpd versus August 2022 levels - possibly even more as several member countries are unable to fulfil their quotas, said PVM analyst Tamas Varga.</p>
      <p>However, oil benchmarks settled down about 1% in the previous session, after an initial rally, on the back of a gloomy macroeconomic outlook.</p>
      <p>Business surveys have shown a slump in global factory activity because of sluggish demand in China and Europe and U.S. manufacturing also fell further in June - reaching levels last seen in the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>This broader uncertainty will likely overshadow the OPEC+ effort to tighten supply, some analysts said.</p>
      <p>Combined with expectations of higher U.S. interest rates and fears that the U.S. will join the EU in recession, this will continue to weigh on markets, Eurasia Group analysts said.</p>
      <p>Despite the best efforts of Saudi Arabia and Russia, said Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, "the days may be over for oil prices to jump back above the 90 price mark, and the prices are more likely to consolidate between the 65 and 70 price ranges."</p>
      <p>U.S. markets will be closed on Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday.</p>

        <li>Russia and Saudi Arabia vowed to keep slashing oil production through the summer.</li>

    	<p>Russia and Saudi Arabia have vowed to extend their oil production cuts through the summer, leading crude prices to inch higher as energy markets braced for tighter supply.</p>
    	<p>Russia will voluntarily slash its oil production by half a million barrels a day starting in August, deputy prime minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.</p>	
    	<p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which already slashed production by a million barrels a day in July, has said it would extend its production cut through August, according to a statement from the nation's press agency.</p>	
    	<p>Oil prices inched higher on Monday as markets assessed the supply outlook. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1% to trade at $76.03 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has worked to push crude prices higher for months, with the nation's energy chief citing market "distortions" that have sent prices to artificially low levels. OPEC+, the oil cartel which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of, slashed its crude production aggressively through last year, before Saudi Arabia began its own voluntary production cuts this summer to further tighten supply and raise prices.</p>
      <p>The country has also aired its displeasure with Russia, which has worked to keep its energy revenue afloat under Western sanctions by selling vast amounts of cheap crude to mostly Asian customers.</p>
      <p>In May, Saudi officials accused Russia of not following through with promised OPEC+ production cuts, the Wall Street Journal reported. That caused oil prices to fall under $81 a barrel, a key break-even level that's needed to fund large swaths of Saudi Arabia's economy.</p>
      <p>But both nations recently doubled-down on their resolve to boost oil prices together, with Novak stating in a June meeting that Russia would adhere to the 1.4 million barrel-a-day cut imposed on OPEC+ members in April. Russia will carry those production cuts through the end of 2024, Novak added</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- China’s coal buyers should slow purchases from abroad to avoid hurting domestic suppliers, the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association has recommended.</p>
    	<p>Asia’s largest economy imported 182 million tons of the fuel in the first five months of the year, almost 90% more than the same period in 2022, customs data show. The purchases were driven by the prospect of a hotter-than-usual summer, Beijing’s determination to minimize blackouts, and a drop in seaborne coal prices.</p>	
    	<p>Profits at local coal miners, meanwhile, fell by almost a fifth in the first five months from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics show. That could worsen in coming months, given that Chinese prices peaked in early September last year amid global energy shortages following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>	
    	<p>The CCTD is concerned about the growing impact on domestic coal miners, suggesting in a statement on the weekend that companies “control the scale and pace” of imports after an industry summit last week. Power plants, sitting on high inventories, have turned down some term volumes from local miners, suggesting that overall supply may remain ample in the second half, the association said.</p>
      <p>The price of coal at Newcastle in Australia, the benchmark for seaborne supplies, is now about a third of what it was in early September. While prices of Chinese coal have also fallen, the premium buyers must pay for seaborne fuel dropped to around $13.50 a ton a month ago, making the imports more attractive. It can take up to a month for coal to be shipped to China, depending on where it’s coming from.</p>
      <p>The jump in imports has also been driven by geopolitical factors. China is taking more of the fuel from Russia, and also from Australia after an informal ban on buying was lifted earlier in the year following an easing of diplomatic tensions.</p>
      <p>And, while sweltering temperatures will boost demand from electricity generators, that may be partially offset by less industrial consumption as the post-virus recovery continues to disappoint. Heavy rain in southern China is also boosting hydropower output.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- China is on a natural gas shopping spree, and officials are happy for importers to keep striking deals even after a global energy crisis has eased.</p>
    	<p>The government continues to back efforts by state-owned buyers to sign long-term contracts and even invest in export facilities, in order to bolster energy security through the middle of the century, according to people who have had meetings with policymakers.</p>	  
    	<p>The nation is on track to be the world’s top importer of liquefied natural gas in 2023. And for the third straight year, Chinese companies are agreeing to buy more of it on a long-term basis than any single nation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.</p>	
    	<p>China is looking well into the future to avoid a repeat of energy shortages, while also seeking to fuel economic growth. Long-term LNG contracts are attractive because shipments are promised at a relatively steady price compared to the spot market, where gas surged to an all-time after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“Energy security has always been a priority for China,” said Toby Copson, global head of trading and advisory at Trident LNG in Shanghai. “Having ample supply in their portfolio allows them to manage future volatility. I would expect to see more.”</p>
      <p>The dealmaking efforts will help underpin global export projects, strengthening the role the seaborne fuel will play in the energy mix. And as suppliers move to woo Chinese importers, Beijing’s influence in the market is set to increase.</p>
      <p>China began its push for long-term contracts in 2021, after relations with the US improved. While imports dipped last year partly due to weaker demand amid Covid restrictions, Chinese buyers renewed the drive after the invasion of Ukraine cut pipeline gas to Europe.</p>
      <p>The resulting high prices and global competition for the super-chilled fuel provided a quick lesson in the need for stable supplies. Part of China’s push for energy security is to diversify imports among various countries as a cushion against further geopolitical disruptions.</p>
      <p>Several other importers, including India, are also looking to sign more deals to avoid future shortages and curb dependence on spot deliveries, yet China is locking in contracts at a much faster pace. So far this year, 33% of long-term LNG volumes signed went to China, according to Bloomberg calculations.</p>
      <p>In the last month, state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. sealed a 27-year deal with Qatar and took a stake in the exporter’s massive expansion project, while ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. inked a decades-spanning contract with US developer Cheniere Energy Inc. Supplies from both contracts are slated to begin as soon as 2026.</p>
      <p>More deals are in the offing as negotiations span boardrooms from Singapore to Houston. State-owned giants including Cnooc Ltd. and Sinopec are in discussions with the US, while smaller firms such as Zhejiang Provincial Energy Group Co. and Beijing Gas Group Co. are also searching for deals, according to traders. Qatar is in talks with several Chinese buyers for sales contracts that could last more than 20 years, the traders said.</p>
      <p>The deals will help feed the roughly dozen new import terminals that are slated to start construction across China’s coastal cities in this decade. The nation’s LNG imports could rise to as high as 138 million tons by 2033, about double current levels, according to Norwegian consultant Rystad Energy.</p>
      <p>“Currently, over half of China’s LNG demand from 2030 to 2050 remains uncontracted,” said Xi Nan, a Rystad analyst.</p>
      <p>The government isn’t forcing companies to sign deals, and traders will only ink agreements that have attractive prices, the traders said. Chinese buyers are also using the new LNG contracts to expand portfolios and unlock lucrative trading opportunities.</p>
      <p>The bullish demand outlook isn’t certain, however, especially as China boosts gas production at home, while overland shipments from Russia could rise if new pipelines are constructed. An excess of supply increases the risk that LNG import terminals are likely to sit idle more frequently, Cnooc senior analyst Xie Xuguang warned last month.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, power outages and shortages over the last few years have changed the thinking of China’s policymakers, who now favor energy security over fuel importers facing a possible oversupply, according to traders who are briefed on the government’s strategy.</p>
      <p>A lack of coal — China’s mainstay fuel for power generation — triggered widespread electricity curtailments to factories for brief periods in 2021 and 2022, slowing economic growth. In response, the country vowed to increase mining capacity, and production has risen to record levels, keeping storage sites well stocked and reducing imports.</p>
      <p>Now, policymakers want to do the same with gas. Beijing is pushing the energy giants to also lift gas production at home, cutting drilling costs to increase self-sufficiency, according to people close to the government.</p>
      <p>“Given that new pipelines are being discussed but have yet to be finalized, Chinese buyers are still looking to secure supplies” from the LNG market, said Michal Meidan, head of China Energy Research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.</p>
      <p>Plus, the more deals China signs, the more control the nation has over global LNG supply. China is already playing a key role in balancing the market, reselling its contracted shipment to the neediest buyers when demand at home is weak, with that trend set to expand as the new deals start this decade.</p>
      <p>“Larger and more established buyers typically possess greater negotiation power compared to smaller or emerging players,” said Rystad’s Xi. “Continuing to sign long-term contracts is a logical decision.”</p>

    	<p>By Laura Sanicola</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) -Oil prices settled higher on Friday but posted their fourth straight quarterly loss as investors worried that sluggish global economic activity could crimp fuel demand.</p>	
    	<p>Benchmark Brent crude futures for August delivery which expires on Friday, settled up 56 cents, or 0.8%, at $74.90. In the three months to the end of June, the contract finished down 6%.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled up 78 cents, or 1.1% at $70.64 a barrel. It posted its second straight quarterly drop, down about 6.5% in the latest three months.</p>
      <p>Prices have been under pressure from rising interest rates in key economies and a slower than expected recovery in Chinese manufacturing and consumption.</p>
      <p>Signs of strengthening U.S. economic activity and sharp declines in U.S. oil inventories last week offered some support.</p>
      <p>For the day, crude was bolstered by a U.S. Commerce Department report showing annual inflation rising last month at its slowest pace in two years.</p>
      <p>Signs of moderating inflation "could hold the Federal Reserve off rising interest rates again," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.</p>
      <p>The market was also supported by upward revisions in demand for crude oil and refined products in the United States.</p>
      <p>Demand for crude and petroleum products fell slightly to 20.446 million bpd in April but remained seasonally strong, EIA data showed.</p>
      <p>Prices also drew support from Saudi Arabia's plans to cut output by a further 1 million barrels per day in July in addition to a broader OPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024.</p>
      <p>"Despite the announcements of two fresh rounds of cuts from OPEC+/Saudi Arabia, crude prices have largely remained below $80 a barrel as the market has been driven less by fundamentals and more by macroeconomic concerns," HSBC analysts said in a note.</p>
      <p>"We think this will continue to be the case for part of the summer, although the deep deficit of around 2.3 million barrels forecast for 2H23 should help to spur some upwards price momentum."</p>
      <p>A Reuters survey of 37 economists and analysts showed oil prices will struggle for traction this year as global economic headwinds linger.</p>
      <p>U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a ninth week in a row for the first time since July 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Traditionally regarded as a safe haven asset, gold often sees a surge in demand during periods of economic uncertainty. This is because the yellow metal’s value is not directly tied to any single economy, so it’s relatively immune to country-specific volatility. With its universal appeal and limited supply, gold tends to hold its value and even appreciate when other markets falter.</p>
    	<p>However, as is the case with every financial instrument, trading gold in volatile times requires a well-thought-out strategy and a keen understanding of the market’s inner workings.</p>	
    	<p>Consequently, this article will dive into five key strategies for gold traders to consider during times of turbulence, providing insights into navigating the complexities of one of the most popular markets amid heightened volatility.</p>	
    	<p>Before we jump in, though, a brief note. This article will be most useful for traders who trade the price of gold, rather than invest in gold bullions, so all the strategies are written with that in mind.</p>
      <h3>Strategy 1: Trend Following</h3>
      <p>Trend following is the most basic strategy for trading gold during volatile market conditions, so it serves as a perfect starting point. This approach uses technical analysis, such as moving averages, to align trades with the current market momentum.</p>
      <p>For instance, in a scenario where XAUUSD has been consistently rising from a level of $1800 to $1850 due to heightened market uncertainty, a trend follower would identify this as an uptrend and initiate a long position, aiming to profit from the continued rise. This strategy requires traders to regularly review and adjust their positions to reflect evolving market trends.</p>
      <h3>Strategy 2: Hedging</h3>
      <p>Hedging is a defensive strategy often employed by traders to shield their portfolios from potential losses during periods of market volatility. Gold, typically inversely correlated with equities, serves as an ideal hedge.</p>
      <p>For example, if a trader holds a substantial position in a stock index like the S&P 500 and anticipates a downturn, they might decide to open some gold positions as a protective measure.</p>
      <p>Suppose the S&P 500 drops by 2%, causing a trader’s portfolio to lose value. Simultaneously, let’s imagine heightened market anxiety drives investors to safe-haven assets, pushing XAUUSD up from $1800 to $1840.</p>
      <p>Potential profits from gold positions can help offset the losses from the declining stock market, stabilizing the overall portfolio value.</p>
      <h3>Strategy 3: Dollar-Cost Averaging</h3>
      <p>Dollar-cost averaging is a measured investment strategy in which a trader commits a fixed amount of money to open positions on gold at set intervals.</p>
      <p>Suppose a trader decides to allocate $1000 to trade XAUUSD every month. If XAUUSD is at $1800 at the start of the month, and the trader predicts a price surge, they would open a long position. If they’re correct, and the price increases to $1850 by the end of the month, they gain a significant profit.</p>
      <p>If in the next month the price drops to $1750, they would use the same $1000 to open a short position, expecting the price to decrease further. If that prediction turns out to be true, they profit from the downturn.</p>
      <p>This approach averages out the investment cost over time and reduces the impact of short-term volatility. Essentially, it’s a disciplined, long-term strategy that mitigates the risks associated with timing the market, particularly during volatile periods.</p>
      <h3>Strategy 4: Breakout Trading</h3>
      <p>Breakout trading strategy is a proactive approach that enables traders to leverage sudden price swings in gold. This strategy involves closely monitoring predefined support or resistance levels and initiating a trade when the price of gold “breaks out” from this range.</p>
      <p>Consider a scenario where XAUUSD has been trading in a range between $1,800 and $1,820, with $1,800 acting as the support level and $1,820 as the resistance.</p>
      <p>Amid market volatility, if the price suddenly jumps to $1,825, it represents a breakout above the resistance level, indicating a potential new uptrend. A breakout trader would then enter a long position, hoping to profit from the anticipated further rise in price.</p>
      <h3>Strategy 5: Safe Haven Strategy</h3>
      <p>As the archetypal safe haven asset, gold often holds or even gains value amidst market volatility or economic downturns, making it a popular safety net for risk management. Traders looking to buffer their portfolios against possible losses in riskier assets often increase their gold holdings during tumultuous times.</p>
      <p>Consider a geopolitical scenario where tensions are rising, creating uncertainty in global markets. Stock markets may react negatively to the news, triggering a sell-off of riskier assets. In response, a trader, noticing these geopolitical events, might decide to increase their position in gold. If XAUUSD is trading at $1,800, the trader could buy additional gold, expecting its value to rise amidst the instability.</p>
      <p>As investors flock to safe-haven assets like gold, the increased demand could drive XAUUSD up to $1,850 or higher. In essence, this strategy requires staying attuned to world events and understanding their potential impact on market sentiment.</p>
      <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>Trading gold during times of market volatility can be a profitable pursuit if handled with strategic finesse. The strategies outlined above—trend following, hedging, dollar-cost averaging, breakout trading, and the safe haven strategy—offer distinct approaches for navigating market turbulence. It’s important, however, to remember that there’s no such thing as a guarantee in the financial markets.</p>
      <p>This goes for gold too. Even if it has been a reliable safe haven asset historically, effective gold trading involves a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, the ability to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, and robust risk management practices.</p>
      <p>It’s all one big balancing act. By deploying the above strategies wisely and maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, gold traders put themselves in the best position to achieve consistent results.</p>

    	<p>For Immediate Release</p>
    	<p>Chicago, IL – June 29, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Warrior Met Coal HCC, SunCoke Energy SXC and Hallador Energy Company HNRG.</p>	
    	<p>Industry: Coal</p>	
    	<p>The Zacks Coal industry stocks staged a rebound in 2022, courtesy of global demand and surging natural gas prices. In 2023, the demand for coal will suffer due to lesser coal utilization in the United States to produce electricity, planned retirement of coal units and the utilization of more renewable sources for electricity generation.</p>
      <p>The ongoing energy transition, with utility operators steadily phasing out coal units, will adversely impact the coal industry. Then again, the persisting conflict between Russia and Ukraine is creating fresh demand from coal-importing countries. Hence, coal export from the United States is expected to improve in 2023 from the year-ago level.</p>
      <p>Despite a drop in coal production, improving cost export volumes and low-cost coal production assets are likely to boost the prospects of Warrior Met Coal. Other coal stocks, SunCoke Energy and Hallador Energy Company, are expected to gain during this difficult phase of the coal industry.</p>
      <h3>About the Industry</h3>
      <p>The Zacks Coal industry comprises companies involved in the discovery and mining of coal. Coal is mined through the opencast or the underground method. The commodity is valued for its energy content and used worldwide to generate electricity and manufacture steel and cement. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report, the current U.S. estimated recoverable coal reserves are about 252 billion short tons, of which, about 58% is underground mineable coal. Given the current production rates, coal resources are likely to last many more years.</p>
      <p>Five states in the United States contribute nearly 70% of the yearly production and 60% of the coal production from surface mining. Per EIA, the demand for coal will decline due to the usage of more renewable assets and a gradual shutdown of coal-powered generation units, hurting the prospects of the coal industry.</p>
      <h3>3 Trends Likely to Impact the Coal Industry</h3>
      <p><strong>Despite Reliability Emission Policy to Hurt Coal Industry:</strong> The improvement in demand for coal is short-lived as the new environmental policy will target 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, which will significantly lower the demand for coal from the U.S. electricity space. Per EIA, coal-fired electricity generation would drop from 20% in 2022 to 16% in 2023 and remain the same in 2024. Unless utility operators invest heavily in pollution-control measures to reduce emissions from power plants, domestic coal usage will fall drastically.</p>
      <p>Coal industry operators should brace themselves for challenges as several electric utilities have decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 and completely cut down coal usage. Despite the emission, coal stocks are still relevant as the commodity is a reliable source of energy and ensures 24x7 electricity production from the generation units.</p>
      <p><strong>U.S. Coal Production Drops:</strong> Per EIA projection, coal production in the United States is expected to drop in 2023 and 2024 after showcasing an improvement in production volumes in the previous two years. EIA projects U.S. coal production to decline by 6% to about 560 million short tons (MMst) in 2023 and a further 14% to 480 MMst in 2024 due to the expected reduction in coal usage in electricity production in the the United States. This would hurt coal operators as they fight a tough battle against other sources of energy.</p>
      <p><strong>Coal to Benefit From Rising Exports:</strong> Despite an expected drop in the coal production volumes, coal operators in the United States can benefit from the expected rise in coal export volumes. Coal demand is expected to improve due to its economical pricing compared with other energy sources. Higher demand from the Asian market and an expected improvement in steel production should drive U.S. export volumes.</p>
      <p>Coal is still a viable energy option for many crucial industries across the globe. Per EIA, coal export volume may increase by 18.9% in 2023 to 100.8 MMst and by 2.6% more to 103.4 MMst in 2024. The World Steel Association forecasts a rebound in global steel volume production, rising 2.3% in 2023 to touch 1,822.3 Mt and up 1.7% in 2024 to touch 1,854 Mt.</p>
      <p>Steel production requires a lot of high-quality coal and nearly 70% of global steel production depends on coal. With the continued recovery in steel production, coal exports are expected to pick up and improve in the long run.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects</h3>
      <p>The Zacks Coal industry is an 9-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil and Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #246, which places it in the bottom 2% out of 251 Zacks industries.</p>
      <p>The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates lackluster performance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p>
      <p>The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have gone down by 22.2%.</p>
      <p>Before we present a few coal stocks that you may want to keep track of, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.</p>
      <h3>Industry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector</h3>
      <p>The Zacks Coal industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the Zacks Oil and Gas sector over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>The stocks in the coal industry have gained 1.2% compared with the Zacks Oil-Energy sector’s growth of 3.5%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has rallied 14.6% in the same time frame.</p>
      <h3>Coal Industry's Current Valuation</h3>
      <p>Since coal companies have a lot of debt on their balance sheet, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.</p>
      <p>The industry is currently trading at a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.29X compared with the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s 13.3X and the sector’s 2.77X.</p>
      <p>In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 7.6X, as low as 2.01X and at the median of 4.8X.</p>
      <h3>3 Coal Industry Stocks to Keep a Close Watch On</h3>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Ask energy executives how much oil the world will need by 2050 and you will get very different opinions</p>
    	<p>When is it game over for oil? Don’t expect a clear answer from the people with the most to lose from a shift to cleaner fuels.</p>	
    	<p>Within energy circles, estimates of how much oil will be needed in 2050 range anywhere from 80% less than today to business as usual. Investors have the difficult job of betting which companies are on the wrong side of the most important trend for the sector in decades.</p>	
    	<p>At an energy conference this week, Haitham al-Ghais, secretary-general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, repeated the cartel’s view that global demand for oil will hit 110 million barrels a day by 2045—as far out as OPEC currently projects. This is roughly a 10% increase from current rates. Natural gas, renewable power and hydrogen will all play bigger roles, but oil will remain center stage.</p>
      <p>If OPEC is right, it is bad news for efforts to limit climate change. For the world to reach its net-zero target and restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, demand must fall below 30 million barrels a day by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
      <p>Most U.S. majors are also in the “high demand” camp, according to Alexander Schay, managing director at the energy consulting firm WK Associates and co-author of a Securities and Exchange Commission comment that compiled 2050 oil forecasts.</p>
      <p>Exxon Mobil said in a recent filing that the chances of the world getting to net zero are low because of the drop in living standards it would cause. The company expects global oil demand to still be roughly 100 million barrels a day by 2050 and is betting that technologies such as carbon capture and storage, as well as methane abatement, will allow the world to use fossil fuels for decades to come.</p>
      <p>European oil producers are considering the possibility that events move faster. Shell’s latest energy security report looks at two scenarios. Even with no new climate policies, it thinks demand for oil will fall around 10% by the middle of the century. And it sees a plunge if the world gets really serious about reducing emissions.</p>
      <p>BP has looked at two “what if” scenarios in addition to the most aggressive net-zero one. It estimates that oil production will decline by roughly 25% based on trends it is already seeing in the market, or close to 60% in its “accelerated” scenario in which climate regulations get tighter.</p>
      <p>But neither European company is seriously preparing for these challenging outcomes yet. Both Shell and BP recently reversed plans to cut oil production aggressively this decade, indicating that they will reduce supply once demand from customers tails off.</p>
      <p>With demand for oil still growing, higher projections do look more realistic right now. The risk for executives hoping this won’t change is that they are wrong-footed by harsher regulations, wild-card technologies or a surge in destructive weather events that hammers home the need to cut emissions fast.</p>
      <p>All of this underlines the intense uncertainty that energy bosses face, even looking a few years ahead. At Shell’s investor day this month, Chief Executive Wael Sawan told shareholders, “I would be lying to you if I pretended to know where various markets that we’re looking at are going to go in the 2026, 2027, 2028 period.”</p>
      <p>One important swing factor that investors can watch is how fast oil demand for road transportation falls. This will depend on how fuel-efficient gas-engined cars become and how many drivers buy electric vehicles. EVs currently make up 16% of passenger-car sales globally. The data provider EV-volumes.com expects this share to rise rapidly to 68% by 2035.</p>
      <p>Adoption will take longer if electric cars remain unaffordable for many consumers, which depends in part on supplies of battery materials such as lithium. It is also unclear whether creaking electricity infrastructure can cope with the level of electrification needed to wean the world off fossil fuels. Bottlenecks in supply chains and permitting are delaying installments of new wind and solar power capacity, especially in Europe.</p>
      <p>Another trend to watch is whether rising demand for energy in emerging markets can be offset with efficiency measures, such as LED lighting or more efficient air conditioners. And it isn’t just energy: As the middle classes swell, consumers are likely to spend more on packaged goods. That will send demand for oil-based inputs to make virgin plastic soaring, barring better recycling rates or bans on single-use plastic.</p>
      <p>Shareholders don’t look convinced by arguments that oil still has a long road ahead. According to the investment research firm New Constructs, the share prices of Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil and Chevron all imply that the companies’ profits will permanently decline from today’s levels.</p>
      <p>The overall impression is of an oil industry in limbo, waiting to see what happens next.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) -Gold regained some ground on Thursday as traders took advantage of a brief dip below the key psychological $1,900 level that was driven by a volley of robust U.S. economic readings.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold edged up 0.1% at $1,908.4 per ounce by 1:52 p.m. EDT (1752 GMT). U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower at $1,917.90.</p>	
    	<p>Prices fell under $1,900 for the first time since mid-March after the data as the dollar index firmed 0.4%, making bullion less attractive for overseas buyers. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>"We've seen prices move down from $2,000 to $1,900 and that in itself is going to bring about some bargain hunting," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.</p>
      <p>U.S. jobless claims fell last week by the most in 20 months, pointing to labor market strength that also helped prop up gross domestic product in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>"It was a one-two punch taking gold another leg lower ... and then the hawkish central banks haven't helped out at all," said Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said most of the central bank's policymakers expect they would need to raise interest rates at least twice more by year-end with U.S. inflation well above the 2% goal and a labor market that's still very tight.</p>
      <p>While gold is considered an inflation hedge, rising rates dull non-yielding bullion's appeal, with current rate expectations putting it on course to end the quarter in negative territory for the first time since September 2022.</p>
      <p>Traders awaited May's personal consumption expenditure data, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, on Friday.</p>
      <p>Silver fell 0.6% to $22.59 per ounce, while platinum dropped 1.6% to $896.55, an eight-month low.</p>
      <p>Palladium dipped 1.6% to $1,228.50, hovering near its lowest since December 2018.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Political instability in Russia at the weekend marginally impacted commodities at the beginning of the week but China’s economy and the monetary policy path of the US Federal Reserve will be the main focus for investors in the coming days.</p>
    	<p>Yahoo Finance UK takes a look at some of the key macro events moving markets within energy and precious metals, including oil, natural gas, gold and copper.</p>	
      <h3>Oil</h3>
    	<p>Oil opened strongly on Monday, but fell into the red on Tuesday. As a result, Brent crude (BZ=F) settled just 0.45% higher on the day.</p>	
    	<p>“The more hawkish tone from the US Fed appears to be capping oil prices and the broader commodities complex, while there remain broader concerns over China’s economic recovery. Up until now, oil demand indicators for China have been good, with stronger crude oil imports and higher apparent domestic demand,” Warren Paterson and Eva Manthey at ING said.</p>
      <p>“The concern is whether this can continue as there are clearly still some weak spots within the Chinese economy – specifically with industrial production and the property sector,” the analysts also noted in a report.</p>
      <h3>Natural gas</h3>
      <p>Gas markets also reacted to the political uncertainty in Russia with Europe’s Dutch TTF (TTF=F) enduring a volatile trading session to start the week due to concerns over the remaining Russian pipeline supply flows to Europe.</p>
      <p>However, Paterson and Manthey pointed out that fundamentals for the European gas market are still bearish in the short term.</p>
      <p>“EU gas storage continues to fill up and is now more than 76% full, well above the 57% seen at the same stage last year and also higher than the five-year average of 60%. In the absence of any significant supply shocks, EU gas storage will hit the European Commission’s target of 90% full well before 1 November,” the analysts noted.</p>
      <h3>Gold</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the price of gold (GC=F) extended gains again on Tuesday as the turmoil in Russia, gold’s second largest producer, prompted investors to opt for the safe-haven appeal of the precious metal.</p>
      <p>For gold, the current uncertainty in Russia appears to be outweighing risks surrounding interest rates following hawkish comments from the US Federal Reserve. This is important to note because higher rates subsequently discourage investing in non-yielding gold.</p>
      <p>“How long-lasting this boost to the gold price proves will be determined by how widespread the butterfly effect of the aborted rebellion by Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group turns out to be,” Rupert Rowling, market analyst at Kinesis Money, said in a company report.</p>
      <p>“If this proves to be the beginning of the end for president Vladimir Putin’s totalitarian control on Russia, then the resultant uncertainty is likely to keep gold supported in the medium-term with investors wanting to keep some risk off the table.”</p>
      <h3>Copper</h3>
      <p>ING noted on Tuesday that LME copper (HG=F) prices remained under pressure given concerns over Chinese demand and a more hawkish Federal Reserve outlook but said LME copper spreads continue to strengthen, reflecting some tightness in the prompt market.</p>
      <p>“The cash/3m spread rallied by more than $12/t (£9.44/t) on Monday to a backwardation of $31/t – the strongest we have seen this spread since November last year. Available inventories in LME warehouses continue to fall with on-warrant stocks yesterday falling by 4,400 tonnes to just 25,725 tonnes, the lowest since October 2021.”</p>
      <p>A report by Paterson and Manthey highlighted recent data from the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) showing that steel inventories at major Chinese steel mills climbed for a second consecutive week to 16.2mt in mid-June, up 2.64% compared to early June.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile, crude steel production at major mills rose by 1.4% from the above mentioned period to 2.26mt/d in mid-June,” the report said.</p>
      <h3>Data points this week</h3>
      <p>Firstly, the latest US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, the Fed's preferred inflation indicator, will be released on Friday.</p>
      <p>It is expected to show "core" PCE – which strips out the costs of food and energy – rose 4.7% over the prior year in May, unchanged from April. The Fed targets 2% inflation, on average. Over the prior month, "core" PCE is expected to rise 0.4% in May.</p>
      <p>The markets have priced in one more 25bps increase by the Fed before the end of 2023 as it battles to bring down inflation and this latest update may provide further indicators for investors on what the Fed might do next.</p>
      <p>Secondly, PMI data from China will be closely watched on Friday as the world’s second-largest economy continues to struggle as momentum following its reopening from zero- tolerance COVID lockdowns in December has hit demand.</p>
      <p>The incoming PMI data is expected to show the manufacturing sector contracted for the third consecutive month while the services side grew at the slowest pace in six months.</p>
      <p>Osama Rizvi, energy analyst at Primary Vision Network, told Yahoo Finance UK what he is watching this week.</p>
      <p>“The first and most important thing that I’d be looking at is Russia and the Wagner mutiny as it has the potential to turn the oil markets topsy turvy.</p>
      <p>“IFO indices in Germany will be one of the most important statistics to look at in the coming week along with economic data from the US with the most significant being Weekly jobless claims. I’ll also be looking at PMIs coming out of China as it is really important to the story of recession,” he said.</p>

    	<p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Norway announced Wednesday it approved 19 oil and gas projects on the Norwegian continental shelf, saying the total investments are worth over 200 billion kroner ($19 billion).</p>
    	<p>"The projects are also an important contribution to Europe’s energy security,” said Terje Aasland, Norway’s minister for petroleum and energy.</p>	
    	<p>Norway was the only net exporter of oil and gas in Europe, he said, adding, “By carrying out these projects we ensure new production from the latter half of the 2020s, so that we can maintain high Norwegian deliveries.”</p>	
    	<p>The projects consist of new developments, further development of existing fields, and investments in projects for increased extraction at existing fields.</p>
      <p>Norway, one of the world’s wealthiest countries due to its vast oil and gas reserves, said earlier this month that it wants to open parts of its continental shelf for commercial deep-sea mining in line with the country’s strategy to seek new economic opportunities and reduce its reliance on the oil and gas industry.</p>
      <p>The conflict in Ukraine has boosted Norway's revenues as European countries previously reliant on Russia seek alternative energy sources. However, Norway has fended off accusations that it’s profiting from the war in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>In February, the Storting, the Norwegian parliament, announced that the Scandinavian country is donating 75 billion kroner ($7.4 billion) to Kyiv as part of a five-year support package, making Norway one of the world’s biggest donors to war-torn Ukraine. The money was from oil income, and the donation should not affect the Norwegian economy.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices on Wednesday fell to their lowest in nearly 4 months on bets for interest rates remaining higher for longer, while U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated a hawkish stance.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,912.49 per ounce by 1:43 p.m. EDT (1743 GMT), after hitting its lowest since mid-March. U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% lower at $1,922.20.</p>	
    	<p>Powell reiterated that more rate rises likely lie ahead for the central bank, and did not rule out a boost in the cost of borrowing at a policy meeting scheduled for the end of July.</p>
      <p>"Although the market is pricing in a decent chance the Fed is going to hike in July, the more relevant factor for gold is that the market has been simultaneously pricing out the number of cuts we could expect over the next year," said Daniel Ghali, commodity strategist at TD Securities.</p>
      <p>Markets were pricing in a 82% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's next meeting in July, seeing little odds of any easing in monetary policy by the end of this year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>The dollar index firmed 0.4%, making gold less attractive for overseas buyers. A drop in benchmark 10-year Treasury yields limited further downside.</p>
      <p>"Good U.S. economic data remains a headwind for the yellow metal, as it likely keeps Fed officials reiterating a hawkish tone," UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.</p>
      <p>Sales of new U.S. single-family homes surged to the highest in nearly 1-1/2 years in May, while U.S. consumer confidence also jumped in June.</p>
      <p>"We still expect at some point the aggressive monetary policy tightening to weaken U.S. economic data and result in a change of tone by the Fed," Staunovo added.</p>
      <p>High interest rates discourage traders from investing in non-yielding gold.</p>
      <p>Silver fell 0.3% to $22.81 per ounce, platinum shed 1.4% at $912.20 after falling to an eight-month low, and palladium plunged 3.7% to $1,248.06, its lowest in 4-1/2 years.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Gold edged higher as investors assessed increasing geopolitical uncertainty and recessionary signals.</p>
    	<p>Bullion rose as much as 0.6% on Monday after Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin’s extraordinary mutiny. Still, the upside for the haven was limited after Prigozhin suddenly halted his dramatic advance toward Moscow over the weekend.</p>	
    	<p>Bullion is more likely to be influenced by real rates and the dollar, and history suggests that rallies fueled by geopolitical risks tend to be short-lived.</p>	
    	<p>“Gold seems to be trying to price a wide range of possible outcomes all at once, with downside from higher rates and upside from inflation/growth risks,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Amy Sergeant said in an emailed note. “Although gold has been coming off from the highs, it still looks very strong relative to where yields are.”</p>
      <p>Gold prices are still trading under the 100-day moving average, a key support level breached earlier this month as prospects for further monetary tightening by US and European central banks remained at the fore.</p>
      <p>The “sluggish technicals” could see bullion sink to anywhere between $1,875 and $1,880, Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Aakash Doshi said in a note, adding that losses are unlikely to push gold below $1,800.</p>
      <p>Money managers have been turning positive on gold again, increasing net-long positions by 1.4% in the week ending June 20 after bullish bets plunged nearly 20% in the previous session.</p>
      <p>Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,923.62 an ounce as of 10:06 a.m. in New York. Copper was 0.1% higher at $8,397.50 a ton on the London Metal Exchange.</p>

    	<p>The short-lived threat to Vladimir Putin's leadership in Russia has oil markets on the move Monday, but demand concerns have limited early gains.</p>
    	<p>Global oil prices moved higher Monday, lifting U.S. crude back to near $70 per barrel, as markets reacted to weekend developments in Russia and the threat to President Vladimir Putin's leadership that could disrupt supplies over the coming months.</p>	
    	<p>A short-lived insurrection by troops under the command of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a long-time Putin ally, ended late Saturday with the Wagner Group leader brokering a move to neighboring Belarus via President Alexander Lukashenko and Russia agreeing not to prosecute any of the soldiers involved in the weekend convoy that was once heading towards Mocsow.</p>	
    	<p>However, while Putin appears to have maintained his grip on power, questions as to the fate of the nation's army in Ukraine without Wagner support, and the outcome of next month's NATO summit in Vilnius, have added a notable tenor of uncertainty to global markets.</p>
      <p>"While the immediate supply risks have disappeared, the market will likely have to start pricing in a larger risk premium for oil given the growing instability in Russia," said ING's head of commodity strategy Warren Patterson. "How much of a risk premium will really depend on how the aftermath of the failed insurrection is dealt with."</p>
      <p>Oil prices, which initially jumped on fears of supply constraints as traders took advantage of last week's 4% decline to add to long positions, pared some of those gains amid focus on demand weakness from China and the ongoing implications from central bank rate hikes around the world.</p>
      <p>Russia' rouble, meanwhile, fell 3% against the U.S. dollar on Monday, the biggest single-day decline of the year, before rebounding to around 84.59 in late-morning trading in Europe</p>
      <p>Brent contracts for August delivery, the global pricing benchmark, added 43 cents to trade at $74.28 per barrel while WTI future for the same month, which are tightly-linked to U.S. gasoline prices, rose 34 cents to $69.50 per barrel.</p>
      <p>U.S. drillers pared the number of active rigs by another 6 units last week, according to late Friday data from oil services group Baker Hughes, taking the overall total to 546, the lowest since April of last year, amid softening demand from China and elsewhere that underscores OPEC's move to extended their collective production cuts until at least the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, the cartel's most influential member, said earlier this month that it will its output by another 1 million barrels per day, starting in July, the Kingdom said following OPEC's weekend meeting in Vienna. Other OPEC members will keep their current cuts of 3.66 million barrels per day, equivalent to around 3.6% of global demand, in place until early 2024.</p>
      <p>The group will also lower its overall production targets from January 2024 by another 1.4 million barrels per day, lead by efforts from Russia, Nigeria and Angola.</p>
      <p>While a deterioration in Russia may raise concerns about stability and supply, the short-term outlook continues to focus on the risk of lower-than-expected demand in China, hawkish surprises with larger-than-expected rate hikes from some central banks, and the stronger dollar," Saxo Bank strategists wrote. "But with Russia likely to remain a key focus this week, the downside risks should be limited."</p>

    	<p>Oil markets have been buzzing over a potential return of Iranian oil to the market amid press reports of renewed U.S.-Iranian talks.</p>
    	<p>For the OPEC+ group that’s already cutting crude oil production to support prices, Iran’s potential return is just one challenge among many.</p>	
    	<p>Since 2016, OPEC has been cooperating with 10 non-OPEC countries, including Russia, to manage production. Or at least, most OPEC members have been cooperating: Iran, Libya, Venezuela have been exempt from production targets in recent years.</p>	
    	<p>In Iran’s case the exemption dates to 2019 following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, which caused production and exports to decline sharply. (Libyan and Venezuelan production has also declined in recent years.)</p>
      <p>Iranian production has been recovering gradually for a while now. The U.S. withdrew from the nuclear-weapons deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that had been relaxed under the agreement.</p>
      <p>Iranian production fell by roughly two million barrels a day and hit bottom in mid-2020. Since then, output has increased by about one million barrels a day, with Iran claiming to have produced just over three million barrels a day of crude oil in May.</p>
      <p>Even with U.S. sanctions in place, Iran has worked with countries including China to evade U.S. sanctions (using techniques now employed by Russia to evade Group of Seven sanctions) and sometimes amid allegations that the U.S. was turning a blind eye amid concerns about spiking oil prices.</p>
      <p>If Iranian production and export facilities have been maintained over the past five years—a significant question mark—the historical data suggests Iran could raise output by as much as an additional one million barrels a day if sanctions were lifted, or if enforcement faltered.</p>
      <p>(One thought-provoking wrinkle: A substantial recovery of Iranian supply could create pressure for the OPEC+ to once again assign a production target to Iran—a tension that makes the recent, Chinese-brokered restoration of Iranian diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia even more interesting.)</p>
      <p>At the same time that Iranian supply is rising, other positive surprises have further bolstered world oil supplies.</p>
      <p>Most important, Russian supply has remained robust, despite the imposition of a European Union embargo and a G7 price cap on both Russian crude oil and refined products.</p>
      <p>In January, the International Energy Agency expected Russian production to fall by over 1.3 million barrels a day this year after the imposition of sanctions; it now expects a decline of just 0.3 million barrels a day, though Russian follow-through on its promises to cut production in response to Western sanctions remains uncertain.</p>
      <p>And that’s not all. Even with U.S. shale producers under pressure to limit their investment after a decade of poor returns, the U.S. Energy Department has increased its forecast for domestic supply. The department now expects U.S. production to grow by over one million barrels a day this year, finally returning to prepandemic levels.</p>
      <p>With additional growth from other sources including Brazil, Mexico, and Guyana (as well as global biofuels), the IEA now expects production outside of OPEC to rise by roughly 1.7 million barrels a day this year.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Iran and Russia aren’t the only sanctions-impacted countries where supply is surprising to the upside. Venezuelan output has begun to recover after the U.S. eased some sanctions, rising by nearly 0.5 million barrels a day since bottoming out in mid-2020 to now stand near 0.9 million barrels a day.</p>
      <p>State-owned PDVSA hopes to increase production beyond one million barrels a day later this year, but the poor state of the industry after many years of neglect and sanctions probably limits the near-term upside.</p>
      <p>With all this new supply, it’s not surprising that the OPEC+ group has returned to cutting production in an effort to support prices. Indeed, Saudi Arabia is so concerned about risks to the market that it recently pledged an additional cut of one million barrels a day for July—with the potential to extend the cut beyond July if necessary.</p>
      <p>The saving grace may be strong demand growth—maybe. Many forecasters expect robust demand growth this year, driven by China’s reopening after last year’s zero-Covid shut-downs. The IEA and OPEC both expect global demand to rise by about 2.4 million barrels a day this year.</p>
      <p>With robust demand growth, the IEA says that the latest OPEC+ production cuts could push the oil market into a large deficit over the second half of the year, resulting in large inventory withdrawals—and, by extension, the risk of significantly higher prices.</p>
      <p>But that’s where the “maybe” comes in. The recovery of Chinese demand has been slower and weaker than expected, with the national company CNPC recently lowering its Chinese oil demand forecast.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, many analysts believe that the risks of a recession in the U.S. and elsewhere are significant—with related downside risks for oil demand.</p>
      <p>So maybe OPEC+ is overreacting to supply threats including Iran, and maybe it isn’t. Certainly from a producer’s perspective, the group’s caution—and Saudi Arabia’s proactive voluntary cuts—would seem appropriate.</p>
      <p>And if they’re wrong—well, what producer ever complained about high prices?</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices hovered near a three-month low on Friday and were set for their biggest weekly drop since February, as the dollar strengthened after U.S. Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell hinted more interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Spot gold was flat at $1,914.09 per ounce by 0644 GMT and stayed close to a three-month low hit earlier in the session. Prices are down 2.3% for the week.</p>

      <p>"Gold has extended lower out of the range that it was occupying for a few weeks, suggesting there is more weakness ahead. The decline matches up with the rise in yields, reflecting hawkish comments from Powell and Fed officials more generally," said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.</p>
      <p>Powell, in his second day of testimony, said the U.S. central bank would move interest rates at a "careful pace" from here as policymakers edge towards a stopping point for their historic round of monetary policy tightening.</p>
      <p>While gold is struggling to find any impetus amid the higher interest rate outlook, it has shown an ability to stage a recovery after recent price dips, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.</p>
      <p>Asian stocks, meanwhile, slumped toward their worst week of the year as a string of hawkish central bank surprises made investors nervous about the economic cost of taming inflation.</p>
      <p>Spot silver edged 0.2% higher to $22.2775 per ounce, but was set for its biggest weekly drop since October 2022. Platinum fell 0.2% to $921.55.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) -Oil prices fell for a second straight session and were headed for a weekly decline of more than 3% on Friday, as a higher-than-expected interest rate hike in Britain and warnings about looming rate rises in the U.S. ignited concerns over demand.</p>	
    	<p>Brent futures slipped 51 cents, or 0.4%, to $73.76 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 42 cents, or 0.6%, at $69.09 at 0240 GMT.</p>	
    	<p>"Recession fears mount again following central banks' rate hikes and a hawkish Fed," said Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets, adding that a stronger dollar was also weighing on prices.</p>
      <p>An increase in the value of the dollar, which has risen 0.3% this week, can weigh on oil demand by making the fuel more expensive for holders of other currencies.</p>
      <p>Both crude benchmarks had dropped about $3 in the previous session after the Bank of England raised interest rates by half a percentage point, sparking fears of an economic slowdown denting fuel demand.</p>
      <p>The market is now waiting for the release of Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) from around the world on Friday for a view on manufacturing activity and demand trends.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., crude stocks posted a surprise drawdown in the last week, helped by strong export demand and low imports, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. However, gasoline and distillate inventories rose. [EIA/S]</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would move interest rates at a "careful pace" from here as policymakers edge towards ending their historic round of monetary policy tightening.</p>
      <p>Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand. Fears of hikes by major central banks have clouded the fuel demand outlook for the rest of the year.</p>

    	<p>If you're watching for signs of a looming recession, pay attention to commodity prices.</p>
    	<p>Copper (HG=F) futures are down about 8% in the last six months despite a recent rebound. The price of the metal, used for everything from wiring to construction, is 17% lower from March 2022 levels.</p>	
    	<p>"Copper is this profoundly important raw material for all of these electrical vehicles and how we're going to transform energy and remove carbon," Hugh Hendry, investor and former global fund manager told Yahoo Finance.</p>	
    	<p>"The price is falling and falling. It's very weak. These are very large, very global, very liquid markets. And, and they're suggesting caution," he added.</p>
      <p>China's lackluster recovery following its strict Covid lockdowns in 2022 has put pressure on crude, despite the world's largest exporters announcing output cuts in hopes of keeping a floor on prices.</p>
      <p>The recent banking turmoil in March intensified a market sell-off in commodities amid fears of a recession due to a credit reduction.</p>
      <p>Hendry says the bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse point to an ominous sign for the economy.</p>
      <p>"You typically get bankruptcies when credit costs escalate and it reveals the folly that is yet to happen," he said.</p>
      <p>"A recession is brewing onshore in the US. It's certainly there in Europe, it's there in in Germany," added Hendry.</p>
      <p>Some sectors of the economy, like commercial real estate are contracting. Others, like travel and leisure, are still going strong.</p>
      <p>Some strategists are waiting for more signs to determine when the US will enter a recession. Many Wall Street economists have dialed back expectations that one will occur this year.</p>
      <p>"We do not believe that we will enter a recession in the US in the short run as the US housing sector is resilient due to a shortage of homes for sale. Every prior recession has been precipitated by a major decline in the housing sector," Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Management told Yahoo Finance.</p>
      <p>Hatfield forecasts "oil is likely to rally in the second half of 2023 as US growth remains solid and the China economy recovers as the government provides monetary stimulus."</p>
      <p>West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ-F) futures are down about 8% since the beginning of January. Both are roughly 20% lower compared to last year.</p>

        <li>Retail demand for physical gold has slowed in China, Bloomberg reports.</li>
        <li>Sales fell from an April peak of 44% year-over-year, to 24% in May.</li>

      </ul>
    	<p>China's gold demand is starting to ease as the country's economic sluggishness ripples into the sector, Bloomberg reported.</p>
    	<p>Where sales of gold and silver jewelry rose rapidly in early 2023, they expanded only 24% year-on-year in May, the first sign of a slowdown this year.</p>	
    	<p>Alongside India, the nation leads as the largest consumer of physical gold bars, jewelry and coins, the outlet said. After the country lifted pandemic restrictions at the end of last year, pent-up demand led to a surge in the sales, climbing 37% and 44% in March and April.</p>
      <p>May's cooldown runs alongside similar trends throughout China, as its economic growth has been fizzling out after a strong first-quarter performance. That month saw industrial output, retail and investment decelerate sharply from April, while unemployment among those age 16 to 24 reached record highs.</p>
      <p>Beijing has responded to slowing economic activity with plans for direct stimulus, while the country's central bank introduced the first interest rate cuts since August, as a way to encourage spending.</p>
      <p>Still, demand for the commodity is expected to weaken further in June. The Shanghai gold price now trades at a discount to the international rate, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the World Gold Council.</p>	
    	<p>While earlier Chinese demand for the yellow metal helped support a record high of over $2,000 an ounce, gold still stands at around $1,935. Despite slowing retail sales, the safe-haven asset is likely to maintain an elevated level thanks to geopolitical tensions and recessionary fears.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, foreign central banks are also likely to support the higher price, as they have been stockpiling the reserve asset at significantly high levels over the past few quarters. This follows as countries are looking to ease their dollar dependence, having seen the effect of dollar sanctions on Russia.</p>
      <p>China is no exception. Its central bank holds 2,092 tons of gold, having amassed 160 tons in the past seven months.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- The jitters affecting the world’s second-biggest economy are starting to feed through into China’s gold market.</p>
    	<p>A surge in purchases by Chinese residents, driven by pent-up demand after three years of pandemic restrictions and optimism that the economy would quickly rebound, is starting to slow — yet another sign that the recovery is losing momentum.</p>	
    	<p>China vies with India as the world’s biggest consumer of gold bars, coins and jewelry. Its central bank has also been a recent buyer, adding to its reserves for seven straight months after a three-year pause.</p>	
    	<p>Although most gold trades as a financial asset — notably as a haven for investors during risky times or as a hedge against inflation — China’s physical demand for the precious metal has helped underpin its ascent this year to over $2,000 an ounce.</p>
      <p>The rapid expansion in retail sales of gold and silver jewelry looks to have topped out, rising 24% year-on-year in May to 26.6 billion yuan ($3.7 billion). That’s slower than the 44% and 37% growth recorded in the previous two months. The same period last year included the extended lockdown of Shanghai, when demand for goods and services cratered across the economy.</p>
      <p>A key demand indicator for the precious metal suggests a further weakening in June. From a premium of $44.20 an ounce in March, the Shanghai gold price is now trading at a discount to the international market, according to the World Gold Council.</p>
      <p>“Residents are pretty cautious in spending cash right now amid various uncertainties,” said Jiang Shu, general manager of the precious metals department at Shanghai Shandong Gold Industrial Development Co. “We may not see a rapid surge in purchases again without a slump in gold prices.”</p>
      <p>The issues that have kept international prices close to record levels are still in play: the war in Ukraine, tensions between Washington and Beijing, and inflation and recession fears across the globe. At the same time, domestic factors such as weak markets for other investments like stocks and property could help support demand.</p>
      <p>Although China’s buying spree has slowed, retail sales should stay elevated in the near term as gold remains a sound investment while inflation concerns persist, particularly in the US, said Zhang Ting, an analyst with Sichuan Tianfu Bank Co. Further purchases from the People’s Bank of China could also offset declines in retail sales, said Shanghai Shandong’s Jiang.</p>

    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Tuesday after China cut benchmark lending rates in a potential boost to growth but oil demand was seen rising less than expected this year, in a mixed picture for consumption by the world's largest crude importer.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude was up 69 cents, or 0.9%, at $76.78 a barrel at 1226 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for July was down 3 cents from Friday's close at $71.75. The July contract expires at the end of trade on Tuesday.</p>	
    	<p>The more active WTI crude contract for August delivery was up 10 cents from Friday at $72.03 per barrel. There was no settlement in the WTI contract on Monday due to a public holiday in the United States.</p>
      <p>China on Tuesday cut two benchmark lending rates by 10 basis points each. The cuts, the first in 10 months, were less aggressive than some forecasts.</p>
      <p>"Oil traders may need to see a materialised strong economic rebound in China to improve their outlook on oil demand," said Tina Teng, a markets analyst at CMC Markets in Auckland.</p>
      <p>The rate reductions follow recent economic data that showed China's retail and factory sectors are struggling to sustain the momentum seen earlier this year.</p>
      <p>While China's 2023 crude oil demand is expected to rise 3.5% on last year, a researcher at China National Petroleum Corporation's (CNPC) research arm said on Tuesday, down around 1% from a previous estimate in March.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile China's fuel oil imports eased slightly in May after hitting a decade-high in April.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government met last week to discuss measures to spur growth in the economy, and several major banks have cut their 2023 economic growth forecasts for China amid concerns its post-COVID recovery is faltering.</p>
      <p>Higher interest rates reduce appetite for spending and can drive down oil demand.</p>
      <p>On the supply side, Iran's crude exports and oil output have hit new highs in 2023 despite U.S. sanctions.</p>
      <p>Russia is also set to increase seaborne diesel and gasoil exports this month, outweighing cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Moscow itself.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Wind and solar power are sometimes dinged for not producing electricity 24 hours a day, but one of the most abundant minerals on the planet, iron, could be key to changing that.</p>
    	<p>Form Energy, founded in 2017, recently broke ground in West Virginia on its first commercial-scale factory to make iron-air batteries — totally different from lithium ion. The company's goal is to one day help supply the electrical grid across the United States with renewable energy 24 hours a day and slash the need for burning coal and natural gas, polluting energy sources we currently rely on</p>	
    	<p>CEO Mateo Jaramillo spoke with The Associated Press about progress toward achieving this vision. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p>	
    	<p>Q: Why do you consider batteries a climate solution?</p>
      <p>A: When I left divinity school in 2004 I made a sector bet and figured at some point, society will want effective energy storage. I grew up in Salinas, California, which is an agricultural town, and my parents worked for the farmer community. I’ve seen how many enjoy the benefits of traditional energy, but only some communities carry the burdens. I was compelled to figure a way to make a difference and felt that innovation was needed.</p>
      <p>Q: Lithium ion batteries have some limitations and can only pump out power for four hours max. Why are iron-air batteries a good choice?</p>
      <p>A: Lithium ion is an established, accepted technology being deployed at great volumes. But there isn’t a clear alternative on the market yet. We’re doing something different, storing energy for 100 hours at dramatically lower costs, to solve a multi-day storage problem as opposed to single-digit hours. Multi-day storage does not crowd out something like lithium ion, they complement each other very nicely. We see this over and over and over again in the modeling we do: Our lowest cost, most reliable, most decarbonized system has multiple types of energy storage.</p>
      <p>Q: How much iron will you need?</p>
      <p>A: About 2 billion tons of iron are mined globally every year — we would be in the single digital percentage of that total. Iron is available pretty much wherever you want to find it, there are massive deposits on every continent.</p>
      <p>Q: Why did you choose West Virginia for the battery manufacturing facility?</p>
      <p>A: The Mississippi River and Ohio River are essential for moving several million tons of material in a cost effective way. There are rail lines and a highway system nearby, so from a logistics perspective, it is a compelling site. Many people in the area also had great experience working in industrial environments given the community's history of producing steel, iron, and mining.</p>
      <p>Q: How did you build trust with the local community?</p>
      <p>A: Being transparent and committed to the region. We held a meeting at the local community center and a few hundred people came by. We had team members there just to say hello, answer questions, and to start to talk. There is excitement about the new jobs and work that is happening very actively. Early next year we will start to turn on the factory, so this is not a long wait and see process, this is moving immediately.</p>
      <p>Q: Are batteries necessary for the U.S. to achieve net zero emissions?</p>
      <p>A: The right kinds of energy are a core part of net zero, but there is no panacea or silver bullet. A lot of work over the next 20-30 years is needed across all industries that touch the power sector. It's not just technology, much less one company, showing up and saying, “We’ve got the whole thing fixed.” It’s going to take everybody.</p>
      <p>Q: Have you had any moments of doubt since Form Energy was founded in 2017?</p>
      <p>A: Whenever you embark on a deep technical challenge, you never know if the universe works the way you hope it does. There were moments of uncertainty, but very few, if any, moments of doubt. I was sure we had characterized the problem correctly, and that there was a big market need, and the solution would show up at the right time. It’s been a fairly linear pathway, which speaks volumes to the capabilities of our technical team.</p>
      <p>Q: What does Form Energy need to accomplish for you to feel that the company’s mission has been achieved?</p>
      <p>A: We won’t begin talking about our achievements until we are delivering to customers successfully because that’s what distinguishes a venture from a business. Right now we are a well-funded venture and have raised more than $800 million in venture capital funding. A business requires producing and selling to customers for value, so we won’t do that until close to the end of 2024. That’s when we can say, what else? Where do we go from here?</p>
      <p>But to me, that’s the very beginning of what we hope to accomplish. The goal is to have a big impact for a very, very long time by building a category-defining company that positively impacts the economy and people who rely on electricity.</p>
      <p>Q: What would you say to someone that is anxious about climate change?</p>
      <p>A: I am a techno optimist, but there are a lot of good approaches in policy and business pointing to the solutions we need. Everybody has a role to play and all voices have to be part of technology, policy, and individual actions.</p>

    	<p>By Kate Abnett</p>
    	<p>LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -European Union countries failed on Monday to agree on planned new rules for the bloc's power market, having clashed over a proposal to extend subsidies for coal plants under the reform, and a push to expand state aid for other power plants.</p>	
    	<p>EU energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg ended talks without a joint stance on the reforms that seek to avoid a repeat of last year's energy crisis, when record-high gas prices left consumers with soaring energy bills.</p>
      <p>The talks had been complicated by a late proposal by Sweden, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, to allow countries to prolong capacity mechanism subsidies for coal power plants that pay generators to keep capacity on standby to avoid blackouts.</p>
      <p>EU countries' ambassadors will take up the negotiations, aiming for a deal this month.</p>
      <p>Asked about the coal proposal, Swedish Energy Minister Ebba Busch said ensuring Poland, which borders Ukraine, had stable power generation could help it support Ukraine with back-up power.</p>
      <p>Poland, which gets around 70% of its power from coal, could prolong its support scheme for coal plants, potentially until 2028, under the proposal.</p>
      <p>Countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg had objected, saying the move would undermine Europe's goals to fight climate change.</p>
      <p>The draft proposal, seen by Reuters, would allow existing capacity mechanisms to temporarily waive a CO2 emissions limit - enabling coal plants to participate - if they fail to attract enough lower-carbon generators, and if the European Commission approved the exemption.</p>
    	<p>"For some of us, security means capacity markets," Polish Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said earlier on Monday.</p>
      <p>Coal is the most CO2-emitting fossil fuel. Scientists say its use must plummet this decade if the world is to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change.</p>
      <h3>STATE AID</h3>
      <p>Ministers also struggled to agree rules governing state support for renewable and nuclear power plants, with Germany and France at odds over the issue.</p>
      <p>Germany, Austria and the Netherlands had said letting countries offer fixed-price power contracts with the state to existing power plants, as well as new ones, could distort the EU's single market.</p>
      <p>"This could lead to market distortions as large parts of the markets could become inflexible, and also to a distortion of a level playing field concerning the prices in Europe," German Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck said in the meeting.</p>
      <p>EU diplomats said the concerns centred around the potential use of these subsidies for French nuclear plants.</p>
      <p>French Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher opposed the call to restrict the use of such contracts, which she said "endangers the objective of security of supply and of protecting consumers".</p>
      <p>The proposed EU power market reform aims to make power prices more stable. Once they agree a common position, countries must negotiate the final law with the EU Parliament.</p>
      <p>The latest proposal would also let countries introduce national schemes, until mid-2024, to recoup windfall revenues from some power plants if power prices spike - a move backed by countries including Greece and Spain.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- A total of 19 trains carrying coal to Australia’s flagship export hub for the fuel were disrupted after a protester suspended themselves from two poles over rail tracks.</p>
    	<p>Part of a rail line in Kooragang, close to the Port of Newcastle in New South Wales state, was halted for more than four hours from 7 a.m. local time Monday, according to the Australian Rail Track Corp., which manages the network.</p>	
    	<p>A 22-year-old woman was arrested at the scene after law enforcement removed the structure from the tracks, New South Wales police said in a statement.</p>	
    	<p>Australia’s status as the world’s No. 2 coal exporter has long been a focus for activists who argue the nation’s sales of the fossil fuel are a key contributor to global emissions.</p>
      <p>While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has legislated more ambitious national climate targets, his government has also shown support for a coal sector forecast to generate about A$128 billion ($88 billion) in export earnings this fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Blockade Australia’s demonstration at Kooragang was “a response to Australia’s destruction of the climate,” the campaign group said in a message posted to Twitter. Two separate protests also took place Monday near the Port of Melbourne and Port of Brisbane, the organization said.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group, which handles coal exports for producers including BHP Group Ltd., Yancoal Australia Ltd. and Whitehaven Coal Ltd., didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>BHP declined as much as 1.1% in Sydney by 1:08 p.m., as Whitehaven fell as much as 3.9% and Yancoal by as much as 2.8%.</p>

    	<p>iShares Gold Trust Micro offers the lowest fees, Invesco DB Precious Metals Fund has the best return, and SPDR Gold Trust is the most liquid.</p>
    	<p>For investors looking to hedge their bets on the unpredictable economy, gold exchange-traded funds can be a more manageable and cheaper way to invest in the commodity.</p>	
    	<p>Gold prices are currently hovering around an all-time high and certain ETFs may be able to help investors capitalize on the hot market.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>	
      <ul>
        <li>Gold prices are hovering around all-time highs.</li>
        <li>iShares Gold Micro ETF has the lowest expense ratio. Invesco DB Precious Metals Fund has the best 1-year performance. And SPDR Gold Trust offers traders the best liquidity.</li>
        <li>The holdings of these ETFs are represented by gold bullion and precious metals futures.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Some 10 gold-focused ETFs trade in the U.S., excluding leveraged and inverse funds as well as those with less than $50 million in assets under management (AUM).They invest directly in either gold bullion or gold futures contracts as opposed to companies that mine for the metal.</p>
      <p>Below, we look at three gold ETFs with the lowest fees, the best 12-month return, and the most liquidity. We have excluded leveraged ETFs, which provide outsized returns but come with extra risk. All data below are as of June 14.</p>
      <p><strong>Gold ETF with the Lowest Fess: iShares Gold Trust Micro ETF (IAUM)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance Over One Year: 7.51%</li>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Europe’s natural gas prices have shot up by more than half so far in June following months of declines, in a troubling reminder of last year’s energy crisis.</p>
    	<p>Benchmark gas futures prices have risen 52% since the start of this month to hit €35 ($38) per megawatt hour, according to data from the Independent Commodity Intelligence Service (ICIS).</p>	
    	<p>Prices reversed course mainly because of longer-than-expected maintenance outages at key gas plants in Norway, analysts told CNN.</p>	
    	<p>“The recent price rally shows just how sensitive the European market is to disruption,” said Bill Weatherburn, a commodities economist at Capital Economics.</p>
      <p>European natural gas prices are still far below their levels last summer, when the continent found itself locked in an energy standoff with Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. But the rapid run-up in prices this month shows just how vulnerable the region remains to any supply disruption following the slump in imports from Russia.</p>
      <p>Norway’s gas network operator, Gassco, said on its website Tuesday that a planned shutdown at one of its gas processing plants had been extended until July 15. It had been due to come back online on June 21. Two other gas plants will remain offline indefinitely, due to “process problems.”</p>
      <p>Last year, Norway replaced Russia as the biggest source of natural gas imports in the European Union, with more than 24% of the market, while Moscow piped 15%.</p>
      <p>Europe could be about to lose another source of gas. Prices spiked Thursday following reports that the Netherlands plans to permanently shut its Groningen gas field in October, rather than a year later, which had been an option.</p>
      <p>Gas futures reached an intra-day high of almost €50 ($55) per megawatt hour before falling back. That was more than double their level at the start of the month.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Dutch government told CNN Friday that it hadn’t yet made a decision about when to close Groningnen.</p>
      <p>Once a major supplier of natural gas for Europe, the Netherlands has been winding down production at the onshore field over the past decade because of the risk of earthquakes. The field is one of the biggest in the world but now accounts for just a fraction of Europe’s gas supply. Still, reports that it might close in October appear to have rattled traders.</p>
      <p>“The European gas market — and by extension the global gas market — [is] certainly not out of the woods in terms of adequately matching supply with demand,” Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at ICIS, told CNN.</p>
      <p>He added that an uptick in prices “was always expected” given that futures prices for natural gas deliveries for the next two winters had remained elevated compared with historical norms.</p>
      <h3>Stronger position</h3>
      <p>Prices soared to an all-time high of €340 ($372) per megawatt hour in late August as European countries raced to fill their stores ahead of the winter months.</p>
      <p>Those storage facilities are now 73% full — a much higher level than the 56% the bloc averaged at the same time of the year over the past five years, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe.</p>
      <p>“The panic period that we saw last summer… [is] very unlikely to happen again,” Massimo Di Odoardo, a senior gas researcher at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told CNN.</p>
      <p>Record levels of stored gas in Japan and South Korea, combined with a weaker-than-expected recovery in the Chinese economy, also reduce the chance of Europe being forced into another expensive scramble with Asia for imports of liquefied natural gas this year, he said.</p>
      <p>Still, it hasn’t taken much to shake traders’ confidence.</p>
      <p>“Europe still has to cope with the fact that there’s [little] Russian gas in Europe,” Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN. “Unplanned disruptions can still lead to price spikes.”</p>
      <p>According to Di Odoardo, the extended shutdown of key gas plants in Norway “could easily shave off another [billion cubic meters] of supply over the next few months.”</p>
      <p>“It only really takes 5 bcm less… to make the market a lot tighter.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- AGL Energy Ltd. said it would massively expand its production of clean energy as it abandons coal-fired power plants.</p>
    	<p>The company will spend as much as A$10 billion ($6.9 billion) of its own money to build new facilities, including with debt-financing, Chief Financial Officer Gary Brown said at an investor day in Melbourne on Friday.</p>	
    	<p>The Australian coal giant, which came under attack from billionaire climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes last year, plans to shut all its coal plants by 2035 and replace them with 12 gigawatts of additional renewable capacity and storage.</p>
      <p>That new energy — the equivalent of five large coal plants — will include wind and solar farms, grid-scale batteries and other storage infrastructure, and could also include some back-up gas plants.</p>
      <p>“Coal is leaving the market. That means we have to replace those assets,” said AGL CEO Damien Nicks. “The system is tight,” he said, “but I do not believe the lights will go out.”</p>
      <p>Shares jumped 11% to A$10.74 as of 3:08 p.m. in Sydney as the company also raised its underlying profit guidance for the full year.</p>
    	<p>The A$10 billion will fund about half of the planned 12 gigawatts. The rest — which the company did not put a dollar figure on — will come from third parties, including joint ventures with “renowned renewable asset developers” and power purchase agreements, Brown said.</p>
      <p>Australia is undergoing one of the world’s most rapid shifts from coal to renewables. The nation currently relies on the fuel for well over 50% of its electricity, but could be almost entirely powered by wind, solar and zero carbon storage by the end of next decade, according to official estimates.</p>
      <p>There are fears investment is not happening fast enough to replace aging coal plants, which have struggled to compete with cheap wind and solar but continue to supply vital baseload power particularly at times of peak demand when the sun isn’t shining.</p>
      <p>AGL’s shift to renewables is a turnaround for the company, which until last year had intended to keep its coal plants running until well into the 2040s. Coal and gas make up the biggest chunk of AGL’s earnings, but Brown said he was confident the new low carbon business would fill the earnings gap by 2035.</p>
      <p>AGL made global headlines last year when it became the target of a takeover by Canadian private equity giant Brookfield Asset Management and Cannon-Brookes, who wanted to shut its coal plants early and replace them with renewables. That bid failed, but Cannon-Brookes, founder of software company Atlassian Corp., subsequently built an 11% stake in the company and drove a board and executive shake-up that led to a more ambitious emissions-reduction strategy.</p>
      <p>Cannon-Brookes’s family office Grok Ventures did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. But the plan can be seen as a success for the Sydney-based billionaire, whose key objectives of coal closures and renewable investments are now company policy.</p>

    	<p>Peak Oil will be very kind to Shell. The British oil and gas giant announced on Wednesday that it's going to keep oil production steady this...</p>
    	<p>The British oil and gas giant announced on Wednesday that it’s going to keep oil production steady this decade after all. That marks a gear-change from two years ago, when the company said it would cut oil production by 1-2% every year until 2030 — although Shell did some incredible logical acrobatics to argue otherwise. This comes just as the International Energy Agency announced a prediction that peak oil demand is now in sight.</p>	
    	<h3>Get It While It’s Hot</h3>
      <p>Shell’s 2021 promise to reduce oil production was made by former CEO Ben van Beurden, who also promised to get Shell to net zero by 2050. Van Beurden was replaced in January by Wael Sawan, who placed investor rewards front and foremost on Wednesday.</p>	
    	<p>Sawan promised to cut back on spending, boost the company’s dividend, and launch share buybacks later this year, saying: “We will invest in the models that work—those with the highest returns that play to our strengths.”</p>
      <p>There may be a little bit of time pressure playing into Sawan’s decision as well. In a report published on Wednesday, the IEA said it expects global oil demand to peak in 2028:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The IEA expects demand for oil as a transport fuel to peak even earlier, in 2026. “The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.</li>
        <li>Right now, however, companies are all in on gas and oil according to the IEA, with global investment into exploration, extraction, and production on track to hit its highest level since 2015.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Oil producers need to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly transition,” Birol said. In other words, that peak has a sharp ledge.</p>
      <p><strong>Drilling Your Cake and Eating It:</strong> While Sawan aggressively courts Wall Street, Shell maintains it’s staying true to its climate pledges. Shell claimed that it has in fact already fulfilled its 2021 oil production reduction promise, because seven months after making that promise it sold off a $9.5 billion stake in a Texas oil project. “Our target of a reduction in oil production by 2030 has not changed. We’ve just met it eight years early,” a spokesperson said. If they sell the whole company, does that count as achieving net zero?</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Some types of inflation are highly visible. Gasoline prices, in giant numbers at every filling station, are probably the most-seen inflation gauge.</p>
    	<p>Other types of inflation are hidden, such as the indecipherable charges for electricity detailed in most people’s utility bills. Household energy has been a significant driver of inflation during the last two years, but there’s now a good chance power prices will drop for the foreseeable future. “Summer 2023 looks less painful for consumers and businesses,” Citi Research energy analysts wrote in a June 14 report.</p>	
    	<p>Most types of energy surged in price starting in 2021, with oil and gasoline prices peaking last June, when gas hit $5 per gallon. Pump prices are now down to about $3.60, close enough to the trendline of the last 10 years to call normal.</p>	
    	<p>Prices have fallen for a few reasons: Russia’s war in Ukraine hasn’t produced the oil shock some people expected. Supply has picked up. More refining capacity has come online. And demand from China, a huge energy customer, has been weak amid a sputtering economy there.</p>
      <p>Nearly every driver knows the price of gasoline. Hardly anybody knows the price of natural gas. Yet many Americans spend more on natural gas than on gasoline, via their electricity, heat, and hot-water bills. Natural gas powers 40% of electricity in the United States and provides 50% of winter heat, the biggest source of both. And eye-popping utility bills during the last two years have largely been due to elevated natural gas prices.</p>
      <p>The hydro-fracturing or “fracking” revolution in the United States generated record levels of domestic oil and natural gas production, starting around 2012. Since gas is harder to ship than oil, regions with abundant gas tend to enjoy sharply lower prices than regions that have to import it. During the five years before the COVID pandemic erupted in 2020, US natural gas prices averaged around $2.75 per 1 million BTU, the standard pricing measure. That was at the low range of pricing data going back to 1998.</p>
      <p>In 2021, as the economy began to recover from the COVID downturn and demand for energy picked up, US natural gas prices averaged $3.90. In 2022, with global energy markets heavily stressed, they averaged, $6.40, more than double pre-COVID levels.</p>
      <p>Unlike gasoline, utility bills are regulated in many areas, and providers can’t always pass on the full amount of higher costs to consumers. But average household spending on electricity jumped from $115 to $134 per month, on average, from 2020 to 2022, or about $250 more per year.</p>
      <p>A family spending $100 per month on gas for heat and hot water in 2020 would have been paying about $135 two years later, or an extra $420 per year. Higher natural gas and electricity prices contributed to the rising cost of many other things as well, given that manufacturers, shippers, and retailers were all paying higher energy costs, as well, and passing whatever they could get away with on to consumers.</p>
      <p>The fever is now breaking. High natural gas prices and the need for new sources of gas in Europe, which has stopped most Russian supplies, have pushed US natural gas production to new record highs. A glut now seems to be forming, with prices falling.</p>
      <p>Citi analysts predict natural gas prices could fall to the range of $1 per million BTU later this year, and maybe even lower. The lowest monthly average for gas prices was $1.63 in June 2020, right after the COVID outbreak. So if Citi’s right, gas prices are headed toward new record lows.</p>
      <p>Household energy costs, including electricity, are finally in retreat. The Consumer Price Index for household energy jumped 37% from the low in 2020 to the peak in January of this year. Household energy costs have fallen 7% since then. Electricity is following a similar trend, with costs up 27% from 2020 to the beginning of 2023. Electricity prices are down just 2% since then, but should fall further as basic energy prices decline.</p>
      <p>Other types of energy are getting cheaper as well, including coal, diesel fuel (which is similar to heating oil), propane, and renewables. All fossil fuels shot up in 2022, for similar reasons, as Russia’s war in Ukraine and a recovering global economy scrambled markets. Prices are falling now for similar reasons: strong supply and tepid demand. So most consumers are likely to benefit, however they heat and power their homes. Cool.</p>

	    <p>GAIL agreed to a 20-year deal with Gazprom Marketing and Trading Singapore (GMTS) in 2012 for annual purchases of an average of 2.5 million tonnes of LNG on a delivered basis.</p>

      <p>The initial contract with GMTS was also for supplies from the Yamal project in the Arctic, but the former Russian entity was arranging supplies from elsewhere to cut freight costs as the deal was done on delivered basis, industry sources said earlier this year.</p>

    	<p>By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla</p>
    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Shell said it will ramp up its dividend and share buybacks while keeping oil output steady into 2030, as CEO Wael Sawan moved to regain investor confidence that wavered over its energy transition plan.</p>	
    	<p>Shell will increase its overall shareholder distribution to 30% to 40% of cash flow from operations, from 20% to 30% previously, it said in a new financial framework announced on Wednesday as part of an investor conference in New York.</p>	
    	<p>That includes a 15% dividend boost and an increase in the rate of its share buyback programme from the second quarter, spending $5 billion rather than $4 billion in recent quarters.</p>
      <p>The plan is the linchpin of Sawan's effort to boost Shell's share performance relative to its U.S. peers, which has suffered despite a record $40 billion profit last year.</p>
      <p>The British company has faced concerns that it was shifting away from oil and gas at a time of booming energy prices while returns from its growing renewables and low-carbon businesses remained poor.</p>
      <p>Its shares closed up 0.4%, against a flat index of European oil and gas companies on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Performance, discipline, and simplification will be our guiding principles," said Sawan, who took office in January.</p>
      <p>"We will invest in the models that work – those with the highest returns that play to our strengths," he added in a statement.</p>
      <p>The dividend increase, to around 33 cents per share, is the sixth since Shell slashed its then 47 cent dividend in April 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first cut since the Second World War.</p>
      <p>The higher payout ratio will keep Shell "competitive with peers", RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note.</p>
      <h3>OIL STEADY</h3>
      <p>Shell scrapped its previous target to cut oil output by 20% by 2030 after largely reaching the goal. It produced around 1.5 million barrels per day of oil in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
      <p>It said it will now keep its oil production steady to 2030 and will grow its natural gas business to defend its position as the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) player.</p>
      <p>Capital spending will be in a range of $22 billion to $25 billion per year for 2024 and 2025, after a planned $23 billion to $27 billion range for 2023.</p>
      <p>Shell plans to spend around $40 billion on oil and gas production and trading between 2023-2025, compared with $35 billion on its downstream, renewables and low-energy solutions businesses. Shell's shift follows a similar move by rival BP earlier this year when CEO Bernard Looney rowed back from plans to cut its oil and gas output by 40% by 2030.</p>
      <p>Sawan, a 48-year-old Canadian-Lebanese national who previously headed Shell's oil, gas and renewables divisions, has in recent months scrapped several projects, including offshore wind, hydrogen and biofuels, due to weak return forecasts.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday it said it is also conducting a strategic review of energy and chemicals assets on Bukom and Jurong Island in Singapore and is seeking to sell its stake in the Miro refinery in Germany.</p>
      <p>NET ZERO Speculation that Sawan was set to slow Shell's plans to reduce greenhouse gas emission and shift to renewables have angered climate-focused investors.</p>
      <p>Shell has said it remains committed to slashing emissions to net zero by 2050.</p>
      <p>Shell's climate pledges are based on emissions intensity reductions per unit of energy produced, which means absolute emissions can rise even if the headline intensity metric falls.</p>
      <p>It currently has a target to cut its 2030 emissions intensity, including from the combustion of the fuels it sells, by 20%.</p>
      <p>Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels to stand any chance of realising the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>
      <p>Shell also faces a Dutch court ruling ordering the company to drastically cut emissions. It has appealed against the decision.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Biodiesel fans will be keenly awaiting an announcement this week by the US Environmental Protection Agency on how much of the renewable product must be blended into the nation’s fuel supply. Meanwhile, European natural gas futures retreated after posting the biggest weekly surge since August. Here are five charts to consider in global commodity markets.</p>
    	<h3>Natural Gas</h3>
      <p>Gas prices in Europe plunged on Monday, giving back some of last week’s advance and highlighting ongoing volatility in the market. Benchmark Dutch front-month gas’s 35% surge last week — the most since August — came as hotter weather forecasts signaled stronger demand than previously expected amid signs of budding competition from Asia for the heating and power-generation fuel.</p>	
    	<p>That pushed the US dollar equivalent futures contract to a premium over the Japan-Korea Marker, the Asian benchmark, for the first time since mid-May. Both Europe and Asia compete for liquefied natural gas shipments from the US and the Middle East.</p>	
    	<h3>Renewables</h3>
      <p>Renewable diesel production is taking off in the US — with capacity on track to reach about 385,000 barrels per day by 2025 — more than double where things stood at the end of 2022, according to Energy Information Administration data. Generous federal incentives have helped drive the surge in production of the green fuel made from crops and animal fat that can be substituted for petroleum-based diesel.</p>
      <p>The EPA is set to decide this week how much biomass-based diesel it should mandate be mixed into the country’s fuel supply in 2023, 2024 and 2025, amid concern that proposed targets lowballed potential production.</p>
      <h3>Agriculture</h3>
      <p>The US corn belt will be a major focus for markets with the release of crop conditions on Monday and the weekly drought report on Thursday. Corn crops experiencing moderate to intense drought have been steadily increasing to 45% of the total.</p>
      <p>That compares with just 19% for the same time a year ago. The US Department of Agriculture last week refrained from changing its estimates for domestic corn yields, despite the dry weather. That will leave traders guessing about the state of the harvest until the next estimate is published in July. Corn for December delivery is down 11% this year in Chicago.</p>
      <h3>Metals</h3>
      <p>Cobalt will surely be in focus this week as the Democratic Republic of Congo — the world’s largest producer of the key battery ingredient — hosts a mining conference. The price of the metal used in electric-car batteries and electronics has fallen almost 30% this year to $13.90 a pound, according to Fastmarkets data, amid lackluster global demand and rising supply from new No. 2 producer Indonesia. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting softness for battery metals including cobalt, lithium and nickel in the second half of 2023 amid an oversupply.</p>
      <h3>Oil</h3>
      <p>The slump in oil continued into a third week amid ongoing concerns over demand as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its price forecast again. Despite shocks from surprise production cuts by both OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia, futures have slumped about 15% this year in a constant struggle for momentum amid a slower-than-expected recovery in China.</p>
      <p>Oil traders will be closely watching monthly reports this week from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Tuesday and the International Energy Agency on Wednesday for clues on the trajectory for supply and demand, which may weigh further on prices.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices dipped on Monday as the dollar and bond yields firmed, while traders braced for a busy week of key U.S. inflation prints and major central bank policy meetings, with all eyes on the Federal Reserve.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold fell 0.4% to $1,953.77 per ounce by 1:40 p.m. EDT (1740 GMT). U.S. gold futures settled 0.4% lower at $1,969.70.</p>	
    	<p>The dollar index edged up 0.2%, making gold more expensive for overseas buyers, while a rise in U.S. Treasury yields made zero-yielding bullion less attractive. [USD/] [US/]</p>
      <p>"Going into this week with gold is almost like a coin flip," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.</p>
      <p>The U.S. consumer price index for May is due at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, with the producer price index reading due on Wednesday morning ahead of the Fed's interest rate decision later that day.</p>
      <p>"The fact that if we get a halt on rate hikes would push gold up pretty big despite a hawkish (Fed) statement," Haberkorn said.</p>
      <p>Markets priced in a 76% chance of the Fed keeping rates unchanged, and a 71% chance of a hike in July, according to CME's Fedwatch tool.</p>
      <p>The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will deliver their rate decisions on Thursday and Friday, respectively.</p>
      <p>"Gold is trading on the assumption that U.S. interest rates will stay where they are with any hike likely to send the precious metal crashing down towards $1,900 an ounce," Kinesis Money analyst Rupert Rowling said in a note.</p>
      <p>Silver fell 1.3% to $23.95 per ounce, while platinum dipped 1.92% to a two-month low at $989.67.</p>
      <p>Palladium, used in emissions-controlling devices in cars, gained 1.4% to $1,342.27, after hitting its lowest since May 2019 on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Palladium could head back above $1,500 in the fourth quarter of this year owing to improving automotive production, however this is currently under pressure from destocking by the automakers," said Metals Focus analyst Jacob Smith.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- A buying spree in ETFs tied to natural gas is spurring concern that the securities risk destabilizing a market that up until now has been the province of energy pros.</p>
    	<p>Hedge funds and other investors have piled into the exchange-traded funds, known by their tickers BOIL and UNG, seeking to profit off fluctuations in prices for the fuel used for cooking, heating and generating electricity. The funds’ combined net assets are now $2.1 billion, twice the level of just six months ago.</p>	
    	<p>The eye-popping growth for the two funds left them owning about 30% of the front-month futures contracts for gas earlier this week, a ratio many multiples of what’s typical for ETFs tied to commodities futures.</p>	
    	<p>While that isn’t a problem when holdings and prices are stable, any abrupt buying or selling by those ETFs could lead to wild swings for the fuel, exacerbating volatility in a market already beset by more stomach-churning ups and downs than most.</p>
      <p>“It’s become dangerously big,” said Gary Cunningham, a director at Tradition Energy, an independent energy risk management and procurement adviser. “If something significant were to happen to it, its positions are so large that they can literally move the market.”</p>
      <p>ETFs aren’t supposed to move the market, just trade in line with the underlying asset. They’re designed to be highly liquid securities similar to stocks, ideal for giving investors exposure to commodities like natural gas that usually are traded by industry professionals using more complex futures and options contracts.</p>
      <p>But if they get too big, they can start influencing the underlying market instead of just reflecting it. In fact, that’s what happened with natural gas in 2009 when speculators trying to profit from UNG’s need to roll over contracts helped boost volatility to a three-year high as prices surged. The fund was temporarily forced to stop creating new shares because it could no longer expand its holdings in futures markets.</p>
      <p>A similar occurrence came in 2020 when oil prices briefly went negative. The United States Oil Fund, a major ETF in the sector, was accused of contributing to market mayhem as it tried to roll over futures contracts amid volatile prices. Regulators eventually ordered the fund to change strategy in the wake of the turmoil.</p>
      <p>In the gas market this year, investors put nearly $1.9 billion into BOIL, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas fund, more than any other US commodity-focused ETF. Its assets jumped almost five-fold from a year ago.</p>
      <p>In early June, it held more than a fifth of New York Mercantile Exchange gas futures for July delivery, along with over-the-counter swap gas contracts. On June 7, BOIL started rolling its contracts into September, reducing its position in the front-month futures.</p>
      <p>The fund is particularly volatile because it uses leverage to double the daily moves in the underlying gas contracts, a tactic that active traders love because of the opportunity to profit from the swings but which can be dangerous for mom-and-pop buyers unaware of the implications. An investor who bought the fund at last year’s peak in June would have lost 98% of their money if they held it until now.</p>
      <p>UNG, formally United States Natural Gas Fund LP, has seen inflows of almost $1.2 billion this year. The fund holds almost 10% of July gas contracts.</p>
      <p>Neither ETF is designed for buy-and-hold investors because they’re structured in a way that will almost always lose money. They must roll their contracts forward as the front-month expires, and since longer-term deliveries are typically pricier, that erodes returns.</p>
      <p>Flows into gas ETFs surged during the US winter months as predominantly mild temperatures curbed heating demand, sending prices for the fuel plunging from August’s 14-year highs. While the buying appetite has since diminished, flows have remained positive for six straight months.</p>
      <p>On a daily basis, BOIL flows have tended to move in an inverse direction to prices, meaning investors are net buyers when prices are down and net sellers when prices are up. That’s because some traders seem to be using BOIL as a hedging tool, so they need to add more shares when prices fall as a way to maintain their hedge’s value, according to James Seyffart, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.</p>
      <p>“You also have traders and people trying to time the market that will pour in as the price collapses, trying to hit a jackpot moment when it flies higher,” Seyffart said. “So if natural gas turns around you will see outflows from this product, which will be traders taking profits and hedgers taking off some of the hedge they no longer need.”</p>
      <p>There’s limited transparency into who exactly or even what kinds of investors hold the ETFs, and their issuers declined to comment on ownership.</p>
      <p>UNG’s issuer, United States Commodity Funds, said the inflows to the fund are consistent with historical patterns. “When prices are volatile and/or low, we believe traders see potential opportunities,” Chief Marketing Officer Katie Rooney said in an email.</p>
      <p>John Hyland, a former executive who oversaw commodity-linked products including USO and UNG as chief investment officer at the firm, estimates that more than 80% of gas ETFs are held by hedge funds and other professionals, with retail investors almost certainly a “small minority of the shareholder base.”</p>
      <p>“I always joked that 80% of our shares are held by firms having a mailing address in Connecticut, a tax domicile in the Cayman Islands, and a Greek or Roman god in their name,” Hyland said in an email. “But I am not exactly sure what they do for a living.”</p>
      <p>Investors in gas ETFs risk making the commodity, already the “king of volatility,” even more prone to swings that exacerbate the trends dictated by supply and demand fundamentals, according to Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA.</p>
      <p>“It’s a herd mentality,” Yawger said.</p>

    	<p>Spot gold fell 0.3% to $1,961.39 per ounce by 3:15 p.m. EDT (1915 GMT). But it is headed for a 0.7% weekly climb, helped by a 1.5% jump on Thursday after a surge in U.S. weekly jobless claims.</p>

      <p>"Gold is oscillating in a $1,940-$1,990 range and is likely to remain so until inflation data and the Fed result next week," said Tai Wong, a New York-based independent metals trader, adding that bullion remains "more sensitive to weak or dovish economic data."</p>
      <p>The dollar index bounced off two-week lows, making gold expensive for overseas buyers, while higher 10-year Treasury yields made zero-yield bullion less attractive.</p>

    	<p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday to record a second straight weekly decline, as disappointing Chinese data added to doubts about demand growth after Saudi Arabia's weekend decision to cut output.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures fell $1.17, or 1.5%, to settle at $74.79 a barrel, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.12, or 1.6%, to $70.17 a barrel.</p>	
    	<p>Both benchmarks lost more than $3 on Thursday after a media report that a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal was imminent and would result in more supply. Prices pared losses after both countries denied the report, ending about a dollar a barrel lower.</p>
      <p>"Thursday's price moves show how fragile oil is," said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.</p>
      <p>"The Saudi cut lifted prices slightly, and then the chatter of the potential return of Iranian barrels saw a large drop. Long investors are likely on the sidelines until larger oil inventory declines become visible," he said.</p>
      <p>Oil prices had risen early in the week, buoyed by Saudi Arabia's pledge over the weekend to cut more output on top of the cuts agreed earlier with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.</p>
      <p>However, a rise in U.S. fuel stocks and weak Chinese export data have weighed on the markets.</p>
      <p>"As we move deeper into the summer driving season in the Northern Hemisphere, demand will be a key factor in determining whether limited inventories must drive prices higher, or soft demand leads to lower prices," said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management.</p>
      <p>China's factory gate prices fell at the fastest pace in seven years in May and quicker than forecasts, as faltering demand weighed on a slowing manufacturing sector and cast a cloud over the fragile economic recovery.</p>
      <p>Some analysts expect oil prices to rise if the U.S. Federal Reserve pauses hiking interest rates at its next meeting over June 13-14. The Fed's decision may also influence Saudi Arabia's next move, analysts said.</p>
      <p>"The important thing is that despite those changes (Saudi, US-Iran) to output, oil remains below $80, no doubt much to the disappointment of the Saudis," said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam.</p>
      <p>"What comes next may well depend on the inflation data and interest rate decisions over the coming weeks," he said.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices climbed more than 1% on Thursday as the dollar and bond yields slipped after data showed U.S. weekly jobless claims surged last week, cementing expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate hiking cycle.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold rose 1.2% to $1,962.49 per ounce by 01:42 p.m. EDT (1742 GMT).</p>	
    	<p>U.S. gold futures settled up 1% at $1,978.60.</p>
      <p>The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits surged last week, suggesting that the labour market was slowing amid mounting risks of a recession.</p>
      <p>"This data shows a further weakness in the U.S. economy, which is good news for gold as it will allow the Fed to be on hold," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.</p>
      <p>"If we get further softness in inflation, if the Fed holds and they really don't signal a strong likelihood of a hike for the next meeting, then there is a good case for gold to edge higher."</p>
      <p>Following the jobs data, the dollar slipped 0.7% to a two-week low against its rivals, making gold less expensive for other currency holders, while benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields tumbled.</p>
      <p>Money market participants now see a 71% chance that the U.S. central bank will skip raising interest rates at its policy meeting next week, according to the CME's Fedwatch tool.</p>
      <p>Lower U.S. interest rates put pressure on the dollar and bond yields, increasing the appeal of non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>The U.S. consumer inflation report for May, due on June 13, could provide more clarity about the health of the world's largest economy.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of uncertainty and you could see it in gold prices, if yields really start to back off here, then gold could move much higher," said Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist, RJO Futures.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices eased in a narrow range on Wednesday as the dollar held firm and traders refrained from taking big bets as they looked for clear signals on the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate path.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold ticked lower 0.2% to $1,959.19 per ounce by 06:37 GMT but held a $8 range. U.S. gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,975.00.</p>	
    	<p>"Gold traders are waiting for clear signals on the economy that will warrant either a pause or a continuation of the tightening cycle," Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst at OANDA said.</p>
      <p>Pockets of weakness, combined with resilient labour market figures and stubborn inflation, "don't help gold one way or another," he added.</p>
      <p>Non-interest-bearing bullion tends to become less attractive in a high interest rate environment.</p>
      <p>Supply gain pressures continued to abate in May, the New York Fed said in a report on Tuesday, further reducing what had been one of the key forces driving up inflation pressures around the world.</p>
      <p>The U.S. consumer price report for May, due on June 13, ahead of the Fed meeting, will provide investors more clarity about the health of the world's largest economy.</p>
      <p>"If the Fed ends up looking more hawkish because inflation is more durable, now that headwinds like the debt ceiling are out of the way... the risk is significant," said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.</p>
      <p>Fed fund futures indicate traders have priced in an 81.7% chance that the U.S central bank will hold interest rates in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool. However, they see nearly 53% odds of another hike in July.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, exports from top bullion consumer China shrank much faster than expected in May and imports fell, albeit at a slower pace, as manufacturers struggled to find demand abroad and domestic consumption remained sluggish.</p>
      <p>Spot silver fell 0.5% to $23.4639 per ounce, platinum steadied at $1,031.40. Palladium flat at $1,412.22.</p>

    	<p>TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Oil fell for a second day on Wednesday as concerns over global economic headwinds deepened, erasing the price gains booked after top crude exporter Saudi Arabia's surprise weekend pledge to deepen output cuts.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures were down 56 cents, or 0.7%, at $75.73 a barrel at 0705 GMT. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 52 cents, also 0.7%, to $71.22 a barrel.</p>	
    	<p>Both benchmarks jumped more than $1 on Monday after Saudi Arabia's decision over the weekend to reduce output by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 9 million bpd in July.</p>
      <p>"The fears of recession, as more and more sombre economic readings point towards a slowdown, have kept a lid on oil prices, eroding all OPEC+'s efforts to keep prices afloat," Priyanka Sachdeva, an analyst at Phillip Nova, said in a note.</p>
      <p>U.S. gasoline inventories rose by about 2.4 million barrels and distillates inventories were up by about 4.5 million barrels in the week ended June 2, market sources said on Tuesday, citing American Petroleum Institute figures.</p>
      <p>The unexpected buildup of fuel stockpiles raised concerns over consumption by the world's top oil user, especially as travel demand grew during the Memorial Day weekend.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday that U.S crude oil production this year would rise faster and demand increases would cool compared to prior expectations.</p>
      <p>"The market has digested the news of Saudi's production cut and investors are now reluctant to take a large position because of mixed economic forecasts and indicators in the United States and China," said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities.</p>
      <p>China's official data showed on Wednesday that its exports shrank much faster than expected in May and imports fell, albeit at a slower pace, as manufacturers struggled to find demand abroad and domestic consumption remained sluggish.</p>
      <p>The data also showed crude oil imports into China, the world's largest oil importer, in May rose to their third-highest monthly level ever as refiners built up inventories.</p>
      <p>A JP Morgan note showed forward crude cover in the country has climbed, indicating refiners have not increased processing rates but are instead storing oil.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, some analysts expected Saudi Arabia's voluntary cut, the biggest in the kingdom in years, would put a floor under oil prices, although it was unlikely to underpin a sustainable price increase into the high $80s-low $90s per barrel range.</p>
      <p>"We expect oil prices to test upside as we enter the summer driving season in the United States," Kikukawa said, adding that tighter global supply and U.S. plans to buy crude to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would limit the downside.</p>

    	<p>In this article, we discuss the 10 best copper stocks to buy. If you want to read about some more copper stocks, go directly to 5 Best Copper Stocks to Buy.</p>
    	<p>The copper mining industry is experiencing significant market trends that have far-reaching implications for the global landscape. These trends are crucial for understanding the current dynamics and future prospects of the industry. The demand for copper has been steadily rising, driven by various factors. Rapid urbanization and industrialization in emerging economies, such as China and India, have fueled the need for copper in infrastructure development, construction projects, and electrical wiring. Additionally, the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems, and advancements in technology, including 5G networks, are driving the demand for copper as a vital component in these applications.</p>	
    	<p>However, the copper mining industry is facing supply constraints due to several factors. Aging mines, declining ore grades, and operational challenges in existing mining operations have led to a slowdown in production growth. Furthermore, geopolitical factors, including trade tensions, labor strikes, and regulatory changes, can disrupt the supply chain and affect the availability of copper in the market. In addition, environmental sustainability has become a significant focus in the mining industry, including copper mining. Companies are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize water usage.</p>	
    	<p>The copper mining industry is also embracing technological advancements to improve efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. Automation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics are being utilized to optimize mining operations, reduce costs, and enhance safety. Furthermore, innovations in mineral exploration techniques are helping identify new copper deposits and improve the efficiency of resource estimation. The emphasis on responsible sourcing and ethical supply chains is gaining momentum in the copper mining industry. Companies are increasingly expected to adhere to strict social and environmental standards, ensuring the ethical extraction and processing of copper.</p>
      <p>Consumers and investors are demanding transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain, prompting mining companies to adopt responsible sourcing practices and certifications. Understanding these market trends is vital for stakeholders in the copper mining industry. Mining companies need to anticipate and adapt to changing market dynamics to ensure long-term sustainability and profitability. Governments and regulatory bodies play a crucial role in setting policies that balance environmental concerns with the industry's economic significance.</p>
      <p>The global market for copper is projected to experience significant growth, with an expected increase from $160.7 billion in 2022 to $176.74 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.0%. However, the recent Russia-Ukraine war has had disruptive effects on the global economy, particularly in the short term.</p>
      <p>This conflict has led to economic sanctions, commodity price surges, and supply chain disruptions, resulting in inflation and impacting various markets worldwide. Nonetheless, the copper market is anticipated to continue expanding, reaching $254.33 billion by 2027, with a CAGR of 9.5%.</p>
      <p>Within the copper industry, ore mining is a lucrative business. It involves a complex process that begins with extracting ore containing less than 1% copper and concludes with the production of cathodes. These cathodes are sheets of copper that are 99.99% pure and are eventually transformed into everyday items.</p>
      <p>Copper oxide and copper sulfide are the two main types of ores found in the mining process. The copper ore mining market encompasses several countries, including Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. These countries are involved in the extraction and production of copper ore.</p>
      <p>In 2022, the Asia-Pacific region emerged as the largest market for copper ore mining. The copper ore mining industry encompasses different types, such as the refining industry, metal processing industry, chemical industry, and other related sectors.</p>
      <p>The refining industry involves the production and delivery of oil and oil products. The global copper market is expected to witness substantial growth despite the short-term disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. The market is driven by the demand for copper in various industries, including construction, transportation, and electronics.</p>
      <p>While the ongoing conflict poses challenges, the overall outlook for the copper market remains positive, with the industry continuing to evolve and meet the demand for this versatile metal. Some of the companies that are at the forefront of copper production and could cash in on the expected boom for the metal in the long-term include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM).</p>

    	<p>By Arundhati Sarkar</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices steadied in a tight range on Tuesday as optimism that the U.S. central bank will not hike interest rates this month kept the dollar under pressure.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold held its ground at $1,960.89 per ounce by 0239 GMT. U.S. gold futures edged 0.1% higher to $1,976.80.</p>	
    	<p>The dollar index eased 0.1%, making gold a more favourable bet among overseas investors. The yield on 10-year Treasuries also retreated after weaker U.S. services sector data on Monday.</p>
      <p>"(However,) the Fed's data-dependent stance will mean that rate expectations may continue to see huge swings due to its higher sensitivity to incoming economic data, with a key look-ahead being the U.S. May CPI report next week," said Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG.</p>
      <p>A survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. services sector barely grew in May as new orders slowed, pushing a measure of prices paid by businesses for inputs to a three-year low, which could aid the Fed's fight against inflation.</p>
      <p>Lower interest rates tend to lift gold as it reduces the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset.</p>
      <p>"(But) the constantly-shifting narrative around how high the terminal rate will have to be and the timeline for rate cuts could challenge gold prices' upside for now, until greater clarity is being presented on that front," Jun Rong said.</p>
      <p>Traders have priced in an 76% chance that the Fed will hold interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>Indicative of sentiment, SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.15% to 939.56 tonnes on Monday from 938.11 tonnes on Friday.</p>
      <p>Spot silver fell 0.1% to $23.5632 per ounce, platinum steadied at $1,030.64, and palladium rose 0.3% to $1,418.24.</p>

    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices rose by more than $1 a barrel on Monday after top crude exporter Saudi Arabia pledged to cut production by a further 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from July to counter macroeconomic headwinds that have depressed markets.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude futures were up $1.37, or 1.8%, at $77.50 a barrel by 1100 GMT after touching a session high of $78.73.</p>	
    	<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed by $1.39, or 1.9%, to $73.13 after hitting an intraday high of $75.06.</p>
      <p>Both contracts extended gains of more than 2% on Friday after the Saudi energy ministry said the kingdom's output would drop to 9 million bpd in July from about 10 million bpd in May. The cut is Saudi Arabia's biggest in years.</p>	
    	<p>The voluntary cut is on top of a broader deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia to limit supply into 2024 as the OPEC+ producer group seeks to boost flagging oil prices.</p>
      <p>OPEC+ pumps about 40% of the world's crude and has cut its output target by a total of 3.66 million bpd, amounting to 3.6% of global demand.</p>	
    	<p>"Saudi remains keener than most other members in terms of ensuring oil prices above $80 per barrel, which is essential for balancing its own fiscal budget for the year," said Suvro Sarkar, leader of the energy sector team at DBS Bank.</p>
      <p>SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said the market reaction on Monday was relatively muted after the previous cut by OPEC+ failed to prop up prices for long.</p>	
    	<p>"The oil price is ticking carefully upwards today as investors are cautious after having burned their fingers in the (previous) production cut-induced rally to (almost) $90 a barrel, which later faltered."</p>
      <p>Consultancy Rystad Energy said the additional Saudi cut is likely to deepen the market deficit to more than 3 million bpd in July, which could push prices higher in the coming weeks.</p>	
    	<p>Goldman Sachs analysts said the meeting was "moderately bullish" for oil markets and could boost December 2023 Brent prices by between $1 and $6 a barrel depending on how long Saudi Arabia maintains output at 9 million bpd over the next six months.</p>
      <p>"The immediate market impact of this Saudi cut is likely lower, as drawing inventories takes time, and the market likely already put some meaningful probability on a cut today," the bank's analysts added.</p>	
    	<p>Many of the OPEC+ reductions will have little real impact, however, as the lower targets for Russia, Nigeria and Angola bring them into line with their actual production levels.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was allowed to raise output targets by 200,000 bpd to 3.22 million bpd to reflect its larger production capacity.</p>

    	<p>ALGIERS, Algeria—Exxon XOM 1.15%increase; green up pointing triangle Mobil and Chevron CVX 1.02%increase; green up pointing triangle are in advanced negotiations with Algeria on a deal that would allow the U.S. energy giants to drill for the first time in the gas-rich North African nation, according to the Algerian energy minister and people familiar with the discussions.</p>
    	<p>The deals, which the energy minister said could be complete by the end of the year, would give the companies a foothold in a country that is an increasingly important supplier of natural gas to Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>	
    	<p>Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil-and-gas company, is negotiating agreements with the two companies that would focus on conventional gas and Algeria’s enormous reserves of shale gas, believed to be the third largest in the world.</p>	
    	<p>“I am pushing Sonatrach,” said Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab, “because we need to increase our volumes.”</p>
      <p>Europe has sharply cut its purchases of Russian gas over the past year, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September means the continent may never again buy large volumes from Russia. Algeria, one of the world’s largest producers of natural gas, has three pipeline connections to Europe that give it a competitive advantage over distant suppliers, such as the U.S. and Qatar, that ship liquefied natural gas to Europe.</p>
      <p>Exxon and Chevron are looking to put huge cash piles to work, after reaping record profits last year as they rode surging oil prices. The companies have mostly heeded shareholders’ calls for austerity and investor payouts through buybacks and dividends, but are once more on the hunt for new sources of production.</p>
      <p>The industry’s investment options have narrowed, heightening Algeria’s attractiveness. The U.S. shale patch has begun to show growth limitations, and some costly frontier-drilling projects haven’t panned out, including in Brazil, where Exxon ended a multibillion-dollar drilling campaign after a series of disappointing wells.</p>
      <p>Energy companies are also betting that demand for natural gas will continue to rise in the coming years as nations use it rather than coal to generate electricity as part of their plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Arkab met with Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth at a global energy conference in Houston earlier this year, while executives from Sonatrach met with counterparts from Exxon, Arkab said.</p>
      <p>“We have many basins, we’re not going to put them in the same one,” he said.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Exxon said the company has been in talks with Sonatrach and declined to discuss additional details. Chevron said it has signed an agreement with Algerian authorities that allows it to access data about three oil-and-gas basins: Ahnet in the south, Gourara in the center of the country and Berkine in the east next to the borders with Libya and Tunisia.</p>
      <p>Energy companies have been hunting for gas production with easy access to European markets since the war began. Italian oil-and-gas company Eni has been investing in Algeria and fields offshore Egypt and Cyprus to produce gas that can be delivered to Europe; in January, it announced an $8 billion deal with Libya’s national oil company to produce gas from offshore fields in the Mediterranean.</p>
      <p>Chevron has partnered with Eni in Egypt and is working to start up the Leviathan project in the Mediterranean near Israel. It has teamed up with Shell to develop the Aphrodite gas field offshore Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Algeria’s territory with proven oil and gas reserves stretches across 1.5 million square kilometers, Arkab said, an area roughly the size of Alaska. The heart of the country’s gas industry is Hassi R’Mel, a field around 340 miles south of Algiers that is one of the largest in the world.</p>
      <p>That field, however, has been producing since the early 1960s, and analysts question whether it can increase output significantly. Algeria needs to start producing in large areas of the country that haven’t been exploited and increase recovery rates on fields that are currently in production, Algerian officials say. There are plenty of opportunities: Only 47% of the 1.5 million square kilometers are being exploited, Arkab said.</p>
      <p>“We still have 53% to develop in conventional gas,” he said. “That will dramatically increase our production.”</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold slipped on Friday as hotter-than-expected U.S. jobs data lifted Treasury yields, but was on track for a weekly gain as a higher unemployment reading kept alive hopes that the Federal Reserve would pause interest rate hikes.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold was down 1.4% at $1,951.13 per ounce by 14:17 EDT (1817 GMT), after hitting a seven-session high earlier. U.S. gold futures settled 1.3% higher at $1,969.6.</p>	
    	<p>Bullion has gained 0.2% so far this week, and is set to break a three-week losing streak.</p>
      <p>U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by 339,000 in May, beating expectations for an increase of 190,000, but the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from a 53-year low of 3.4% in April.</p>
      <p>Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose, and the dollar ticked up, making the greenback-priced, zero-interest-bearing bullion less attractive. [US/]</p>
      <p>"The fact that the data is a little mixed is going to cancel itself out where the Fed most likely will look through that data and follow through with whatever they were planning on doing, which right now seems to be a pause," said Everett Millman, chief market analyst at Gainesville Coins.</p>
      <p>Traders priced in a 70% chance that Fed policymakers will leave rates unchanged later this month.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker said on Thursday U.S. central bankers should not raise interest rates at their next meeting.</p>
      <p>Higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding bullion.</p>
      <p>"This optimism around interest rates has offset any potential losses for gold now that the U.S. has reached agreement on its debt ceiling and avoided defaulting," Kinesis Money analyst Rupert Rowling wrote in a note.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a bipartisan legislation backed by President Joe Biden to lift the country's debt ceiling.</p>
      <p>Spot silver, also set to gain for the week, fell 1.2% to $23.62 per ounce.</p>
      <p>Platinum fell 0.7% to $999.15 and palladium advanced 0.8% to $1,405.90, both set for weekly losses.</p>

        <li>Meanwhile, oil flows from Saudi Arabia to India have plunged to a 28-month low.</li>

      </ul>
	    <p>India snapped up a record volume of Russian oil last month, while flows from Saudi Arabia have fallen to their lowest level since 2021.</p>
	    <p>Russia, which surpassed Saudi Arabia as India's top oil supplier in October last year, sold 1.96 million barrels of crude a day to India during the month of May, according to Vortexa data cited by Bloomberg. That's around 15% higher than the 1.67 million barrels a day sold to India in April.</p>	
	    <p>Saudi Arabian oil shipments, meanwhile, fell to their lowest level since February 2021, marking a 28-month low.</p>	
	    <p>That's largely due to ever-steeper discounts on Russian crude, which has led allies like China and India to ramp up Russian oil purchases tremendously. The average cost of Russian crude shipments was $68.21 a barrel in April, according to data from India's Ministry of Commerce, marking the lowest price tag on Russia's crude since the nation first invaded Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has bemoaned the amounts of cheap Russian oil making their way to market, as it pushes oil prices lower for all suppliers. Saudi officials complained to Russia as oil prices dipped below $81 a barrel, a key break-even level for sellers, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
      <p>Some estimates show that Russia's economy is also struggling as it sells energy commodities at a discount, with cheap crude sales driving energy revenues lower and deepening its budget deficit. The nation's oil and gas revenue crashed nearly 50% at the start of 2023, Russia's finance ministry reported, largely attributing the decline to lower prices for its main oil product as well as falling natural gas exports.</p>

    	<p>BERGEN, Norway (Reuters) - Inspections of Norway's offshore gas pipelines after the Nord Stream blasts found nothing suspicious, an executive at energy major Equinor told Reuters, in the first official word on the security sweep.</p>	
    	<p>However, risks remain after last year's still-unexplained explosions at the Nord Stream pipelines built to carry Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea, warned Jannicke Nilsson, who manages security for Equinor.</p>	
    	<p>Europe's largest gas supplier after a drop in Russian flows last year, Equinor also acts as technical service provider for offshore pipelines operator Gassco. It launched the inspections shortly after the explosions on Sept. 26.</p>
      <p>"We did find the things that we wanted to check, and when we checked it, it was OK," Jannicke Nilsson, Equinor's executive in charge of security, safety and sustainability, said in an interview.</p>
      <p>The company said inspections had been conducted to identify anything out of the ordinary, like damages, foreign objects or any changes to how the pipelines are covered on the seabed.</p>
      <p>Nilsson, who rarely gives interviews, spoke about how the war in Ukraine and the Nord Stream explosions have changed the operations of Norway's largest oil and gas producer.</p>
      <p>Despite underwater inspections not finding any suspicious objects along Norway's key pipelines, the threat of an attack was still present.</p>
      <p>"It's not gone. What happened with Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 is a very clear reminder of how far some people are willing to go," she said.</p>
      <p>NATO HELP</p>
      <p>Equinor was working with authorities in Norway, the European Union, Britain and military alliance NATO on what the company can do to prevent such an attack, she added.</p>
      <p>Norway is a member of NATO but not of the European Union.</p>
      <p>Last summer, Norway designated Equinor and Gassco as companies critical to national security, allowing security services to share relevant classified information.</p>
      <p>After the Feb. 24 invasion, some Equinor executives including Nilsson received security clearances from Norwegian authorities, allowing them to read intelligence reports.</p>
      <p>In January, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal went to NATO's headquarters in Brussels to speak about protection of the West's offshore infrastructure, such as pipelines and cables.</p>
      <p>After the Nord Stream blasts, the Norwegian Navy and NATO allies patrolled around offshore oil and gas platforms. In February, NATO established a Critical Undersea Infrastructure Protection Cell to improve cooperation with the industry.</p>
      <p>"If we need assistance, the Norwegian military and NATO would provide resources... they would be here quickly," Nilsson said.</p>
      <p>Onshore, Norway's military posted soldiers to guard major oil and gas processing plants and help police, though their work there has now ended.</p>
      <p>In a show of NATO's and the EU's focus on protecting Europe's gas supplies, their chiefs Jens Stoltenberg and Ursula von der Leyen visited Norway's largest gas producing platform, Troll A, in March.</p>
      <p>"I don't think this could have happened two years ago... because back then we were not seen as that important for European energy security," Nilsson said. "Now they see that gas from Norway and gas from Equinor is key."</p>

    	<p>Traders consider impact of US debt deal and outcome of next Fed meeting on gold prices</p>
    	<p>Gold prices fell on Tuesday while the dollar strengthened as traders anticipate another interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve (Fed).</p>	
    	<p>Gold (CG=F) was trading around $1,973 (£1,586), after dropping to its lowest level since 17 March earlier in the session.</p>	
    	<p>It comes as markets are pricing in a 60% chance of a 25 basis-point hike when the Fed next meets in June, compared with a 26% chance a week earlier, according to trading data from the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>The Fed’s favourite inflation measure raised the rate hike odds after US consumer spending rose 4.4% from April 2022, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed on 26 May.</p>
      <p>Moreover, core inflation, which excludes prices for food and energy, ticked up 4.7% year-over-year.</p>
      <h3>Further downside for gold?</h3>
      <p>Piero Cingari, independent macro analyst, said: “The market implied probability of a June rate hike has risen to 60% now which has led to a strengthening of the dollar. As traders further raise their Fed rate hike bets, the dollar gets a boost and gold retraces.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t rule out further downside in gold prices towards the $1,900-$1,850 region, where buyers could then reappear.</p>
      <p>“Silver (SL=F) I think is more at risk of downside, because it has an even higher inverse correlation with the dollar and Fed interest rates relative to gold.”</p>
      <h3>Traders back riskier assets</h3>
      <p>Optimism over a US-debt deal agreement has also weighed on gold prices as investors once again gravitate towards riskier assets, after lawmakers said they had reached a tentative agreement to raise the $31.4tn debt ceiling and avert a default.</p>
      <p>Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said: “In the commodity space, the shining metal is feeling further pressure today as traders continue to back riskier assets, which is taking some shine away from the precious metal.</p>
      <p>“Gold traders also know that the Fed is very much itching to increase rates further, and the yield on the two-year Treasury yield is clearly indicating that another rate hike is more than likely to happen. So the dollar index continues to pick up momentum,” he said.</p>
      <p>Doug Turner at Kinesis Money also noted how the stability of gold has been further exacerbated by the ripple effects of the US regional banking crisis, which initially impacted the gold price, and the inclination of investors to explore “superior-performing assets” following gold's surge to the $2080 mark in early May.</p>
      <p>“However, it is crucial to note that the current decline in gold prices doesn't necessarily signify a longer-term downtrend, but is more likely a temporary consolidation period driven by the aforementioned macroeconomic influences,” Turner added.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Tensions are rising between Saudi Arabia and Russia as Moscow keeps pumping huge volumes of cheaper crude into the market that is undermining Riyadh’s efforts to bolster energy prices, people familiar with the matter say. </p>
    	<p>Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has expressed its anger to Russia for not following through fully on its pledge to throttle production in response to Western sanctions, the people said.</p>	
    	<p>Saudi officials have complained to senior Russian officials and asked them to respect the agreed cuts, the people said.</p>	
    	<p>The friction is very apparent between the world’s two biggest oil producers ahead of a crucial meeting between members of OPEC and a group of Russia-led oil producers, collectively known as OPEC+, in Vienna on June 4, the people said. The cartel is set to decide on a production plan for the second half of the year amid growing concerns about a slowing global economy crimping energy demand.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Saudi energy minister issued a warning to oil speculators, signaling to the market that a further production cut was on the table amid worries over the latest buildup in short positions and Russia’s failure to meet its promised voluntary cuts. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said oil prices were approaching “economically justified” levels, indicating that there might not be a need for an immediate change to the group’s production policy.</p>
      <p>The OPEC+ meeting comes after Saudi Arabia, Russia and other OPEC+ members in early April said they would reduce output in a move that was expected to prop up oil prices. Riyadh started cutting production this month. Moscow at the time said it would extend unilateral curbs that took effect in March to the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Now, the latest available data indicates that Russia continues to pump large volumes of oil into the market, which has helped maximize income for its beleaguered economy but added to a global surplus, industry officials and traders say.</p>
      <p>Oil prices are down about 10% from where they stood in early April despite the Saudi-led intervention and sharply down from the highs they hit following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine early last year. Friday, Brent, the international oil contract, rose 0.9% to $76.95 a barrel.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear if Saudi Arabia will take any immediate action that would affect the energy alliance with Russia. Frictions between Riyadh and Moscow aren’t new to OPEC+. In March 2020, oil prices collapsed after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on an emergency plan to address a supply glut. After the disagreement, Saudi Arabia embarked on a price war in an attempt to grab market share from Russia.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia and Russia are allies in a broad effort by oil producers to prop up energy prices. It has drawn rebuke from the White House, which called the decision shortsighted and suggested OPEC+ was actively supporting Russia pay for its war in Ukraine. Yet beyond oil, their partnership has yielded little so far when it comes to security cooperation, trade or investment.</p>
      <p>Last week, Saudi Arabia invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend the annual Arab League summit as a special guest. The kingdom is one of the many countries offering to mediate an end to the war. It helped negotiate a high-profile prisoner swap last year between Russia and Ukraine and announced $400 million in humanitarian aid for Kyiv.</p>
      <p>The energy ministries of Saudi Arabia and Russia didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak issued a statement earlier this month saying Moscow was abiding by its voluntary pledge to cut oil output by 500,000 barrels a day from March until the end of the year. Moscow has said it would cut its oil output by around 5% after the Group of Seven imposed price caps on Russian oil and oil products.</p>
      <p>“Taking into account the unfounded speculation in the press regarding oil production levels, Russia reaffirms its full commitment to and implementation of voluntary oil production cut levels,” Novak said.</p>
      <p>Russia’s Energy Ministry in recent weeks has also reached out to trade publications to explain it had to delay shutting down some oil wells due to exceptionally freezing weather in parts of the country. The ministry said the country had still managed to cut 400,000 barrels a day in early May—close to the level it had pledged to curb, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Last week, it also pressed secondary sources to alter their estimates of its oil production, but the agencies rebuffed the requests, these people said.</p>
      <p>There is no specific requirement that Russia accurately report its production but the discrepancy adds to tensions within OPEC+ over whether to cut output further.</p>
      <p>Western sanctions on Russian fossil fuels are accelerating the shift in global energy flows, with China and India increasingly taking advantage of Russian oil discounts and Middle Eastern suppliers redirecting their crude to Europe.</p>
      <p>In March, Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia as China’s top oil supplier, while last month India’s imports of Russian oil exceeded combined flows from Saudi Arabia and Iraq for the first time ever, according to data from Vortexa, a data-commodity company.</p>
      <p>Saudi officials and other people familiar with Saudi oil policy say Riyadh is under pressure to maintain higher oil prices with its budget requiring an estimated $81 a barrel—about $5 more than current levels. The kingdom needs to pay for massive development projects at home, some of which are so big that the Saudis call them gigaprojects. These include a Red Sea resort the size of Belgium with Maldives-style hotels hovering above the water and a $500 billion futuristic, high-tech city in the desert that is 33 times bigger than New York City.</p>
      <p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, is halfway through an ambitious plan to use his country’s gusher of oil revenue to transform its economy, rework its physical landscape and upend its conservative culture. As prices hit $100 a barrel last year following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the kingdom accelerated those efforts, which are financed largely by the $650 billion sovereign-wealth fund chaired by Mohammed.</p>
      <p>In recent months, Saudi economic advisers have privately warned senior policy makers that the kingdom needs elevated oil prices for the next five years to keep spending billions of dollars on projects that have so far attracted meager investment from abroad.</p>

    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices ticked up on Friday, as the market weighed conflicting messages on supply from Russia and Saudi Arabia ahead of the next OPEC+ policy meeting.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude was up 54 cents at $76.80 a barrel at 1159 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 67 cents to $72.50 a barrel.</p>	
    	<p>Benchmarks had settled more than $2 per barrel lower on Thursday, after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak played down the prospect of further OPEC+ production cuts at its meeting in Vienna on June 4.</p>
      <p>Both prices were still poised to post a second week of gains. A deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, which appears in sight, would likely boost oil prices.</p>
      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that energy prices were approaching "economically justified" levels, also indicating there could be no immediate change to the group's production policy.</p>
      <p>Their remarks contrasted with comments this week from Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the de-facto leader of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), warning short sellers to "watch out".</p>
      <p>Some investors interpreted that as a signal OPEC+ could consider further output cuts.</p>
      <p>Worries of weaker-than-expected demand growth globally capped gains ahead of an expected rise in oil demand in the second half of the year, especially from China.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, bets on falling oil prices are on the rise.</p>
      <p>The dollar has strengthened this month against a basket of major peers, making dollar-denominated commodities such as oil more expensive for those holding other currencies.</p>

    <p>BENGALURU (Reuters) -Oil prices rose on Tuesday on forecasts for a tighter gasoline market and a warning from the Saudi energy minister to speculators that raised the prospect of further OPEC+ output cuts.</p>	
    <p>Brent crude futures rose 85 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $76.84 a barrel, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) ended at $72.91 a barrel, up 86 cents, or 1.2%.</p>	
    <p>Both benchmarks extended gains to about 2% in post-settlement trade, after figures from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a large draw in crude and gasoline last week, according to market sources. [API/S]</p>
    <p>If official inventories data from the Energy Information Administration, due on Wednesday, confirm the industry body's figures, U.S. gasoline inventories would have declined for the third straight week to their lowest pre-Memorial Day levels since 2014.</p>
    <p>The Memorial day holiday, this year on May 29, traditionally marks the beginning of U.S. peak summer travel. U.S. gasoline futures rose 2% on Tuesday after the API data.</p>
    <p>Production cuts by some OPEC+ members take effect this month. Fears of a supply squeeze mounted after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he would keep short sellers - those betting that prices will fall - "ouching" and told them to "watch out".</p>
    <p>The comments could mean the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia will consider further output cuts at a meeting on June 4, said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam.</p>
    <p>Erlam added Brent crude prices need to rise above $77.50 a barrel to signal a sentiment shift.</p>
    <p>"Of course, actions speak louder than words and traders haven't been overly deterred by his words, despite the group having announced two sizeable cuts in the last year that briefly shook the markets," Erlam said.</p>
    <p>Some felt oil's upside was limited by U.S. debt ceiling jitters. Another round of debt ceiling talks ended on Tuesday with no signs of progress as the deadline to raise the government's $31.4 trillion borrowing limit or risk default ticked closer.</p>
    <p>"(Oil) prices are likely to remain within their broad year to date trading range as the economy continues to slow while the refill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and OPEC manages prices relative to global demand needs," said Rob Haworth,, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p>

	    <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices were steady on Wednesday after a surprise rise in U.S. crude inventories stoked demand concerns as economic worries competed with a tighter supply outlook for later in the year.</p>
	    <p>Brent crude futures rose 2 cents, or 0.7%, to $74.42 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude was down 5 cents to $70.81 at 0921 GMT.</p>	
    	<p>The International Energy Agency on Tuesday predicted demand would outpace supply by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second half of the year, with China making up 60% of oil demand growth in 2023.</p>	
    	<p>"Crude prices remain heavy as energy traders just can't shake off global demand concerns. It doesn't matter how upbeat everyone is for China's second half of the year, the current situation is too disappointing," said Edward Moya, an analyst at OANDA.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude stockpiles rose by about 3.6 million barrels in the week ended May 12, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures. Seven analysts polled by Reuters, had expected a 900,000 barrel drawdown.</p>
      <p>U.S. government data on crude and product stockpiles is due at 1430 GMT. [EIA/S]</p>
      <p>The crude inventory build added to concerns about U.S. growth after data showed retail sales rose 0.4% in April, short of estimates for an increase of 0.8%.</p>
      <p>Talks on raising the U.S. debt ceiling continue to weigh on the market. The U.S. Treasury Department has estimated that the United States will go into a crippling default as early as June 1 if Congress does not lift the ceiling.</p>
      <p>In China, April industrial output and retail sales growth undershot forecasts, suggesting the economy lost momentum at the beginning of the second quarter.</p>
      <p>"Markets were in a wait-and-watch mode over the outcome of crucial negotiations to raise the U.S. government's debt ceiling," said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.</p>
      <p>"A bunch of Chinese macro-economic data for April released on Tuesday confirmed the narrative of a patchy and slow recovery in the country and continue to weigh on oil market sentiment."</p>

    	<p>The imbalance between oil supply and demand is likely to reverse going into the summer, says one analyst.</p>
    	<p>"Currently, the global oil market is probably slightly oversupplied. It's going to flip to being undersupplied sometime in the late second quarter or early third quarter," Tortoise portfolio manager Rob Thummel told Yahoo Finance Live.</p>	
    	<p>"When the oil market is undersupplied, typically you see a positive price response. So we would expect oil prices to rise a bit," said Thummel.</p>	
	    <p>Crude prices have been under pressure recently, despite a production cut announced by OPEC+ last month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) initially surged on the news but have since lost those gains.</p>
      <p>WTI closed at $70.04 per barrel on Friday. Brent futures settled at $74.17.</p>
      <p>Oil analysts anticipate a rise in demand as China's economy reopens following strict Covid lockdowns last year.</p>
      <p>"The whole world is waiting on when does the Chinese economy reopen. And it's gradually reopening," said Thummel. "We expect the demand for oil globally in China to grow and accelerate throughout the rest of this year."</p>
      <p>Thummel expects gas and oil related stock prices to rise in tandem with crude. Year-to-date, they the S&P Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down 10%, underperforming the broader markets.</p>
      <p>"We think at Tortoise it's an attractive time to be looking at the energy sector because prices are probably low. They're probably going higher. And that will just result in an uplift of all energy stocks," said Thummel.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Europe has come a long way from the frenzied stockpiling driving up natural gas prices a year ago. As of May 9, Europe’s gas storage was full to 62%, and at the current pace of refilling, storage is expected to hit its capacity of about 1,138 terawatt-hours (TWh) by late August, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley. And it is driving down gas prices.</p>
    	<p>In August 2022, Dutch TFF gas futures, the benchmark European contract, hit €243.72 ($265.94) per megawatt-hour (MWh), buttressed by the energy disruptions of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the prospect of a punishing winter without enough heating fuel. By November, a few dozen LNG tankers were idling off the coast of Spain, waiting for another rise in prices before selling their cargo.</p>	
    	<p>But a harsh winter didn’t materialize, demand stayed low, and Europe ended the winter with record-high natural gas stocks for March, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe.</p>	
    	<p>Prices dropped through January and into spring, hitting €34.78 ($37.95) by May 12, a 150% drop from August 2022.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t ensure European consumers will get a break from high energy bills in the coming months. Since very little gas is being piped in from Russia (pdf), several factors could cause a swing in prices. A cold winter, heightened competition for LNG from Asia, or increased use of gas by Europeans, could strain even fully-stocked gas reserves, potentially pushing prices back up.</p>
      <p>In a paper published on Monday (May 8), Goldman Sachs estimated that average prices for the coming winter to be above €90 ($97.7)/MWh, and over €100 for a particularly harsh winter.</p>

    	<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled more than 1% lower on Friday, falling for the third consecutive week, as the market balanced supply fears against renewed economic concerns in the United States and China.</p>
    	<p>Brent crude futures settled down 81 cents, or 1.1%, to $74.17 while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude futures fell 83 cents, or 1.2%, to $70.04.</p>	
    	<p>Both benchmarks settled about 1.5% lower week on week.</p>	
    	<p>The U.S. dollar clung to modest gains against the euro on Friday and was headed for its biggest weekly gain since February, as uncertainty around the U.S. debt ceiling and monetary policy prompted a shift to safe havens. [=EUR]</p>
      <p>A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.</p>
      <p>"Lack of confidence in the economy is translating to a retreat to the safer dollar, and is also causing pessimism about oil demand," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.</p>
      <p>Concern mounted that the United States - the world's biggest oil consumer - will enter recession, with talks over the U.S. government's debt ceiling postponed and concern growing over another crisis-hit regional bank.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve will probably need to raise interest rates further if inflation stays high, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Friday, adding that data this month has not convinced her that price pressures are receding.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China's April consumer price data rose at a slower pace than in March, missing expectations, while deepening factory gate deflation refocused doubts about its recovery from COVID restrictions driving oil demand growth.</p>
      <p>The U.S. oil and natural gas rig count fell this week to its lowest in nearly a year, as gas rigs slumped by the most in a week since February 2016, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report on Friday.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil rigs fell by two to 586 this week, their lowest since June 2022, while gas rigs plunged by 16 to 141, their lowest April last year.</p>
      <p>The market drew some support from the forecast emerging supply deficit for the second half of the year, even as Iraq's oil minister Hayan Abdel-Ghani told Reuters on Friday he does not expect OPEC+ to decide on further production cuts when it next meets in Vienna on June 4.</p>
      <p>An OPEC report on Thursday said the producer group expects July-December demand for its own crude to be 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) higher than previously projected.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) kept its global oil demand forecast for 2023 unchanged on Thursday, expecting economic risks to be offset by higher Chinese demand growth.</p>
      <p>The market also drew support after U.S. energy secretary Jennifer Granholm signalled that the country could repurchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after completing a congressionally mandated sale next month.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil futures advanced on stronger-than-expected jobs data in the US and disruption to oil production in Alberta because of wildfires.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 3% on Monday, adding to a 4% gain on Friday when futures pared a steep weekly loss. Better-than-expected US employment data on Friday eased recession fears and raised expectations for oil demand in the world’s biggest consuming nation.</p>	
    	<p>On the supply side, several oil producers in the Canadian province of Alberta have shut down production because of wildfires. At least 145,000 barrels per day of oil production have been halted.</p>	
      <p>The gains have pared back some of the losses of the previous three weeks when fears of a US recession and bank failures rattled markets, pushing crude to the lowest intraday level since late 2021.</p>
      <p>Physical demand signals suggest at least some of the weakness in prices may have been overdone. The amount of crude held around the world on stationary tankers dropped to the lowest since mid-February, Vortexa data show.</p>
      <p>“The crude oil market remains exposed to high level of volatility, partly driven by extreme and regular positioning changes as funds struggle to find the right direction,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S.</p>
      <p>Brent crude has dropped by about 10% this year as the Federal Reserve’s most aggressive tightening campaign in a generation spurred concerns of a US slowdown or recession. The decline has come despite a surprise production cut by OPEC and its allies including Russia. Still, there’s little evidence that Moscow has so far reduced its supply despite a vow to do so.</p>
      <p>There are now risks of a further “OPEC supply response, or at least jawboning from the group, in an attempt to backstop or shore up prices,” said Vishnu Varathan, Asia head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd.</p>
      <p>Speculators sharply ramped up bets against oil markets last week, data showed. Money managers posted the largest increase on record in short positions on Europe’s diesel market, while also lifting them by the most since last March on Brent. US crude and diesel markets also saw increases just weeks after the OPEC+ cut designed to stem bearishness.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. laid the blame for oil’s drop over the past three weeks on a “mostly macro-financial selloff,” according to a note from analysts including Daan Struyven. The bank expects the global market to swing to “large deficits” in the second half, supporting its case for higher prices.</p>
      <p>The prompt spread for global benchmark Brent — the gap between its two nearest contracts — was 25 cents a barrel in backwardation. The figure has been fluctuating recently, swinging between 37 cents and 15 cents a barrel in backwardation over the previous week.</p>
    	<p>Traders will get a brace of outlooks this week on how the second half of the year may shape up. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries issues its monthly snapshot on Thursday and, ahead of that, the US Energy Information Administration delivers its short-term outlook on Tuesday. The world’s largest oil producer, Saudi Aramco, will also disclose earnings.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Warren Buffett doused cold water on the speculation that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.36%) (BRK.B 1.18%) had set its sights on its next elephant. At Berkshire's annual meeting, he emphatically told investors that the conglomerate wouldn't be buying the rest of oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.49%) that it doesn't currently own. His company had amassed a 23.5% stake in the oil producer and had received regulatory approval to boost it to as much as 50%. </p>
    	<p>Those comments might have investors who followed Buffett into the oil stock wondering if it's time to sell. Here's a look at what Buffett said about Occidental and the thesis for owning the oil producer now that a buyout is seemingly off the table.</p>	
    	<h3>Drilling down into Buffett's comments about Occidental Petroleum</h3>
      <p>Berkshire has been buying shares of the oil company hand-over-fist in the past year. Occidental has grown into the seventh-largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Shares are worth nearly $13 billion and are 3.8% of the portfolio's total value.</p>	
      <p>With Buffett's company holding over a quarter of Occidental's outstanding shares and getting regulatory approval to purchase up to half the company, many investors speculated that Berkshire would eventually acquire Occidental Petroleum. The investment seemed to mirror Berkshire's path to acquiring BNSF. Berkshire built up a 22.6% stake in the railway before acquiring the entire company in a $26.4 billion deal in 2010.</p>
    	<p>Buffett addressed the idea Berkshire would buy Occidental at its recent annual meeting. He told investors, "There's speculation about us buying control; we're not going to buy control." Buffett then quipped, "We wouldn't know what to do with it." Berkshire's CEO also said that while "we will not be making any offer for control of Occidental," his company "love[s] the shares we have." He further stated: "We may or may not own more in the future but we certainly have warrants on what we got on the original deal on a very substantial amount of stock around $59 a share, and warrants last a long time, and I'm glad we have them."</p>
      <p>Berkshire got those warrants when it made a $10 billion preferred stock investment in Occidental in 2019. That deal helped fund its purchase of Anadarko Petroleum. The warrants enable Berkshire to buy up to $5 billion of Occidental's stock at around $59 a share (which happens to be right around the recent price). Occidental Petroleum recently started buying back those preferred shares (which yield 8%).</p>
      <h3>With a buyout off the table, what's the Occidental Petroleum bull thesis?</h3>
      <p>Speculation that Buffett might buy Occidental had fueled a big rally in its stock last year. Shares of the oil company more than doubled in 2022, -- leading the S&P 500 -- driven by Buffett's purchases and higher oil prices. They've lost some steam in recent months as oil prices cooled off. Meanwhile, with Buffett ending the acquisition speculation, shares could lose more ground as investors who hoped he'd offer a premium to acquire the entire company bail on their position.</p>
      <p>However, an acquisition by Buffett never seemed to be the driving factor behind the purchases. His company has also been gobbling up shares of Chevron (CVX 0.64%). Berkshire owns 7% of the oil giant's outstanding shares, which are currently worth over $21 billion. That makes Chevron Berkshire's 5th largest holding.</p>
      <p>With sizable positions in two oil stocks, it seemed more like Buffett and his team were making a bold bet on higher oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While that thesis hasn't held up as well as expected due to concerns about a slowing global economy, Buffett has ample reasons to remain bullish on oil prices.</p>
      <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects resurgent jet fuel and Chinese oil demand to drive record oil demand this year. Meanwhile, supplies will remain tight, especially after OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut last month. That could cause a wide gap between supply and demand later this year, potentially driving up oil prices.</p>
      <p>In addition to its upside to oil prices, Occidental is an emerging leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. That could be an enormous business for the company. It sees CCS growing to a $3 trillion-$5 trillion global industry. Occidental believes it could one day make as much money from CCS as it currently produces from its oil and gas business.</p>
      <h3>Buffett's bull thesis remains intact</h3>
      <p>Investors who bought Occidental Petroleum hoping for a Buffett buyout were likely disappointed to learn that won't happen. While they might opt to sell, the reasons Buffett has been buying shares of the oil giant remain. Several catalysts could send oil prices higher. In addition, the company has lots of upside to the emerging carbon capture and storage sector. Continuing to hold the shares could pay big dividends over the longer term.</p>

    	<p>It's been brutal week for oil prices, despite a Friday rebound. Slides in earlier sessions led crude futures to close out their third straight week of losses.</p>
    	<p>The S&P 500 Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE) also rebounded during Friday's trading day, yet it ended the week down 5.7%.</p>	
    	<p>Recession fears drove much of the the downward movement in prior sessions. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points. The move is expected to further press the brakes on the economy.</p>	
    	<p>This week's slide played out in tandem with the regional banking turmoil. As regional banks came under pressure, oil prices tanked.</p>
      <p>"If we get a debacle in the financial markets, it will definitely have collateral damage in oil," OPIS global head of energy analysis Tom Kloza recently told Yahoo Finance Live.</p>
      <p>"Energy price movements are consistent with rising market expectations for a recession," Will Compernolle, FHN Macro Strategist wrote in a note to investors this week.</p>
      <p>The EIA’s recently released Weekly petroleum Status Report showed declining demand for gasoline and jet fuel in the week ending April 28th.</p>
      <p>While China reopening is expected to be a positive for oil, the demand hasn't been linear. China factory activity unexpectedly cooled in April, reducing demand expectations.</p>
      <p>"I think from a demand side perspective, the Chinese story from an industrial capacity perspective is still to play out throughout the year," Murray Auchincloss, chief financial officer of BP (BP), said during the energy giant's earnings call earlier this week.</p>
      <p>"It's why we are constructive on oil prices looking out through the rest of the year," he added.</p>
      <p>On Friday, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) rose 4.1% while Brent (BZ=F) crude gained 3.9%. WTI and Brent closed out the week with a decline of 7.1% and 5.3% respectively.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Crude markets have suffered a disastrous few weeks, dragged down by alarm over the wider economy. But real oil demand still looks strong enough to foster a rebound in prices.</p>
    	<p>International benchmark Brent almost dropped to $70 a barrel on Thursday after losing 17% since mid-April on fears of a US recession and signs of a disappointing recovery in China. Crude in New York plunged at the open to take the decline over the past three weeks to $20, before recovering.</p>	
    	<p>Nonetheless, there are signs the underlying oil market is resilient. China is sucking in a flood of cargoes as domestic travel rebounds, and traders expect the country’s crude purchases to remain high in the next few months. Inventories are tightening around the world, and should deplete even faster as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies implement new supply cutbacks.</p>	
      <p>That’s reassuring even some of the industry’s most bearish forecasters a supply deficit is coming which will trigger a recovery in prices.</p>
      <p>“The selloff was far greater than what market balances are showing — namely lower inventories with the prospect of inventory draws as the northern hemisphere’s summer unfolds,” said Ed Morse at Citigroup Inc. The bank has held one of the most cautious price outlooks on Wall Street this year.</p>
      <p>Crude’s retreat offers some respite for consumers after the inflationary shock inflicted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It also brings pain for bullish oil traders, and puts in peril the windfall being reaped by major oil companies and producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Iraq.</p>
      <p>Refinery Demand</p>
      <p>The pullback in crude markets began with fundamentals.</p>
      <p>Buying by refineries in Asia was subdued in April as margins for making fuels dipped. In a nod to some of that weakness, Saudi Arabia cut its oil prices for Asian processors for June on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, supplies from top exporter Russia have remained stubbornly high despite Moscow’s threats to slash output in retaliation for sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The market was faltering and Morgan Stanley — once at the forefront of calls for $100-a-barrel — on Tuesday abandoned projections for any substantial rally this year.</p>
      <p>The big drop-off came with worries over the economy and persistent trouble with banks that rippled through markets everywhere. Short-sellers have crept back into the market for the first time since the Saudi-led OPEC+ alliance unveiled new production curbs in early April.</p>
      <p>But oil consumption continues to appear healthy and may even rise further over the coming months, according to UBS Group AG, which advised clients in a note on Thursday to add long positions in Brent. The physical market, where actual oil is traded, remains strong and supply is “pretty tight,” Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Brent futures have started to retrace some of their losses, gaining as much as 1.9% on Friday to trade above $73 a barrel in London. The market’s strength is reflected across the pricing structure, with Brent futures for immediate delivery commanding a premium over later months in a curve known as backwardation.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anything has changed fundamentally,” said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Bank. Instead, these are “perfect conditions to be driven by top-down macro and momentum trading.”</p>
      <p>China Indicators</p>
      <p>While traders are still waiting to see how much crude Asia buys this month for further clues on demand, China is attracting cargoes as it emerges from its restrictive Covid rules. Flights in the country surged over the five-day Labor Day holidays with 9.42 million air passenger trips — an increase of 4.2% over the same period in 2019.</p>
      <p>World oil use too remains on track to climb by a healthy 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.</p>
    	<p>World oil use too remains on track to climb by a healthy 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.</p>
      <p>“For now, the oil market remains mired in a wall of recessionary worry,” Helima Croft, chief commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. But “OPEC remains fully committed to trying to midwife a recovery.”</p>
      <p>The latest slump in crude, coming just days into the output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been a warning light for the group and its partners. They will gather in person for their next monthly meeting for a detailed review of market trends.</p>
      <p>“The OPEC cuts should help mitigate” the bearish market backdrop, said Christyan Malek, head of energy strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “OPEC’s role as central bank for energy couldn’t come at a more critical time.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>A combination of negative economic data and thin trading in oil markets led to a sharp drop in crude prices Tuesday.</p>
    	<h3>What happened</h3>
      <p>Shares of oil and natural gas majors Chevron (CVX -4.30%), ExxonMobil (XOM -3.98%), and Petrobras (PBR -3.71%) were falling Tuesday, dropping significantly before recovering somewhat to declines of 4.6%, 3.8%, and 3.4%, respectively, as of 2:30 p.m. ET.</p>	
    	<p>Oil and natural gas businesses are quite sensitive to economic data, and several reports released Tuesday and earlier this week pointed to the likelihood of a global economic slowdown. In addition, the ongoing turmoil in U.S. regional banks threatens to slow lending and economic activity. Finally, holidays in Asia and the United Kingdom on Tuesday resulted in thinner-than-usual trading, which may have exacerbated the downward moves in crude prices.</p>	
    	<h3>So what</h3>
      <p>On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department's March Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) came in weaker than expected, following on the heels of a manufacturing data report Monday that was similarly below expectations.</p>
      <p>Job openings came in at 9.59 million in March, down from 9.97 million in February and below the consensus estimate of 9.64 million. The number of layoffs and discharges also grew more than expected to a figure equal to 1.2% of the labor force, up from 1% in February. Of note, there were still about 1.6 job openings for every unemployed person. That's a tight labor market, but not as tight as in February, when there were 1.9 openings per unemployed person. And for much of 2021 and 2022, there were around 2 openings per unemployed person.</p>
      <p>Also, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. orders for manufactured goods rose 0.9% month-over-month in March after two straight months of declines, but that was lower than the 1.1% gain expected. In addition, the February manufacturing result was revised down from a 0.8% decline to a 1.1% decline.</p>
      <p>Weak economic data are running up against another event that could tighten financial conditions even further. The Federal Open Market Committee started its two-day meeting Tuesday, and it's expected that it will raise the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points Wednesday, although that's not a certainty. Last week, rate futures suggested about a 90% chance of another 25-basis-point hike.</p>
      <p>The potential for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates into a weakening economic picture caused oil prices to plunge Tuesday. That followed a decline on Monday, when Chinese manufacturing data came in weaker than expected. Meanwhile, Iran announced it had actually grown its production to over 3 million barrels per day, which added incremental supply in a market dominated by demand fears.</p>
      <p>Finally, exacerbating the decline in oil prices Tuesday was a lack of trading activity in the U.K. and Asia due to holidays. Thin volume and a lack of liquidity can enhance price moves in either direction.</p>
      <p>Basically, the messy macroeconomic picture pushed oil prices down by about 5% to their lowest levels since December. In that light, it's no surprise that even diversified majors fell too. Smaller oil and natural gas companies slid even more.</p>
      <h3>Now what</h3>
      <p>Both ExxonMobil and Chevron recently reported first-quarter numbers that beat analysts' consensus estimates, but as huge global oil and gas companies, they can't really escape the macroeconomic situation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Petrobras has been performing well, but it has been under pressure for other reasons. The partially state-owned oil company just elected a new board of directors that will likely pivot it toward a more liberal policy stance favored by Brazil's new president, Lula da Silva, who backs price controls, environmental preservation, and investments in renewable energy. On Monday, a Brazilian environmental agency recommended against approving Petrobras' plans to drill near the mouth of the Amazon River. Perhaps because Petrobras' stock price had already declined significantly since Brazil's presidential election in the fall, it didn't fall by as much Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Oil and natural gas companies would no doubt come under pressure in a recession, but they do trade at low multiples today. Investors who hold these stocks not only benefit from their dividends, but also can profit during supply shocks like those that occurred last year. However, it appears as though demand worries are the problem of the day now, and likely will be in the months ahead.</p>

      <p>By Alex Lawler</p>
    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil fell on Monday as concern over the economic impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve potentially raising interest rates and weaker Chinese manufacturing data outweighed support from OPEC+ supply cuts taking effect this month.</p>
    	<p>The Fed, which meets on May 2-3, is expected to increase interest rates by another 25 basis points. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Monday, making oil more expensive for other currency holders.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude fell 97 cents, or 1.2%, to $79.36 a barrel by 1342 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slid $1.44, or 1.9%, to trade at $75.34.</p>	
    	<p>"The failure to reach more solid ground above $80.50 in Brent points to continued selling interest amid the well known growth/demand concerns," said Ole Hansen, head of commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank.</p>
      <p>Banking fears have weighed on oil in recent weeks and in what is the third major U.S. institution to fail in two months, United States regulators said on Monday First Republic Bank has been seized and a deal agreed to sell the bank to JPMorgan.</p>
      <p>"Investors are afraid that if the Fed continues to raise interest rates as expected, what will happen to the U.S. financial system's other problem children?," said Naeem Aslam of Zaye Capital Markets, who added a hike of at least 25 basis points this week was still expected.</p>
      <p>Weak economic data from China was also in focus. China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) declined to 49.2 from 51.9 in March, slipping below the 50-point mark that separates expansion and contraction in activity on a monthly basis.</p>
      <p>Some support came from voluntary output cuts of around 1.16 million barrels per day by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, which take effect from May.</p>
      <p>"We believe the oil market will be in deficit through the remainder of the second quarter" following the OPEC+ cuts, said Baden Moore, head of commodity and carbon strategy at National Australia Bank.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil recouped some of last week’s slump in lower-volume trading as many investors took a pause while awaiting further clues to demand.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate rose to trade near $79 a barrel, swinging in a $2.50 range during a volatile session throughout the day. Last week, the commodity experienced the biggest weekly drop since the banking crisis in March amid signs of shrinking refining margins in Asia.</p>	
        <p>“There are a lot of traders sitting on the sidelines trying to figure out a direction,” said Carley Garner a Commodity Broker and Strategist at DeCarley Trading. “Traders are looking for a dip to get into; if we hold $75, we can start making a way higher.”</p>	
        <p>Crude has wiped out nearly all of the rally seen earlier this month after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced surprise new production cuts. Citigroup Inc. said it was taken aback by the magnitude of the pullback in Asian refining margins, which is partly attributable to the ramp up of new Middle Eastern refineries.</p>
        <p>Later this week, the Federal Reserve will release the last of its major reports on US jobs, inflation and consumer spending before its May policy meeting. Additionally, some of the world’s biggest oil majors, including Chevron and Exxon, will report their first-quarter earnings on Friday.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The tide appears to have turned, just as it did at the crucial moment in 2008. And just like it was the case back then, it seems that most people missed it.</p>
        <p>The thing is that people are usually concerned with very short-term news and price moves:</p>	
        <p>- Gold rallied by $X, yesterday!</p>	
        <p>- Rates were just hiked by x%!</p>
        <p>And so on…</p>
        <p>In reality, these events are just triggers for events that are unfolding in tune with long-term trends and analogies. Some of those triggers make perfect sense, and some don’t, as markets can act in the “buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact” mode, thus greatly perplexing those, who expect the market moves to always be in tune with the news that was just announced.</p>
        <p>Boy, were those folks surprised when the rates were cut by 0.75% back in 2008 and the stock market still plunged!</p>
        <p>There are myriads of such examples, and examining them leads to one major take-away. Even though it might seem exciting and very important to focus on those immediate-term events, it is actually the analysis of trends, technicals, and analogies to the previous situations that actually brings useful insights that can then help one make profitable trades. Of course, no technique is perfect, and nobody, including yours truly, can guarantee any kind of performance, but based on two decades of my experience in the precious metals market, I see how useful this is, especially compared to any attempts to guess what the next “unexpected news” is going to be (hint: even if it happens as one had thought, it sometimes has a different effect than one had expected).</p>
        <p>When forecasting gold prices, it’s no different. Focusing on the big picture comes first, and spotting analogies to what already happened is second. Trying to guesstimate what’s about to take place in the news is much further on the list.</p>
        <p>The space here is limited (and so is everyone’s time), so to make a long story short, the big picture for gold is not as bullish as it might seem based on its most recent move above $2,000. No. Gold is barely above its 2011 high in nominal terms (not to mention real terms), despite loads of dollars being printed in the meantime and even despite the war outbreak in Europe.</p>
        <p>Silver and mining stocks are much below their 2011 highs – in fact, mining stocks are even well above their 2008 highs in many cases.</p>
        <p>This doesn’t show the strength of the market, but rather its weakness.</p>
        <p>As far as analogies to the previous cases, gold, silver, and mining stocks appear to be repeating their performances from previous periods, and the most important of the analogies seems to be the one to what happened in 2008.</p>
        <p>The reason is that it’s not only visible from the technical point of view, and it’s not only visible across many markets, but actually some of the fundamental news surrounding the price moves are similar.</p>
        <p>Starting with the latter, the rates are moving up, and that was also what preceded the 2008 slide (not directly, but still). And do you remember the Lehman collapse that one of the first dominos to fall? This time, it was the Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, in the aftermath of all this both: gold and silver prices plunged profoundly, but there was a huge counter-trend rally first.</p>
        <p>And what did gold do back then? It soared for about a week, then it traded sideways and finally topped slightly higher than it did initially.</p>
        <p>While gold soared, the USD Index declined on a short-term basis, the mining stocks moved higher, but overall followed the general stock market, and… There was a sharp upswing in crude oil prices (as seen on the bottom of the above chart), even though it’s been in a medium-term downtrend.</p>
        <p><strong>It all happened recently, too. Even the sharp upswing in crude oil!</strong></p>
        <p>The price of black gold just jumped, while being in a medium-term downtrend.</p>
        <p>Stock prices are currently moving sideways on a medium-term basis, but their most recent move was to the upside.</p>
        <p>It currently looks like the right shoulder of the head-and-shoulders formation is being formed. The RSI reading shows similarity to what happened in mid-2022 and back then a massive decline followed. Of course, not two periods are identical, but they are similar enough for the implications to be bearish at this time.</p>
        <p>This is especially the case that the volume has been visibly decreasing during the current upswing – exactly like it’s been the case in mid-2022.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the current short-term forecast for stock prices is bearish.</p>
        <p>This means that the implications for mining stocks are bearish as well, since those two markets (mining stocks are stocks, after all!) are connected – and this is the case just like it was back in 2008.</p>
        <p>The USD Index appears to have just finished its short-term decline that’s a correction within a bigger uptrend.</p>
        <p>Again, that’s something that we’ve seen in 2008. Back then, the move lower in the USD Index took less time, but let’s keep in mind that the history tends to rhyme rather than repeat itself to the letter.</p>
        <p>There’s a specific pattern present on the USD Index that affects quite many forex forecasts (not surprising given the USD Index is ultimately a weighted average of forex pairs).</p>
        <p>Namely, the U.S. currency tends to reverse its directions close to the turn of the month. That’s what I marked with dashed lines on the above chart. It seems that this technique worked once again, and a local bottom was formed.</p>
        <p>Zooming in allows us to see that the USD Index actually managed not only to break above its declining resistance line, but also verify this breakout and then rally once again.</p>
        <p>This – combined with above-mentioned monthly seasonal tendency – makes it very likely that the bottom in the USD Index is in.</p>
        <p>Given the negative correlation between gold and the USD Index, it seems that the top in gold is in as well.</p>
        <p>Let’s take a look at the gold price itself.</p>
        <p>After a sharp rally – that took place for about a week (just like in 2008!) – gold price started to move sideways and recently it moved to new intraday high.</p>
        <p>Unless one is aware of the bearish analogy to 2008, the above might seem bullish, but given the carnage that followed in 2008, gold price’s recent behavior is not bullish at all. It’s bearish.</p>
        <p>The fact that gold just moved back below $2,000 on an intraday basis only adds to the bearish implications of the recent price movement.</p>
        <p>What does it all mean?</p>
        <p>It means that despite a positive movement in gold in the last several weeks, gold price analysis actually suggests that a very bearish surprise awaits those, who are taking the price moves at their face value.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil lost ground amid signs of tepid demand, with a stronger dollar and key technical measures also putting a lid on the commodity’s recent rally.</p>
        <p>Some Asian refiners are considering cuts to crude-processing volumes as profit margins shrink, signaling softer oil demand in the region, while weakness in the global diesel market added to the concerns. The stronger dollar and lingering inflation also weighed on prices, with broader markets waiting to hear from Federal Reserve speakers this week.</p>	
        <p>“Worries about stuttering economic growth and untamable inflation are capping efforts to push prices higher,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. “Breaking above the $90 barrier on Brent will be a tall order in the very near future.”</p>	
        <p>Technicals are also providing headwinds for the commodity as the four-week rally has left crude in overbought territory, signaling a correction is possible in the short term. The US benchmark failed to break through its 200-day moving average last week and has been trading lower ever since.</p>
        <p>“Prices need a breath from the latest four-week rally,” said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial Securities. Futures are mostly in overbought territory, causing traders this week to be in a “cautious mode.”</p>
        <p>Oil has rebounded from the banking shock that rippled across markets in March and drove futures to a 15-month low. Shrinking crude stockpiles at the key US storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, and interruptions to supplies from Iraqi Kurdistan have added to the tightening of global markets.</p>

        <p>That's enough to absorb the shipments that no longer head to European nations, which used to account for nearly two-thirds of Russia's crude exports. Europe now takes in only 8% of Russia's oil exports, per Kpler.</p>
        <p>"Both China and Russia are taking advantage of discounted Russian crude, benefiting from the sanctions applied on Russian materials by other countries," Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, told Insider Friday.</p>
        <p>Behind China and India, Turkey and Bulgaria are the biggest buyers of Russian crude.</p>
        <p>Even before Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine, China was already a top buyer of Russian crude, importing 25% of its crude from the country in 2021. That's since climbed to 36%, Kpler data shows.</p>
        <p>India, the world's third-largest oil importer, relied on Russia for about 1% of its total volumes prior to the war, but now buys 51% of its oil from Russia.</p>
        <p>The US has led Europe and other Western nations in imposing sanctions and energy price caps on Russia, designed to maintain market flows while curtailing Moscow's export revenue.</p>
        <p>European Central Bank calculations show trade volume between the euro area and Russia has halved since February 2022, with the bloc's imports of Russian imports seeing particularly steep declines following the bans on coal in August 2022, crude oil in December 2022, and refined oil products in February 2023.</p>
        <p>The ECB chart below shows a similar pattern illustrated in Kpler's data, with Russian seaborne crude exports shifting toward Asian buyers and away from Europe.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the revenue Russia generates from its energy exports has fallen along with the drop in prices, even as volumes remain elevated.</p>
        <p>The International Energy Agency said Friday that Moscow's revenue is down about 43% compared to the same time last year.</p>
        <p>But oil prices are heading back up as China's reopening economy drives demand while OPEC and Russia pinch supplies.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut of over 1 million barrels a day, with Russia extending its 500,000-barrel-a-day pullback through mid-2023.</p>

          <li>Global oil demand is expected to hit a new record this year, spelling trouble for crude prices.</li>
          <li>The IEA estimated oil demand could hit 101.9 million barrels per day in 2023.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Global oil demand is expected to notch a new record this year – and that could spell trouble for crude prices, which are already facing upwards pressure from supply cuts, the International Agency said in a recent report.</p>
        <p>The energy watchdog predicted the world's crude oil demand would jump to a record 101.9 million barrels a day in 2023, up by 2 million barrels a day from last year.</p>	
        <p>Developing economies could account for 87% of the expected demand growth this year, the IEA said, while China alone could account for at least half as its economy continues to reopen.</p>	
        <p>Meanwhile, the global supply of oil is still under stress. OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut earlier this month of over 1 million barrels a day. Russia, which is a member of OPEC+, said it would extend its cut of 500,000 barrels a day cut through mid-2023.</p>
        <p>"Our oil market balances were already set to tighten in the second half of 2023, with the potential for a substantial supply deficit to emerge. The latest cuts risk exacerbating those strains, pushing both crude and product prices higher. Consumers currently under siege from inflation will suffer even more from higher prices, especially in emerging and developing economies," the IEA said.</p>
        <p>Oil prices briefly spiked into the triple-digits last year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine created chaos in markets. Prices have since eased, but the new cuts from OPEC+ would likely more than counteract any non-OPEC+ production increases this year, the IEA said.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate crude is up 2.4% year to date, and Brent crude, the international benchmark, is up 1.6%.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Gold has been shining in recent months, buoyed by safe-haven demand amid recession fears and the banking turmoil. The Fed rate hike pause bets, lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar also added to the strength.</p>
        <p>The most actively traded gold-futures contract rose to $2,055.30 an ounce, up about 13% year-to-date. That has put the bullion within striking distance of its record high reached in the summer of 2020. After logging the best monthly performance since July 2020, gold is on track for the second consecutive gain in April (read: Gold Shines in March: 5 ETFs That Gained the Most).</p>	
        <p>With the rise in prices, almost all gold ETFs hit a new 52-week high in the last trading session. We have highlighted the most popular ones that are flying high. These include SPDR Gold Trust ETF GLD, iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF SGOL and iShares Gold Trust Micro IAUM. Each of these funds gained 10.4% from a year-to-date look.</p>	
        <h3>Behind the Rise in Gold Price</h3>
        <p>The latest batch of economic data points to a slowdown in the economy, prompting bets that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate-hike cycle. The yellow metal is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding bullion. A pause or slowdown in the pace of rate hikes will lift gold price higher. The CME FedWatch tool shows markets are pricing in a 66.8% chance of a 25 basis-point hike in May, with rate cuts seen in the back half of the year.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the recent collapse of several U.S. banks led to worries about financial instability across the globe, thus raising the appeal for the yellow metal as a safe haven and a store of value. Growing recession fears and intensifying geopolitical tensions compelled investors to flock to gold. The International Monetary Fund warned that the risk of a recession has grown for advanced economies in the wake of bank failures in the United States and Europe and slashed its outlook for global growth this year.</p>
        <p>Notably, gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle (read: 4 ETF Areas to Benefit as Geopolitical Concerns Intensifying).</p>
        <p>The dollar index slid to a one-year low, supporting the rally in the gold price as a weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers. Further, a boost in gold buying by central banks this year has added fuel to the rally.</p>
        <p>Here’s a detailed discussion on the five ETFs mentioned earlier:</p>
        <h3>SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD)</h3>
        <p>SPDR Gold Trust ETF tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U.S. dollars and kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA. It is an ultra-popular gold ETF, with AUM of $60 billion and a heavy volume of about 7.6 million shares a day.</p>
        <p>SPDR Gold Trust ETF charges 40 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 5 ETFs to Play as Inflation Cools Down to 5%).</p>
        <h3>iShares Gold Trust (IAU)</h3>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust offers exposure to the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion. It is backed by physical gold under the custody of JP Morgan Chase Bank in London.</p>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust charges 25 bps in annual fees. It is liquid and popular, trading in average daily volumes of 5 million shares and has AUM of $29 billion.</p>
        <h3>SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM)</h3>
        <p>SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust seeks to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion. It is a slightly modified alternative to the State Street behemoth gold fund SPDR Gold Trust ETF.</p>
        <p>SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust is the low-cost choice in the U.S. listed physically gold-backed ETF space, charging investors 10 bps in annual fees. It has $6.2 billion in AUM and trades in a solid average daily volume of 1.2 million shares.</p>
        <h3>Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF (SGOL)</h3>
        <p>Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF tracks the price of gold bullion. The Trust holds allocated physical gold bullion bars stored in secure vaults in Zurich, Switzerland and London, the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF has amassed $2.7 billion in its asset base and trades in a solid volume of 2.5 million shares per day. It charges 17 bps in annual fees per year.</p>
        <h3>iShares Gold Trust Micro (IAUM)</h3>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust Micro offers exposure to the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion. It is the lowest-cost gold ETF on the market, having an expense ratio of 0.09% (read: Can Gold ETFs Continue Their Winning Run?).</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose for the fourth straight week, supported by signs of a tightening global market that have the International Energy Agency warning of higher prices ahead.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate settled above $82 a barrel, posting its longest run of weekly advances since June. Crude is hovering near five-month highs after OPEC+ surprised the market with plans to cut more than 1 million barrels of daily output. Declining US stockpiles, weaker flows from Russia and interruptions to pipeline supplies from Iraqi Kurdistan have added to the gains.</p>	
        <p>Markets are digesting a week of mixed projections for crude supply and demand. The latest OPEC+ cuts threaten to boost oil prices for consumers already facing high inflation, the IEA said in its monthly outlook on Friday. The cartel had forecast a day earlier that markets would be deeply undersupplied. In contrast, the US Energy Information Administration projected supplies surpassing demand both in 2023 and 2024.</p>	
        <p>Demand from the world’s largest crude importer is supporting prices as well. Recent data show that China imported the most oil in three years last month, underpinned by record Russian flows. On Friday, People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said the nation’s economy is expected to grow about 5% this year.</p>
        <p>Key technical measures are signaling a tighter market, too. WTI’s prompt spread — the difference between its two nearest contracts — was at 9 cents a barrel in backwardation. The bullish pattern is a stark reversal from when it was trading 16 cents in contango a month ago.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Global oil markets will see a sizable supply deficit this year, as the production cutbacks of major exporters begin to kick in.</p>
        <p>The world will be short by about 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, more than reversing an expected surplus of 300,000 barrels a day in the second quarter, according to OPEC data cited by Bloomberg.</p>	
        <p>That's after OPEC and non-member partner Russia announced steep cuts to their production. On April 2, OPEC lowered its planned output by 1 million barrels a day, citing protection against price shocks after March's bank turmoil caused a brief drop in the oil prices.</p>	
        <p>Soon after the OPEC news, Russia also announced that it would extend its own cutback of 500,000 barrels a day through the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Actual reductions in oil output may not end up being as steep as the announced cuts to production quotas, given that some members of the coalition are already producing below target levels.</p>
        <p>Still, prospects for tighter oil supplies come as demand will continue to ramp up, putting more upward pressure on crude prices, which have jumped 20% over the last month.</p>
        <p>OPEC forecasts that oil consumption will climb by 2.3 million barrels a day this year to hit a new record 101.89 million a day.</p>

        <p>Vancouver, BC --News Direct-- MarketJar</p>
        <p>After experiencing its strongest run in a decade last year, gold market M&A activity is continuing to ramp up with $40 billion in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the sector so far in 2022.</p>
        <p>Newmont Corporation, the world's largest gold miner, recently launched a US$17 billion bid for rival Newcrest Mining last week, creating expectations of more consolidation to come. But Newmont’s latest bid is just one of many major deals hitting the space as producers look to replace depleting supplies at their current operations.</p>	
        <p>Agnico Eagle Mines and Pan American Silver Corp just completed the acquisition of Yamana Gold for $4.8 billion. BHP Limited is acquiring Australian gold and copper producer OZ Mining for $6.61 billion, while B2Gold Corp just signed a deal to acquire Sabina Gold & Silver for $800 million.</p>	
        <p>If bond yields fall and interest rates rise, the gold price is anticipated to rise as the dollar's purchasing power and consumer quality of living fall. What’s more, prolonged turmoil in global financial markets in 2023 will likely fare well for gold.</p>
        <p>Although gold M&A deals are taking place across the globe, there seems to be a focus on projects in Canada. In Q3 2022, alone there was a total of $562.8 million worth of M&A deals in Canada including Kinross Gold acquiring Great Bear Resources for $1.44 billion, and Agnico Eagle and Kirkland Lake Gold completed a $10 billion merger to become the third-largest gold producer in the world.</p>
        <p>The Canadian gold mining industry also gained significant attention last spring, when billionaire gold investor Eric Sprott made his largest investment to date into early-stage exploration company New Found Gold, which he believes could uncover “the greatest gold discovery in the history of Canada.”</p>
        <p>Another player in Canada’s gold exploration space is Fury Gold Mines (TSX:FURY) (NYSE-A:FURY), a well-funded gold exploration company located in two of Canada's most productive mining regions: Quebec's James Bay Region and Nunavut's Kitikmeot Region.</p>
        <p>The company’s portfolio includes its flagship Eau Claire project in Quebec's James Bay Region, its wholly-owned Lac Clarkie project next door, and the Éléonore South joint venture project with Newmont Gold, host to a large-scale high-grade untested gold-in-till anomaly with "a tremendous amount of exploration upside."</p>
        <p><strong>Canadian Gold Miner Is Strategically Positioned in Two Prolific Mining Regions</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fury Gold Mines Limited (TSX:FURY) (NYSE-A:FURY)</strong>has been focusing its efforts on its flagship Eau Claire project, which is located near James Bay. Earlier this year, a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for the project was completed, revealing an M&I Resource of 808,000 ounces (oz) of gold at 6.65 g/t Au and an additional Inferred Resource of 458,000 oz at 7.48 g/t Au.</p>
        <p>On April 13, Fury announced that it has commenced the 2023 drill program at Eau Claire, which will comprise 10,000-15,000 meters (m) focused on the Gap Zone, Western Hinge, and North Limb targets to build on the success of the 2021 and 2022 drill programs. The company will be focused on the Western Hinge target initially to continue to expand the Eau Claire high-grade gold deposit. Fury plans to commence drilling at the Percival Prospect later in Q2 2023.</p>
        <p><strong>Fury</strong>'s improved geological interpretation of the Eau Claire resource focused on the fold geometry at the Hinge Target, has resulted in an over 25% increase in the mineralized footprint. The mineralized system is still open in all directions, and intercepts of 5.75 g/t gold over 4m, 21.4 g/t gold over 1m, 5.86 g/t gold over 3.5m and 9.36 g/t gold over 3m have been returned. During 2023, the Hinge Target exploration plans will focus on expanding the mineralization footprint further to the west and updip.</p>
        <p><strong>Fury Gold Mines Limited (TSX:FURY) (NYSE-A:FURY)</strong>also recently provided an update on the Lac Clarkie project, which is located just east of Eau Claire. As a result of the conclusion of a B-horizon soil sampling study, the Company has defined eight gold anomalies. Six of the targets are located in the Cannard Deformation Zone, which contains numerous gold occurrences throughout its more than 100 km mapped length, including the Eau Claire Deposit and the Percival Prospect. Fury is attempting to prioritize these newly discovered targets for additional examination in 2023, with the objective of advancing a number of them to the drill-ready stage.</p>
        <p><strong>Fury</strong>is well-funded for planned exploration following a recent private placement for C$8.75 million in cash, C$16.2 million in treasury securities, and 59.5 million Dolly Varden Silver shares.</p>

        <p>By Shariq Khan</p>
        <p>BENGALURU (Reuters) -Oil prices fell a dollar a barrel on Thursday, as an OPEC report stoked summer demand worries and traders took profits after benchmarks scaled multi-month highs in the previous session.</p>	
        <p>Brent crude fell $1.24, or 1.4%, to settle at $86.09 a barrel, only the second time this month that the global benchmark has finished lower. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slipped $1.10, or 1.3%, to close at $82.16 a barrel.</p>	
        <p>Both benchmarks had gained 2% on Wednesday to their highest in more than a month, as cooling U.S. inflation spurred hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will stop raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) flagged downside risks to summer oil demand in a monthly report on Thursday, highlighting rising inventories and challenges to global growth.</p>
        <p>The report shed light on the reasons behind a surprise production cut announced by OPEC+, which includes Russia and other OPEC allies, at the start of this month</p>
        <p>"Generally I would say we saw builds in oil inventories this week in those countries which publish stocks data, so maybe that is what has been a realization that the market hasn't shifted into a deficit," UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.</p>
        <p>Despite Thursday's declines, the OPEC+ decision has pushed Brent futures up nearly 8% so far this month, and it continues to raise expectations of potential future tightness in the oil markets.</p>
        <p>Oil price declines were also limited as OPEC kept its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2023 unchanged. Other economic indicators lent further support.</p>
        <p>The U.S. dollar index fell to a two-month low on Thursday after producer prices unexpectedly declined in March, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve is near the end of its interest rate hiking cycle.</p>
        <p>A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated oil cheaper for investors holding other currencies, lifting demand.</p>
        <p>"With the dollar at its weakest in a year versus the euro, that formula kicks in with an exclamation mark," said Mizuho analyst Robert Yawger.</p>
        <p>Signs of a demand recovery in China, the top importer of crude oil and products, provided more support for oil prices, Yawger said.</p>
        <p>China's crude oil imports in March surged 22.5% from a year earlier to the highest since June 2020, data showed on Thursday.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- One oil exchange-traded fund saw its largest one-day outflow in more than three years, a possible sign that some investors remain concerned about the outlook after OPEC+ delivered an unexpected supply cut.</p>

Another fund, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF — ticker UCO — saw outflows of $158.5 million last week. That’s its biggest weekly drop since March 2022.</p>
        <p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced a surprise output cut earlier this month, led by Saudi Arabia. While that helped prices to surge last week, concerns about a potential slowdown in demand have lingered. There’s speculation both that the US could tip into recession, hurting consumption, and OPEC+ actions telegraph its concerns about market weakness.</p>
        <p>“There is still a large segment of the market concerned over the demand outlook and OPEC+ cuts would have likely only reinforced these concerns,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV in Singapore.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- OPEC+’s surprise oil-production cut sent shock waves through financial markets and pushed crude prices up by the most in a year. Now that the dust has started to settle, one question looms large: Will that price rally stick, or fade away?</p>
        <p>Banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to RBC Capital Markets LLC raised their oil-price forecasts immediately after the OPEC+ cut. Yet, many traders still believe a souring economic outlook will block the group’s actions from pushing prices higher. Demand indicators are also starting to flash warning signs.</p>
        <p>It could end up being the ultimate test of what matters more to the market: tighter supplies, or the lackluster demand picture. That will likely bring more uncertainty over the direction of prices — a complicated development for the Federal Reserve and the world’s central bankers in their ongoing battle against inflation.</p>
        <p>“It’s a very hard market to trade right now,” said Livia Gallarati, a senior analyst at Energy Aspects. “If you’re a trader, you are pulled between what’s happening at a macroeconomic level and what’s happening fundamentally. It’s two different directions.”</p>
        <p>One thing that is certain: A major shift of market control into the hands of Saudi Arabia and its allies has now been cemented, with huge implications for geopolitics and the world’s economy.</p>
        <p>Investors have continued to reward US drillers for production discipline, making it unlikely that shale companies will ever again undertake the kind of disruptive growth that helped to keep energy inflation tame last decade. That leaves the oil market under the purview of OPEC+ at a time when some experts have predicted that demand is heading to a record.</p>
        <p>“The surprise OPEC cuts have already triggered fears of a resurgence in inflation,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, a lead index trader at commodities brokerages Marex Group Plc. “These renewed inflation concerns should only increase” in the months ahead, he said.</p>
        <p>Here is an overview of what traders will be watching in the oil market.</p>
        <p>Summer Demand</p>
        <p>The timing of OPEC’s decision has struck an odd chord for many oil experts.</p>
        <p>The production cuts don’t take effect until May, and much of the repercussions are likely to be felt in the second half of the year. That’s a time when oil demand typically reaches its seasonal peak, partly thanks to the busy summer driving season in the US. It’s also the point when China’s economic reopening is expected to start swinging into full gear, further underpinning demand.</p>
        <p>Typically, OPEC would want to take advantage of that consumption burst by selling into the market as much as possible. Instead, the cut means the cartel is holding back. That’s sparking debate about whether the move will end up driving oil prices to $100 a barrel as demand surges, or whether, instead, the cartel and its allies are preparing for a recession-marked summer of tepid consumption.</p>
        <p>“While OPEC+ cuts on the surface are generally seen as bullish, it does also raise concerns over the demand outlook,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING. “If OPEC+ were confident in a strong demand outlook this year, would they really feel the need to cut supply?”</p>
        <p>Moves in global fuel markets underscore the demand skepticism. While oil prices rallied, moves for refined products were less pronounced, shrinking margins for refiners across Europe and the US. In Asia, prices of diesel, a key refinery product, are signaling heightened slowdown concerns as timespreads shrink to their lowest since November.</p>
        <p>Elevated Stockpiles</p>
        <p>While US inventories have been declining, global inventories are still high.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, commercial oil stockpiles held in OECD countries were sitting about 8% above last year’s levels, according to estimates from the US Energy Information Administration. That’s a fairly sizeable buffer and a sign of the weakness in consumption that’s plagued the market in the past few months.</p>
        <p>“You do need to chew through that overhang first before we can see we upside,” said Gallarati of Energy Aspects.</p>
        <p>Russian Flows</p>
        <p>Oil bulls have waited in vain for a Russian output cut promised for March to show up. The Kremlin said it would slash production by 500,000 barrels a day in March in retaliation for import bans and price caps imposed by “unfriendly countries.” But there’s been no sign of lower Russian output showing up in the one measure that matters to global crude markets — the number of barrels leaving the country.</p>
        <p>Crude shipments from Russia’s ports hit a new high in the final week of March, topping 4 million barrels a day. That’s 45% higher than the average seen in the eight weeks before Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine and has been boosted by the diversion since January of about 500,000 barrels a day delivered by pipeline directly to Poland and Germany.</p>
        <p>Shale’s Production Discipline</p>
        <p>It wasn’t long ago that there were two major players that oil traders turned to for direction over supplies: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the US shale industry.</p>
        <p>At the time, OPEC and shale were locked in a battle for market share. It was a feud that helped to keep global oil prices — and energy-driven inflation — at bay for the better part of decade.</p>
        <p>Then the pandemic hit, and with it an oil price rout that suffocated the shale industry. For the last three years, even as the market recovered and cash flow surged, companies have prioritized dividends and share buybacks over new drilling. It’s been a winning strategy. Since March 2020, the S&P 500 Energy Sector Index has surged almost 200%, outpacing the S&P 500’s nearly 60% gain.</p>
        <p>Now, as calls for peak shale output gather pace, OPEC has one less factor to consider when making supply decisions.</p>
        <p>That’s a sore spot for President Joe Biden, who was quick to downplay the impact of the decision by the cartel and its allies to cut output by more than 1 million barrels per day. Biden vowed after an initial production cut last year that there would be “consequences” for Saudi Arabia, but the administration has yet to follow through.</p>
        <p>Futures Curve</p>
        <p>Talk of $100 oil has been buzzing since the end of last year, but it seems like the can keeps getting kicked down the road. First, some analysts had predicted prices would reach that threshold in the second quarter of 2023. The view got pushed into the second half of the year, and now even some of the bigger bulls aren’t expecting the magic number to come into play until 2024.</p>
        <p>The oil futures curve is reflecting those expectations. Prices for contracts tied to deliveries as far out as December 2024 and 2025 have rallied, even as benchmark front-month futures are starting to ease.</p>
        <p>“The OPEC+ output cut certainly raises the possibility of $100 a barrel this year, although it is by no means a certainty,” said Harry Altham, an analyst at brokerage StoneX. “Demand-side weakness stemming from growth considerations is clearly taking a more prominent role.”</p>

        <p>The gold standard as it existed under the Bretton Woods system until 1971 is likely never coming back. There are a myriad of reasons for this but the most important lie with the US government’s ability to control the economy. Under the gold standard, the government no longer has the tools it uses to support the economy.</p>
        <p>This mostly includes the government’s control over the USD. Under a gold standard, those with the most gold naturally control the dollar. While a large portion of gold is mined in the U.S., a majority is produced by foreign powers. Moving back to the gold standard would effectively entail surrendering the dollar to the control of those with the most stockpiles of the metal.</p>
        <p>So the Bretton Woods gold standard isn’t tenable but is the current fiat system much less problematic? Many believe that the new system concentrates too much power in the Federal Reserve. For example, the Fed increased the M2 money supply (the amount of all dollars in circulation including deposits) by 27% in 2020-2021 under its aggressive Quantitative Easing (QE) program that aimed to prevent a recession. This was the largest increase in the country’s history, beating out even the second world war (18%) and the 2008 financial crisis (10%). To the surprise of (almost) no one, this heavily contributed to widespread, lasting inflation that is still affecting American citizens today.</p>
        <p>Economists still argue over whether the Fed’s actions were positive or negative on the whole but many agree that QE unfairly benefits monolithic corporations over small businesses and individuals. Many detractors of the buying spree hope that a gold standard could be a good way to bring the Fed into line.</p>
        <p>A full gold standard is probably impossible but (state) Senator Bryan Huges (R) and Representative Mark Dorazio (R) of Texas think they have found a way to bring back many of its benefits. They introduced matching bills to their respective houses that propose the introduction of a gold-backed digital currency.</p>
        <p>The bills state that “The [state] comptroller shall establish a digital currency that is backed by gold so that each unit of the digital currency issued represents a particular fraction of a troy ounce of gold held in trust.” They would also require that “The trustee shall maintain enough gold to provide for the redemption in gold of all units of the digital currency that have been issued and are not yet redeemed for money or gold” to prevent bank runs.</p>
        <p>The bills’ sponsors made sure to add that the funds received from purchasing the digital currency, the gold held under the trust, and any proceeds resulting from the sale of the redeemed gold are not available for legislative appropriation. This would prevent the state legislators from pillaging the trust and hopefully keeping the gold backing intact.</p>
        <p>This bill is fascinating in many different ways. It’s an interesting attempt to return to some semblance of the gold standard as well as one of the world’s first potential experiments in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
        <p>The bill also raises intriguing questions about the future of federalism in the U.S. For example, would the Treasury Department allow Texas to create its own digital currency? There doesn’t seem to be a clear answer yet but it seems to be outlawed in the constitution under Clause 1 of Section 10, depending on your interpretation. The clause states that “No State shall...coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts...”</p>
        <p>Texas isn’t the first state to attempt to create their own state currency. At least 13 other states considered it after the 2008 financial crisis. Legislators argued that the section of the clause that says “make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts” allows this, despite the fact that “no state shall...coin Money” appears in the same sentence.</p>
        <p>The Texas bills haven't been assigned to a committee yet (the next step of the legislative process after a bill is presented) so these questions may not be answered for a long time. Until then, investors will have to settle with physical gold and other precious metals to protect their portfolios. In the end, physical gold will likely still be the superior safe haven asset because you can store it yourself to avoid counterparty risk.</p>
        <p>Investors are turning to gold and silver in droves to protect their portfolios as uncertainty rises in the economy.

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The existential threat to Saudi Arabia and the OPEC cartel comes from China, not from net zero or from green deals in the West.</p>
        <p>Chinese sales of petrol and diesel cars fell 20pc in absolute volume terms in February from a year earlier. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles kept rising explosively and reached a record 32pc of the market for standard passenger cars.</p>
        <p>At the current pace, EV sales in China will hit eight million this year, helped by the proliferation of battery-swapping stations. Rather than charging your own car, you do an instant swap. No need to wait. No need for charge-points everywhere.</p>
        <p>Sales have surged despite the elimination of subsidies at the end of last year.  China’s best-selling EV is the BYD Song Plus, which retails for about £22,000. Number two is the smaller Wuling Mini. It starts at around £4,000 (not a misprint).</p>
        <p>“They are producing cheap EVs for the mass market, which is still completely lacking in the West. It is absolutely taking off,” said Lord Adair Turner, chairman of the global Energy Transitions Commission (ETC).</p>
        <p>The consensus forecast until recently was that EV penetration would reach 40pc of Chinese sales by 2030. That threshold could be crossed as soon as this year if manufacturers can produce fast enough to meet the demand. “We think EVs will reach 80pc of sales in China by 2030,” said Kingsmill Bond from energy strategists RMI.</p>
        <p>Electrification is spreading to light commercial vehicles, up 85pc year-on-year.  Over 60pc of buses in service in Chinese cities are already low-carbon. All municipal buses on the eastern seaboard will be electrified by 2025. Long-haul trucks are next in line.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that EVs worldwide have already displaced 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) of oil use, or 1.5pc of global demand. This is about to accelerate exponentially.</p>
        <p>“China’s demand for oil is suddenly going to start falling. Half of China's total car fleet could be electric by 2030. If you add up the numbers, that could subtract several million barrels of oil a day,” said Lord Turner.</p>
        <p>“China’s high speed rail network means that there won’t be so much internal aviation either. Oil use per capita is never going to be anything close to American levels,” he said.</p>
        <p>Opec maintains the fiction that oil demand will keep booming until the middle of the century, but this is based on the obsolete premise that Asia's rising middle class will more than compensate for declining imports in Europe and America.</p>
        <p>“Whatever they say in public, the Saudis know the game is up. They can see that the world’s largest car market for petrol cars is going to collapse,” said RMI’s Mr Bond.</p>
        <p>For the last 40 years the Saudis have acted (mostly) as ‘Federal Reserve’ of the global oil market, working closely with the US and Europe to maintain stability. They would restrain Opec hotheads from pushing prices too high at critical moments, knowing that this would backfire by accelerating the switch to rival technologies.</p>
        <p>It has abandoned this role as market regulator under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The strategy today is to extract as much money as possible from crude reserves before the window shuts forever, deliberately forcing prices higher (by cartel practices) to exploit captive demand for legacy transport.</p>
        <p>Last weekend’s Saudi-led decision by Opec and Russia to cut global supply by a further 1.1m b/d is an act of weakness. It is not the action of states seeking to preserve a sustainable business model.</p>
        <p>It was an affront to President Joe Biden but it was no favour for Xi Jinping either. Oil shocks are horrible for China. Its energy intensity per unit of GDP is two and a half times higher than in the US.</p>
        <p>America is largely self-sufficient in crude: China is the world’s largest importer by far at 10.8m b/d. Its oil-import dependency has risen to 70pc, a greater level of vulnerability than the US at the worst point of the Arab oil embargo in 1973.</p>
        <p>This oil is mostly shipped in tankers through the Straits of Molucca. China is also the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, which also comes on ships. This is a glaring geostrategic weakness as the superpower clash with the US turns increasingly dangerous.</p>
        <p>Chinese strategists can see how the West is using its stranglehold over global tanker fleets, vessel insurance, and shipping finance to asphyxiate Russia. They have also studied Franklin Roosevelt’s blockade of Japanese oil imports in 1941. They know that China cannot risk a showdown over Taiwan until it has a safer supply of energy.</p>
        <p>Hence the massive expansion of renewable power currently underway. Great tracts of desert in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang are being covered with solar panels and onshore turbines, bundled with extra coal capacity as a back-up to avoid winter blackouts.</p>
        <p>Xi Jinping’s original plan was to reach 1,200 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar by 2030. China’s Research Academy of Environmental Sciences says this target will be achieved five years early, given that the rollout is running at 180 GW a year.</p>
        <p>This compares to total installed capacity of 33 GW in France, 42 GW in the UK, and 240 GW in the US since the start of the green era.</p>
        <p>Nikhil Bhandari and Amber Cai from Goldman Sachs think China will smash the target three times over, reaching a staggering 3,300 GW by the end of this decade, all backed by a vast expansion of energy storage. They estimate that the county could halve its total energy imports by the early 2040s.</p>
        <p>This would require $2.2 trillion of investments but that should not be understood as a cost. Goldman says combined renewables with storage operating around the clock will be highly profitable by 2030 as they undercut coal, with a rate of return on capital reaching 10pc.</p>
        <p>They think China’s total CO2 emissions will peak as soon as 2028.</p>
        <p>China is not doing this as a favour to the West. It is doing so in order to confront the West from a position of greater strength in the future, and because it aims to become the world’s clean-tech hegemon.</p>
        <p>The Chinese have already cornered 90pc of global production of solar panels, and control 70pc of the lithium output – although that may matter less as sodium-ion batteries arrive.</p>
        <p>One can be too cynical about China’s motives. Xi Jinping was an environmental crusader 20 years ago as Zhejiang party chief.  He was a pioneer of the radical ‘Green GDP’ campaign in 2004, which called on local governments to subtract ecological damage from the raw GDP figures. He knows that China is more immediately vulnerable to climate change than the US or Europe.</p>
        <p>Chinese scientists say the Himalayan glaciers – the Third Pole – are melting even faster than previously thought. They will shrink by two-thirds over the course of this century under current warming trends, exposing China’s ancient river systems to the annual devastation of spring floods followed by summer droughts. So yes, China has to act.</p>
        <p>China’s green leap forward is a nightmare for Big Oil. It is compelling America and Europe to respond in kind, causing a step-change in the arms race for clean-tech ascendancy.</p>
        <p>The EU’s retreat from its 2035 ban on combustion engines makes no difference in this larger geo-economic context. The permitted e-fuels, made from green hydrogen, are too wasteful and expensive to have any commercial relevance. They retain just 16pc of the original energy input compared to 77pc for EVs.</p>
        <p>The next generation of solid state batteries and lithium-air variants will complete the annihilation in the late 2020s, opening the way to EVs with much longer driving ranges, much lower costs, and less reliance on scarce minerals.</p>
        <p>Technology married to market forces will render fossil-fuel bans in the EU, the UK, Japan, California, or Quebec superfluous before they come into force.</p>
        <p>Personally, I had assumed that oil would enjoy one last hurrah in the early 2020s as a decade of under-investment drives prices to $150 or $200. But this does not seem so inevitable any more. The rallies keep fading.</p>
        <p>The events of the last week suggest that the process of oil displacement is more advanced than we had assumed. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the petrostates have already entered the first stage of terminal run-off.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Path Trading Partners Co-Founder and Chief Market Strategist Bob Iaccino joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the rise of gold prices, the catalyst, and how inflation plays a part.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: You're looking at gold off a little bit today, pulling back from a 13-month high on weaker economic data. Still, though, obviously, above 2,000. Gold since the start of the year up just about 10%, hovering above that critical $2,000 level here, and just trading just about 50 bucks below its record high. We want to bring in Bob Iaccino. He's Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. Bob, it's good to see you here. So we're holding above that 2,000 level. I think a lot of investors are asking if there's really upside here to the price of gold. What do you think?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: I think there is. Gold was my big call for the year. I'm sticking with that as of this point. I still think we're going into recession, although the timeline may be pushed a little bit. The yield curve says we're already there. Economic data is going to start to slow. And if you're long gold, which I am, the best case scenario is the Fed cuts rates to get you into-- or I'm sorry, out of a recession, which is positive for gold.</p>
        <p>Worst case scenario, the Fed continues to raise rates. I think this is the least likely. And they hold-- or they hold the pause a little bit longer. Two out of three of these cases is good for gold. The worst case scenario is that they hold the pause, and we actually get this soft landing or easy landing or even no landing. That wouldn't be great for gold, and I think that's the least likely scenario.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Fed certainly plays a role. Bob, talk about some of the other factors driving the prices where they are today.</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, again, you have this issue of asset prices being sold off. And gold has always taken advantage of that. And what's generally happened is, the Fed-- again, bringing that out-- cuts rates to help the economy and help asset prices. That's been a driver of gold in the past. And a lot of people believed that. CME Fed watch tool has cuts starting in July of this year, which the Fed says they're not going to do.</p>
        <p>Another one is people think of gold as an inflation hedge. And it's really not. What gold is, is it's an asset. And if you look at assets in general, when inflation starts and then continues to rise through, gold powers through that because it's an asset, just like house prices, just like stocks. We forget the good part about inflation is asset inflation, and gold is an asset. The problem comes in for gold investors when the Fed starts to aggressively fight inflation.</p>
        <p>So something we haven't had, which has contributed to gold's underperformance over the last decade or so, was we haven't had inflation, so we haven't had a Fed to fight inflation. And that's kind of gave gold this weakness. When inflation started, gold rallied. We saw that March spike that references almost the all-time high that Seana mentioned. We're driving toward that again. And if we are in a situation where, as Neil Dutta from Renaissance or at Macro put it, inflation remains unaddressed, then gold's going to benefit from that.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: Bob, how much upside is there to gold? Are we talking 2,500? Are we talking above that?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, here's where people think I'm nuts. I think we can easily break to new highs. And I think if it goes the way I think it's going to go, easily within the next 12 months, we could see 2,800. I used to say by the end of the year. I'm not saying that anymore because I think the Fed was much more aggressive than I thought they would be when I made that call.</p>
        <p>But I think the issue here is the popular opinion and the politically popular opinion is that the Fed should stop trying to fight inflation. And I don't think people realize how bad that is for the whole country, as opposed to just 2 or 3 million people. And I don't mean to downplay that. I want to stress that.</p>
        <p>But the 2 or 3 million people that may lose their jobs in a recession, a recession, as investors should look at it, is good for gold. I'm sorry, it's good for stocks. It's not necessarily good for gold. Where gold outperforms is when there's inflation and a recession. And I think that's what we're going to because I think the Fed is going to cave in to pressure and stop fighting inflation.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: 2,800 call-- gutsy. All right, Bob, with that, we want to play a little game. We want to see how deep your love for gold goes. We're calling this Bob's Buys. We'll give you a choice between two investments. You'll tell us which is the buy and why. First up, Bitcoin, which has been surging with gold, which seems a little odd on its face. So Bitcoin or gold?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: So I have to ask you a question first, and we actually did this with a recent guest on our podcast. Is this 100% in one or the other?</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Is it 100%? I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: You mean all in on gold or all in on Bitcoin?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Yeah, can I go 70/30, or I can't do that?</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I see what you're saying.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: Yeah, sure, you can make your own twist to the game. We're open to suggestions, Bob.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Well, look at you making up your own rules. I was going to say 100%, but go, go.</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, actually, if you make me pick 100, it's gold. I am actually in about 70% gold, 30% Bitcoin for that amount of the capital that we allocate to this sort of space because I think the issue with Bitcoin is, is it here in 10 years or not? I think it is, but I don't run that sort of part of the game, so.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, Bob, well, we're setting you up here because we have a couple to get through. So the next one's up is treasuries, TIPS, or gold? What do you think?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Gold.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: You're sticking with it. Didn't even have to think twice about it.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: I want to get back to the prior answer. What do you make of the dynamic, though? Gold rising typically tells us people are risk averse. How does that rise with arguably the most speculative asset on the planet in Bitcoin? How do those rise together?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: So Bitcoin has a couple of things going for it. It's, again, beginning to perform in a non-correlated way, which I like. It hadn't done that. It was correlated very sharply to the NASDAQ. That's not the case anymore, at least in the short-term. If that sticks with it, then a non-correlated asset is always good in any environment. So that's really the core of it.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, Bob, and last up here, I bonds or gold? What do you think?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Wow, that one's tough. I'm going to have to say gold, too. But I think if you put me in a position, I'd go 60% gold, 40% I bonds.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, there we go. All right, gold the winner of all three. You're the gold guy, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised by that. Bob, great to see you. Thanks so much.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- For months, the Middle Eastern oil market has been among the tightest in the world as regional exporters support Asia’s recovering demand. This week, OPEC+’s surprise output cuts made it even stronger.</p>
        <p>Key markers in the Dubai crude market — the benchmark for Middle Eastern grades — leapt higher after the Saudi-led decision. The most active timespread for Dubai swaps jumped to above $1 a barrel in backwardation, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd, outperforming the Brent curve.</p>
        <p>While OPEC+’s production cuts will take effect only next month, Dubai’s strength reflects expectations that the reductions will strengthen an already-robust market for Middle Eastern supplies. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait pledged to cut a combined 980,000 barrels a day of output, with generally heavier and more sulfurous crude as the bulk of their production.</p>
        <p>That’s likely to lift the relative value of Dubai crude — which is both a proxy for Middle Eastern oil markets as well as medium-sour oil varieties — against global benchmarks such as Brent even further, a shot in arm for long-haul cargo flows from the Atlantic Basin and Americas into Asia.</p>
        <p>Even prior to the OPEC+ cuts, traders were already bullish on Dubai versus other crudes, as red-hot Chinese demand hoovers up the region’s supplies and lackluster European consumption weighs on Brent.</p>
        <p>“Given the bulk of the cuts stem from medium and heavy Middle Eastern producers, we would not be surprised to see Dubai trade at a premium to Brent in the coming months, particularly as China looks to ramp imports,” RBC analysts including Mike Tran and Helima Croft wrote in a report.</p>

        <h3>By Seher Dareen</h3>
        <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices hit their highest since March 2022 on Wednesday, extending a rally after weaker U.S. economic readings bolstered bets U.S. interest rates will rise more slowly.</p>
        <p>Spot gold was up 0.1% to $2,022.79 per ounce by 1120 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were unchanged at $2,038.10.</p>
        <p>Analysts said gold was well-placed to sustain gains above the $2,000 level as weaker prospects for interest dilute the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, which is also a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.</p>
        <p>"The 'third time's the charm' for gold, having probed above the $2,000 level in both August 2020 and March 2022. This time it appears to be able to sustain the momentum as dark clouds gather within the economy," independent analyst Ross Norman said.</p>
        <p>He said weaker economic data had shifted the emphasis from "inflation-busting to saving the wider economy".</p>
        <p>Gold rallied 2% on Tuesday after U.S. job openings in February dropped to the lowest in nearly two years.</p>
        <p>The dollar index edged higher, yet still near two-month lows, making bullion cheaper for buyers holding other currencies. [USD/]</p>
        <p>There has also been an improvement in the gold market mood, said Carsten Menke, head of Next Generation Research at Julius Baer in a note, "indicated by the return of short-term speculative traders and trend followers".</p>
        <p>Euro zone recovery gathered pace last month but the upturn was uneven, and the ECB could raise rates by 25 basis points at its May, June and July meetings a Reuters poll found.</p>
        <p>While the markets expect a pause on U.S. rate hikes in May, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said the central bank likely had more rate hikes ahead, pushing the terminal rate over 5%.</p>
        <p>Traders also await economic cues from the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday.</p>
        <p>Silver was down 1.1% to $24.74 per ounce, platinum gained 0.6% to $1,022.99 while palladium jumped 1.2% to $1,474.73.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil eked out a gain after a report showed that US job openings in February fell to the lowest since 2021, reigniting concerns over a global economic slowdown.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate settled above $80 paring gains on disappointing labor data after initially rising almost 2%. Before the US economic report, prices had extended the largest rally in a year stemming from the surprise decision Sunday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to slash crude production by over 1 million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Short-term upside is limited until the market sees more inventory draws and stronger demand, said Jonathan Wagner, global head of crude options at Marex North America. “In this macro environment, ahead of payrolls this Friday, the signal of employers not looking for workers is not helping,” said Wagner.</p>
        <p>Crude has soared about 20% from the low point in mid-March. The rebound was driven initially by expectations Chinese demand would pick up following the end of restrictive Covid policies. The OPEC+ surprise decision allowed markets to rally the most in a year, with the move being aimed to punish speculators that bet oil prices would fall.</p>
        <p>While uber-bull Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded their price forecasts in the wake of the decision, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. kept forecasts unchanged. Morgan Stanley even lowered its outlook, noting China’s demand growth has lagged behind expectations.</p>
        <p>The market largely ignored the potential resumption of oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region on Tuesday. The region’s government said it will sign an agreement that may clear the path to restart shipments via the Turkish port of Ceyhan.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil said it’s restarting units over the coming days at the oil complex near Le Havre in France that had been halted after protests disrupted supplies.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Teck Resources Ltd. is willing to entertain offers from potential suitors after it finishes the spinoff of its steelmaking coal business, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
        <p>The Canadian miner said Monday it rejected an unsolicited $23 billion proposal from Glencore Plc and will forge ahead with an April 26 shareholder vote on separating its metals and coal divisions. If investors approve, the split is expected to happen by the end of May, with the base metals producer being renamed Teck Metals Corp.</p>
        <p>At that point, the Teck board is likely to be open to hearing offers from prospective partners or buyers including Glencore, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.</p>
        <p>The Swiss commodities firm’s offer for Teck, at a 20% premium, is another sign that big mining companies are on the hunt for acquisitions. BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto Plc are also said to be actively looking to increase their copper exposure.</p>
        <p>“The board and special committee are confident that the proposed separation into Teck Metals and Elk Valley Resources is in the best interests of Teck and all its stakeholders,” Chris Stannell, a spokesperson for Teck, said in an emailed statement. “Teck’s proposed separation positions Teck Metals and EVR for success and does not foreclose future opportunities for other value-enhancing transactions at the appropriate point and time.”</p>
        <p>In rejecting Glencore’s all-share offer, Teck Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Price said Monday that the spinoff structure proposed by the Swiss firm would expose Teck shareholders to its large thermal coal and oil trading businesses. Norman Keevil, Teck’s chairman emeritus, said that “now is not the time to explore a transaction of this nature.”</p>
        <p>Teck has also proposed ending the dual-class share structure that gives control to Class A shareholders — the Keevil family and its partners. But that change wouldn’t take effect for six years. In the meantime, a hostile takeover of Teck is impossible.</p>

        <p>Commodities declined in the first quarter, with the energy sector leading the way as markets were jolted in March by sudden stress in the U.S. banking system. Prices for natural gas lost more than half of their value and touched their lowest level in more than two years.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Europe has negotiated through the winter of a crisis that threatened to choke energy supplies and overwhelm its economy, but officials are warning that the squeeze may not yet be over.</p>
        <p>Fears of blackouts and freezing homes have faded for now, and gas reserves remain far fuller than normal. The region is entering a crucial period of replenishing those stockpiles, and avoiding a crunch next winter hinges on its success. It won’t be able to rely on the usually massive supply of pipeline gas from Russia, and EU officials are leaning on companies to end LNG imports from the country.</p>
        <p>The perils from a year ago will be fresh on policy makers’ minds. Heat waves, the worst drought in centuries, nuclear outages in France and overall panic about Russia’s dwindling gas exports resulted in a record surge in prices. They’ve fallen more than 80% since then, and the outlook holds few worries for the months ahead. BloombergNEF sees enough supplies available to fill inventories to the EU’s goal of 90% by the end of October.</p>
        <p>The market remains wary a repeat of last year’s events will flip the balance once again. There are also new worries about a rebound in Chinese demand, and an even deeper curtailment in Russian supplies — pipeline and liquefied natural gas, said Andrew Walker, a vice president at major LNG provider Cheniere Energy Inc.</p>
        <p>“There are a lot of key risks sitting out there,” he said at the European Gas Conference in Vienna.</p>
        <p>With summer coming and small volumes of gas already starting to be sent into storage sites, here are some of the biggest concerns for the continent.</p>
        <p>China and Fight for LNG</p>
        <p>Record LNG imports formed the backbone of Europe’s efforts to tackle the crisis over the past year. But the jostling for cargoes could start increasing.</p>
        <p>The International Energy Agency has warned that Europe still faces a risk of supply shortages this year, unless it further curbs consumption, with China’s LNG demand being the biggest unknown. The agency has a 40 billion cubic meters difference between its highest and lowest estimates for the nation’s net LNG imports this year. That’s the equivalent of about 8% of Europe’s total demand last year.</p>
        <p>Some industry watchers, like Wood Mackenzie, are not very bullish, at least for now. The consultant expects China’s booming domestic gas production and continued increase in Russia’s pipeline supplies to limit the need for LNG imports, and keep them below the peak of 2021 even in a high-growth scenario.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, cheaper LNG is also bringing back appetite from smaller buyers in Asia, which increases competition, according to trader Vitol Group.</p>
        <p>Industrial Demand Recovery</p>
        <p>Signs are emerging that gas use by industry — which made up almost half of total demand reduction in Europe last year — is rebounding. A recovery is showing in the oil refining and petrochemical industries in Spain, the Netherlands and France, where it is easier to switch fuels than in other sectors.</p>
        <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and SEB AB have warned that gas prices may more than double from current levels if industrial demand returns. But how big will the rebound be? Many manufacturers shut or relocated some operations last year as energy costs turned prohibitive, and there’s no certainty they will return. An unfolding banking crisis could also hit European industries.</p>
        <p>Fuel Switching</p>
        <p>Declining gas prices are making it attractive again for Europe’s power stations, in comparison to alternatives like coal or oil.</p>
        <p>Coal power generation in Europe increased last year, ending a run of steady declines. It has been lower so far this year — as has gas — because of higher renewables output, primarily wind. But, gas use for electricity outstripped coal at times over the past month, according to consultant Rystad Energy AS. The shift is also aided by more expensive carbon permits, which are needed by power stations to spew emissions.</p>
        <p>French Nukes</p>
        <p>Electricite de France SA’s troubles are quickly turning out to be one of the biggest risks to Europe avoiding another crisis next winter. The beleaguered utility’s nuclear stations have suffered from technical errors, contributing to a record number of reactors going offline last year in the country and pushing atomic output to the lowest in 30 years.</p>
        <p>As a result, power was the only sector in Europe where gas consumption remained relatively steady last year even though overall electricity demand declined, while wind and solar output jumped.</p>
        <p>EDF has found new defects that have caused energy prices to spike several times this month. While the company has left its nuclear power production forecast for this year unchanged, more problems would further strain power networks and increase demand for gas. Widespread strikes in the country haven’t helped either.</p>
        <p>Another Drought?</p>
        <p>Memories of the arterial Rhine River drying up and becoming impassable last year are still fresh, as is the record heat and droughts that limited hydroelectric and nuclear production. Climate change is making severe weather events more likely.</p>
        <p>The hydrological balance in the Alps — or the amount of energy stored in reservoirs and snowpack compared with seasonal norms — already shows the biggest deficit since 2017 for the time of year. Hot weather could boost demand for gas for cooling, and if the Rhine dries up again, it can disrupt the movement of coal and oil products to Germany.</p>
        <p>Russia Risk</p>
        <p>Russia’s share of total gas demand in the European Union dropped to under 10% by the end of last year from 40% in 2021 as most nations switched to alternatives such as US LNG. Even that little supply, especially the part coming by pipelines crossing Ukraine, has been under constant risk as the war moves into its second year.</p>
        <p>While pipeline flows have dwindled, imports of LNG — which aren’t restricted — from the country have surged. But there’s now growing pressure on European companies to end these purchases. Some like the UK and the Baltic nations have already banned these imports. The EU is targeting a way to allow members to follow suit but it isn’t implementing any new sanctions or announcing specific measures.</p>
        <p>Spain, one of Europe’s top buyers of the Russian fuel, has directly urged companies to reduce these purchases, but a blanket ban would be challenging to achieve.</p>
        <p>Russia accounted for 14% of total European LNG imports last year, said Leo Kabouche, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. If the region were to ban those flows, the loss would be “significant and would be extremely challenging to replace.”</p>
        <p>The possibility of a total cut off from Moscow, risks of infrastructure sabotage or unplanned outages at major projects this year — as well as competition with China — could put the gas market under pressure again, Matthew Baldwin, deputy director general of the European Commission’s energy department, said at the conference in Vienna.</p>
        <p>“We experienced unprecedented, volatile energy prices last year, it looks better but we are not complacent,” he said. “We are not out of the woods. So we stay vigilant, we stay together.”</p>

        <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices retreated on Wednesday as investors trickled back into riskier assets betting that risks of contagion from the global banking crisis have been curbed for now.</p>
        <p>Spot gold was trading 0.4% lower at $1,965.89 per ounce, as of 0924 GMT. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.3% to $1,967.50.</p>
        <p>Gold has retreated as "markets are going risk-on as fears of contagion within the banking sector abates," said independent analyst Ross Norman.</p>
        <p>European shares rose, echoing an upbeat mood in Asian markets. [.EU]</p>
        <p>Further pressuring bullion, the U.S. dollar firmed 0.2%. A stronger dollar makes bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. [USD/]</p>
        <p>Gold traders, meanwhile, remained focused on the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy, with investors pricing in a 40.5% chance of a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>
        <p>Last week, the central bank suggested it was on the verge of pausing future hikes, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to reining in inflation.</p>
        <p>"Our outlook for the second half of 2023 for gold remains positive but not outrageously so as inflation persists and the Fed continues to try and edge rates higher until something breaks," Norman added.</p>
        <p>Higher rates tend to dull zero-yield gold's appeal.</p>
        <p>"The Fed will have to choose between higher inflation, a harder landing or financial instability - all outcomes will keep safe havens in play," likely prompting gold to retest and pierce all-time highs ($2,070/oz) this year, metals firm MKS PAMP said in a note.</p>
        <p>U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly increased in March, but Americans are becoming a bit anxious about the labour market, a survey showed on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil rose for a third session on Wednesday as a halt to some exports from Iraqi Kurdistan raised concerns of tightening supply and as easing fears of a global banking crisis supported risk sentiment in the wider markets.</p>
        <p>Crude exports of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region were halted on Saturday following an arbitration decision that confirmed Baghdad's consent was needed to ship the oil.</p>
        <p>Brent crude climbed 42 cents, or 0.5%, to $79.07 a barrel by 0802 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude increased 61 cents, or 0.8%, to $73.81.</p>
        <p>"The longer the stoppage continues, the tighter the supply outlook will become," said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Norwegian oil firm DNO said it had begun shutting down production at its fields in Kurdistan. The company's Tawke and Peshkabir fields averaged output of 107,000 bpd in 2022, a quarter of total Kurdish exports.</p>
        <p>Also helping sentiment was easing worries over the banking sector after weeks of volatility in the market that had sent oil to a 15-month low on March 20, with investor nerves soothed by the sale of assets in collapsed lender Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
        <p>"The recent rebound in oil prices is mainly driven by sentiment. We can see that risk sentiment has recovered to some extent, which pushed (the) global stock markets and crude oil rebound," said CMC Markets analyst Leon Li.</p>
        <p>Oil also gained support from a drop in U.S. crude inventories. According to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday, crude stocks fell by 6.1 million barrels.</p>
        <p>Attention will focus on official U.S. inventory data from the Energy Information Administration at 1430 GMT to see if it confirms the crude stock decline.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil clung to gains as a disagreement between Iraq and Kurdish officials curtailed exports and fears of a banking meltdown receded.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate edged forward Tuesday and has recovered almost 10% since dropping to a 15-month low in the immediate aftermath of the banking crisis. A legal dispute between Iraq, Kurdistan, and Turkey has halted around 400,000 barrels a day of flows, constricting global supplies.</p>
        <p>The market shrugged off concerns of a buildup of crude vessels along the coast of France as widespread strikes there forced most of the nation’s fuelmakers to halt operations. Strong Asian demand for the barrels has prevented prices from sliding.</p>
        <p>While oil has rallied from recent lows as the banking sector stabilizes, it remains on track for a fifth monthly decline amid concerns over a potential US recession and resilient Russian energy flows. Most market watchers are still betting that China’s recovery will accelerate and boost prices later this year as demand rebounds.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, OPEC+ is showing no signs of adjusting oil production when it meets next week, staying the course amid turbulence in financial markets, delegates said.</p>
        <p>Investors will also be watching comments from several US Federal Reserve officials, as well as a key measure of US inflation due this week, for clues on the path forward for monetary policy. Interest-rate hikes have added to bearish sentiment.</p>

        <p>Investors are flocking to gold exchange-traded funds following weakness in the banking sector and a subsequent slump in confidence.</p>
        <p>The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the largest gold ETF, has pulled in $489 million so far this year, etf.com data shows. That’s a reversal from the more than $1 billion in outflows the fund saw in the last quarter of 2022, the data shows. Meanwhile, the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) has hauled in $431 million during the same period.</p>
        <p>Last week, gold prices surged beyond $2,000 an ounce on rekindled fears of a banking crisis in the wake of the Credit Suisse takeover. That’s the first time bullion has traded above $2,000 since March 2022.</p>
        <p>Though spot gold prices eased slightly to $1,969 by Tuesday, they remain 7.7% higher than the $1,826 at which the metal started the year. Meanwhile, gold futures have inched up 7.6% year to date to $1,986.</p>
        <p>But that uptick in price and rush to gold ETFs may be due to a crisis of confidence, as recent tumult in the U.S. banking industry led to the collapse of several banks before spreading to Europe and rattling that continent’s financial sector, according to Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.</p>
        <p>“Gold can't go bankrupt,” Rhind said in an interview with etf.com. “People have always fled to gold in an environment where they don't have confidence in putting money in a bank account or buying bonds from either a government or from a corporation.”</p>
        <p>GLD has gained 7.3% year to date, according to etf.com data, while GLDM has jumped 7% as concerns over banking failures remain elevated. Deutsche Bank stock has sunk more than 22% in the past month on renewed market jitters.</p>
        <p>Also spurring the gold rally could be a weaker U.S. dollar and a prospective easing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve,” said Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion.</p>
        <p>“Gold and even silver are very sensitive to dollar strength or weakness; there's an inverse relationship between those two,” he added.</p>
        <p>“You've had a weaker dollar here, a little bit of a shift with the Fed in terms of maybe how aggressive they're going to be going forward. As a result, rates have started to drop,” Egilinsky explained, noting how the factors have given gold more traction.</p>

        <p>Halliburton and Honeywell in advanced talks to develop oil fields and refineries in Libya; Eni importing more oil and gas from Algeria</p>
        <p>CAIRO—After years of underinvestment in North Africa’s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows.</p>
        <p>Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals.</p>
        <p>Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy’s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria.</p>
        <p>Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt.</p>
        <p>“North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,” said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy, “this is their moment,” he said.</p>
        <p>Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region’s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say.</p>
        <p>At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food. The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices.</p>
        <p>“I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,” NOC’s Mr. Bengdara said.</p>
        <p>The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.</p>
        <p>Halliburton and Total didn’t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Libya’s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant.</p>
        <p>Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports.</p>
        <p>As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country’s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021.</p>
        <p>Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias.</p>
        <p>The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia’s paramilitary Wagner Group, the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country’s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya, is aligned with the government in Tripoli.</p>
        <p>“There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,” said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as “an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.”</p>
        <p>NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion.</p>
        <p>In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country’s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026.</p>
        <p>In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm’s top region for investment in the next four years.</p>
        <p>“Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,” said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January.</p>
        <p>From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year.</p>
        <p>Egypt’s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn’t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.</p>

        <p>Yahoo Finance’s Ines Ferre joins the Live show to discuss the dip in oil prices after the U.S. signaled it will wait before refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).</p>
        <p>JARED BLIKRE: Energy markets dipping on worries about an oversupply, especially after the US signaled it will wait before refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The SPR weakness there contributing to the overall gloom in the markets. Here with more is Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines.</p>
        <p>INES FERRE: Yeah, Jared, and this lower oil prices, it's really having an impact on energy as a whole, energy stocks, equities as well. Let's take a look at our YFi Interactive board so we can see where the underlying commodity crude oil is right now. You're looking at WTI that is down more than 1 and 1/2%. You've got crude right now that is on pace for its biggest first quarter drop since 2020. That's when the pandemic hit, and you saw demand being wiped out. This week, we had a little bit of a rebound when it came to oil, but today, we are seeing losses, taking out a big chunk of the gains that we had seen this week.</p>
        <p>Also, Brent crude down 1.8%. Remember that last week, you had oil that, on a weekly basis last week, lost almost 10% of its value. A lot of this has to do with a stronger dollar, which is impacting the price of oil because oil is invoiced in dollars. You've got the US now that is holding off on refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as you just mentioned, Jared. Also, you have Russian oil that is still coming into the market, despite the Western sanctions. And then you've got concerns about a US recession, and the banking concerns, the banking worries deepening worries of a recession. You've got institutions that are selling their oil futures.</p>
        <p>Now, we have been seeing Wall Street sort of pulling back a little bit on their forecast when it comes to crude oil for the end of the year, but not as much as you would think. I mean, one of the commentaries that I saw out there is that this isn't necessarily like 2008, where oil touched a low of $39 a barrel. Analysts aren't seeing oil going that much lower. But nonetheless, we are seeing a selloff when it comes to oil recently.</p>
        <p>And then just taking a look at other commodities, look, if you are a gold bug, you are happy this week because gold touched $2,000 an ounce. I've spoken to analysts saying, this is it for gold, guys. The gold is coming out-- is breaking out from here. We'll see, but certainly, one analyst telling me, 2024, that's going to be huge for gold. Guys.</p>

        <p>In this article, we take a look at 15 largest oil fields in the world. If you want to see more largest oil fields in the world, go directly to 5 Largest Oil Fields in the World.</p>
        <p>Oil fields are areas where there is substantial oil in multiple oil reservoirs that are trapped by impermeable rock above. In oil reservoirs, oil exists as tiny droplets inside open spaces called pores inside rocks. Given the pressure that exists deep beneath the surface, oil can squeeze through tiny pores of underground rock. Furthermore, given the earth's natural heat deep below ground in some fields, oil also wants to squeeze to the areas above.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy describes the process, "Oil in a reservoir acts something like the air in a balloon. The pressure comes from millions of tons of rock lying on the oil and from the earth’s natural heat that builds up in an oil reservoir and expands any gases that may be in the rock. The result is that when an oil well strikes an underground oil reservoir, the natural pressure is released—like the air escaping from a balloon. The pressure forces the oil through the rock and up the well to the surface."</p>
        <p>Some oil fields are offshore while others are onshore. Many oil fields also produce natural gas, although the total mix of oil and gas can vary substantially from oil field to oil field. Depending on their location and geology, the cost to extract oil from oil fields can vary as well. For those of you interested, check out 15 Countries That Produce the Most Oil in the World.</p>
        <p>Many of the world's largest oil fields are in the Middle East as several countries in the region have substantial reserves of oil. Many of the world's most economical to extract oil fields are also in the Middle East given the region's favorable geology.</p>
        <p>Because they have operational expertise and capital, big oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) sometimes help nations develop some of their oil fields. In addition to extracting oil from oil fields, oil companies also have to transport the oil often through pipeline to export facilities or to refineries that do further processing.</p>
        <p><strong>The World's Largest Oil Fields</strong></p>
        <p>In terms of the world's largest oil fields, some of the largest oil fields have already produced a lot of oil like China's Daqing Field which began full scale production in 1963. Meanwhile others like Kazakhstan's Kashagan Field are relatively new.</p>
        <p>Given their size and the importance of oil, some of the world's largest oil fields are also important to the global economy. The world's largest oil field, Saudi Arabia's Ghawar Field, for instance, produces around 4 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for well over 1/3 of Saudi Arabia's total production. Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of oil in the world, with crude oil exports of 7.28 million barrels per day in November of 2022.

        <p><strong>Crude Oil</strong></p>
        <p>In terms of crude oil, the price of the commodity has fallen recently as economists worry of an economic slowdown as a result of the recent Silicon Valley Bank failure. If oil prices decline, companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) might not be as profitable as they could have been.</p>
        <p>In the longer term, the world will need to reduce its dependence on crude oil as a transportation fuel to reduce carbon emissions. In the near and medium terms, however, the world is expected to continue to need crude oil for transportation and for many refined crude products.</p>
        <p>In terms of oil prices, it isn't clear where they will go as many factors can influence the oil price.</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
        <p>For our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World, we used Stacker's Largest oil fields in the world list and data from Stacker. Given the company's calculations, it isn't clear whether the data is barrels of oil or barrels of oil equivalent, which could include natural gas.</p>
        <p>Stacker includes cumulative past production in its oil field size data. Because some mega oil fields have already produced much of their oil, they don't have as much future production capability but nevertheless still rank on our list.</p>
        <p>We ranked the oil fields based on the total reserves based on cumulative past and future production potential.</p>
        <h3><strong>15 Largest Oil Fields in the World</strong></h3>
        <h3>15. Marun Field</h3>
        <p><strong>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 22 billion barrels</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Country: Iran</strong></p>
        <p>Iran was the eighth largest producer of oil in 2021 with production of 3.6 million barrels per day in the year. As the country's second largest producing oil field, Marun Field is one reason why. Discovered in 1963, the oil field produced around 1 million barrels per day at its peak in the 1970's and the field still produces around 600,000 barrels of oil per day according to a Bloomberg article in 2020.</p>
        <h3>14. Samotlor Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 25 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Russia</strong></p>
        <p>Russia is an energy superpower with substantial oil and gas reserves. As far as oil fields go, Samotlor Field is the country's largest oil field with 25 billion barrels of cumulative past production and future production potential. Like Marun Field, Samotlor Field is an oil field that has already produced a lot of oil. At its peak, the field produced around 3 million barrels per day in the 1980's.</p>
        <h3>13. Prudhoe Bay</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 25 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: United States</strong></p>
        <p>Prudhoe Bay is America's largest oil field in terms of total oil reserves when including cumulative past oil production. The Alaskan oil field has been active for over four decades and still has over 800 active wells. Although production in Prudhoe Bay is declining and well below its peak in the 1980's, U.S. oil production has nevertheless increased over the years, ranking the country #1 in the world in terms of oil production in 2021 with 16.59 million barrels per day produced in 2021.</p>
        <h3>12. Tengiz Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 26 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Kazakhstan</strong></p>
        <p>Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field ranks #12 on our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World given its total oil reserves of 26 billion barrels based on past and future production. Tengiz Field is the country's highest oil producing field with official capacity of 600,000 barrels per day as of 2022. With a planned expansion, however, the oil field could have oil production capacity of 850,000 barrels per day by 2024.</p>
        <h3>11. Kashagan Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 30 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Kazakhstan</strong></p>
        <p>Kashagan Field is another giant oil field in Kazakhstan with substantial oil reserves. According to estimates, the Kashagan Field could have 30 billion barrels of oil reserves when including cumulative past production, ranking it among the largest in the world. As a country, Kazakhstan had total oil production of around 1.6 million barrels per day in 2022 and S&P Global Platts Analytics expects Kazakhstan's oil output to reach 2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 2.6 million barrels per day by 2030.</p>
        <h3>10. Aghajari Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 30.2 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Iran</strong></p>
        <p>Aghajari Field in Iran is one of the oldest big oil fields in the world given it was first discovered in 1938. Although it has total oil reserves based on cumulative past production and future production potential of 30.2 billion barrels, much of the oil in Aghajari Field has already been produced.</p>
        <h3>9. Bolivar Coastal Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 32 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Venezuela</strong></p>
        <p>Venezuela's Bolivar Coastal Field is the country's largest oil field and also one of the oldest given it was discovered in 1917. According to Stacker, Bolivar Coastal Field has total oil reserves based on cumulative past production and future production potential of 32 billion barrels.</p>
        <h3>8. Cantarell Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 35 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Mexico</strong></p>
        <p>Cantarell Field is comprised of four fields that was first discovered in 1972. Given the oil field has already produced a lot of oil, production in Cantarell Field is declining and the oil field was surpassed in 2009 as the biggest oil field in Mexico in terms of production.</p>
        <h3>7. Safaniya Oil Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 37 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Saudi Arabia</strong></p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia's Safaniya Oil Field is one of the two largest offshore oil fields in the world along with UAE's Upper Zakum Oil Field. According to Reuters, Safaniya Oil Field had production capacity of over 1 million barrels per day in 2019 and mainly produces heavy oil. It ranks #7 on our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World given its total oil reserves of 37 billion barrels when including cumulative past production.</p>
        <h3>6. Daqing Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 42 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: China</strong></p>
        <p>Daqing Field is China's largest oil field that still produces around a third of the country's total oil despite entering full scale production in 1963. Given its growing large economy and insufficient domestic oil production, China is the world's largest importer of oil and production from Daqing Field helps reduce imports.

      description: <div className="blog-desc">
        <p>Precious metals like gold and silver have been rallying lately. This is because investors have been seeking safe-haven investments amid growing risks emanating from the banking crisis in the United States and Europe, high inflation, hawkish central banks, fear of prolonged global growth slowdown and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China relations as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Precious metals like gold and silver have been rallying lately. This is because investors have been seeking safe-haven investments amid growing risks emanating from the banking crisis in the United States and Europe, high inflation, hawkish central banks, fear of prolonged global growth slowdown and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China relations as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
        <p>In the latest statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), to a funds range of 4.75%-5.00%. The move was largely expected. However, the Fed’s language in its statement grew notably milder from the last meeting, even as it clearly stated that inflation is still “elevated.” The Fed also indicated that “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”</p>
        <p>A softening in the Fed’s hawkish tone and the resultant decline in U.S. rates should weigh on the dollar against a basket of currencies, raising the precious metals’ attractiveness as these do not pay interest like fixed-income assets. Notably, the U.S. dollar is now at a seven-week low. Analysts believe that precious metal prices will witness momentum.</p>
        <p>The Fed indicated that further increases in borrowing costs might be postponed (or there may be just one more rate hike worth 25 bps this year) due to the recent failure of two U.S. banks. A low-interest-rate environment makes non-yielding bullion an intriguing bet. Plus, gold is traditionally viewed as an inflation hedge and thus is well-positioned to take advantage of the recent spike in global inflation.</p>
        <p>SPDR Gold Shares GLD has risen 8.1% in the past month, while iShares Silver Trust SLV has gained 4%. But in the past five days, SLV has added 5.8% versus a 2.7% uptick in GLD (as of Mar 22, 2023).</p>
        <h3>What to Buy Ahead? Gold or Silver</h3>
        <p>We believe that gold has run up a little bit higher. It’s just 1% off from its 52-week high whereas silver is still 13% off its 52-week high. So, the poor man’s gold has more room to run than the yellow metal. Moreover, the operating backdrop is more favorable for silver as it has high usage in industrial activities. About 50% of the total demand for silver comes from industrial applications.</p>
        <p>The Fed is likely to take less-hawkish actions, going forward. This should bolster industrial activities. Manufacturing activity in China expanded and logged its highest reading in nearly 11 years. China’s reopening following the COVID-led lockdown is a huge plus for the manufacturing sector.</p>
        <p>Growth in the global solar PV industry and new sources of demand for sensors used in IoT are providing a boost to silver demand. The recent emergence and faster rollout of 5G globally is another positive for silver. The electronic components that enable 5G technology depend on silver greatly. Silver’s role in electronic applications used in 5G is forecast to rise significantly.</p>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>If we go by the relative strength index (RSI), SLV has an RSI value of 64.31 while GLD has an RSI value of 66.95. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.</p>
        <p>Hence, the value indicates that while both ETFs are in high momentum, silver has good chances of outperforming gold. But if the economic backdrop remains this edgy, global growth slows down and inflation remains hot, gold will outshine the manufacturing metal silver.</p>
        <h3>ETFs in Focus</h3>
        <p>Apart from the largest ETF SLV, investors can also bet on the likes of Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF SIVR, Invesco DB Silver Fund (DBS) and ProShares Ultra Silver AGQ to realize gains in silver.</p>
        <p>And for gold ETFs, investing options include the likes of iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF SGOL and ProShares Ultra Gold UGL.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- European companies are using more natural gas as prices drop to levels seen before the Ukraine war, putting a potential strain on preparations for another winter with limited Russian supplies.</p>
        <p>The green shoots are mainly evident in the refining industry, which can switch more easily between raw materials ranging from natural gas to fuel oil. Earlier this month, Dutch data showed the country’s petroleum sector had the biggest weekly gain in gas use this year, while French and Spanish gas network figures indicated refiners’ demand advanced in February from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The speed of the recovery will be crucial for the European Union and how it readies for a second winter with no pipeline gas from Russia. Rebounding demand could push prices past €100 ($109) per megawatt-hour this year, from about €43 now, and chip away at stockpiles, according Swedish bank SEB AB. It’s a view echoed by Vitol Group, one of the biggest gas traders.</p>
        <p>“Some manufacturing industries last year shifted from gas to fuel,” said Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive officer at TotalEnergies SE. “Now this year they are very reactive, they shift back from diesel or fuel to gas, so it’s creating an additional demand,” he said at a presentation in London on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>European Refiners Eye Natural Gas Again After Price Drop: BNEF</p>
        <p>Along with refineries, petrochemical plants will also be a good indicator of the recovery because they can easily switch back to gas to make power and heat, according to Energy Aspects Ltd.</p>
        <p>“Other gas-intensive sectors will take longer to recover over the course of 2023 owing to their demand reductions being the result of reducing output rather than fuel switching,” the industry consultant said.</p>
        <p>As gas prices soared to records at the height of the energy crisis, Spanish industrial gas demand plunged as much as 40% in September from a year earlier. Overall usage by factories and plants slumped about 20% last year in Europe, accounting for almost half of the record drop in total consumption last year, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, the IEA expects demand in industry to recover by about 10%.</p>
        <p>From a peak above €340 per megawatt-hour in late August, benchmark Dutch gas futures have dropped about 90%. In February, usage by Spain’s refiners soared 8.1%, helping to pare an overall drop by industry to 9.5% from a year earlier, network operator Enagas SA said.</p>
        <p>In the Netherlands, gas use in the petroleum and the chemical industries have also started to exceed last year’s levels this month, CBS data show.</p>
        <p>“Lower energy costs — combined, possibly, with stronger demand from China’s reopening — mean that we expect industrial production to make some positive contributions to growth in the euro area this year,” said Maeva Cousin, a senior euro-area economist at Bloomberg Economics.</p>
        <p>While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the industrial recovery will start to gather pace by the end of this month, other analysts warned it could still be a while.</p>
        <p>“It will take time for gas tariffs from gas suppliers to fall enough and over a sustainable period for factory managers to take the decision to resume output,” Energy Aspects said.</p>
        <p>Factories Moving</p>
        <p>Despite the plunge in prices, they are still way above the historical average and are expected to remain elevated until about 2025 when new global supply is poised to arrive.</p>
        <p>That means some demand may be lost forever as factories relocated to parts of the world where energy costs are lower.</p>
        <p>Chemical firms BASF SE, Dow Inc. and Lanxess AG are poised to cut thousands of jobs and shift investment out of Germany because they don’t expect Berlin to reliably provide the energy they need at prices close to those they once paid for Russian pipeline gas.</p>
        <p>A survey from Germany’s VCI chemical association earlier this year revealed that almost half of companies plan to cut investment in the country this year due to high energy costs. Production is likely to shift to countries with similar values and political systems, said Oliver Wojahn, an analyst at Alsterresearch AG.</p>
        <p>“The outlook for the future has brightened somewhat in Germany’s third-largest industry,” VCI said in a report this month. “The major drop in energy and raw material prices in recent months has stabilized the situation where the bottom seems to have been reached. Unlike the pandemic or the global economic crisis, this time there will be no powerful recovery.”</p>

        <p>By Seher Dareen</p>
        <p>(Reuters) - Gold dipped on Friday in a volatile week that saw bullion prices north of the key $2,000 figure as bank contagion fears bolstered both safe-haven demand and bets on a pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
        <p>The U.S. dollar rose about 0.5%, making the greenback-priced gold more expensive among overseas buyers on Friday. [USD/]</p>
        <p>Spot gold fell 0.8% to $1,977.01 per ounce by 2:34 p.m. EDT (1834 GMT), after it rose to $2,002.89 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.6% to settle at $1,983.80.</p>
        <p>A somewhat firmer dollar and a rebound in equity markets and risk appetite are probably what has driven gold lower, said Bart Melek, head of commodity markets strategy at TD Securities. But bullion was likely to get continued support from big macro developments, Melek said. [MKTS/GLOB]</p>
        <p>Rescue measures for struggling banks eased contagion fears earlier in the week, putting gold on course for its first weekly decline in four, down about 0.5%, despite having climbed to its highest in a year above $2,000 on Monday.</p>
        <p>But banking shares were trounced again on Friday, with European giants Deutsche Bank and UBS knocked by worries that regulators and central banks have yet to contain the worst shock to the sector since the 2008 financial crisis. [.N]</p>
        <p>"Any concern that pops up about U.S. banks being undercapitalized is going to be a factor for gold to rise," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.</p>
        <p>Fed officials said there was no indication financial stress was worsening as they gathered at a policy meeting this week, a fact that allowed them to stay focused on lowering inflation with another interest rate increase.</p>
        <p>The U.S. central bank this week raised rates by an expected quarter of a percentage point but signalled it was on the verge of pausing.</p>
        <p>Silver eased 0.1% to $23.07, platinum fell 0.7% to $977.776, and palladium dropped 0.7% to $1,420.40.</p>

        <p>Rising interest rates have been putting downward pressure on gold, but the shaky banking sector recently pushed prices past the $2,000 mark. With investor confidence in banks waning, this could continue to bolster gold prices as they seek to add precious metals for safety.</p>

        <p>Rising interest rates have been putting downward pressure on gold, but the shaky banking sector recently pushed prices past the $2,000 mark. With investor confidence in banks waning, this could continue to bolster gold prices as they seek to add precious metals for safety.</p>
        <p>Along with the rescue of U.S. regional bank First Republic, Europe's Credit Suisse has been grabbing the financial news as of late with its recent rescue thanks to help from global investment bank UBS. Bank rescues can help re-instill market confidence, but more bank failures could continue to push investors to safe havens like gold.</p>
        <p>“Long-term damage has been done to the credibility of U.S. banks,” said Chintan Karnani, director of research at Insignia Consultants, who also noted in a MarketWatch report that the banking fallout could be just be the tip of the iceberg. “Significant price corrections (if any) in gold price will be for a very short period.”</p>
        <h3>3 Options for Gold Exposure</h3>
        <p>There are three options where investors can get gold exposure. For direct correlation to holding physical gold, consider the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), which is a fund that provides an enhanced physical bullion structure, offering the ease of purchase and sale that comes with being traded on an exchange.</p>
        <p>For a backdoor play on ancillary gold services, investors can also consider the Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM). If demand continues to rise for gold, this can have a domino effect on miners for indirect exposure to gold prices.</p>
        <p>Per SGDM’s fund description, the ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance of its underlying index, the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index. The index aims to track the performance of larger-sized gold companies whose stocks are listed on Canadian and major U.S. exchanges.</p>
        <p>The index uses a transparent, rules-based methodology designed to emphasize larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield, and the lowest long-term debt to equity. The index is reconstituted on a quarterly basis to reflect the companies that have the highest factor scores.</p>
        <p>Lastly, investors looking for gold exposure with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) component can consider the Sprott ESG Gold ETF (SESG). The fund directly sources from select gold producers that Sprott believe are leaders when it comes to ESG mining and sustainability.</p>
        <p>SESG also adds a backdoor play on gold prices, investing in ancillary services (i.e. mining) that support the gold market as opposed to the actual precious metal itself. In addition, the inclusion of an ESG filter gives conscious investors an opportunity to allocate capital to gold miners exhibiting ESG-friendly operations.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>A massive new gas pipeline to China could help reduce Russia's reliance on European buyers, but analysts say the project reveals a growing imbalance between the longtime strategic allies.</p>
        <p>Beijing emerged as an economic lifeline for Moscow last year, especially through energy purchases, after Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut off crucial trade links.</p>
        <p>Moscow is confident that the new pipeline -- Power of Siberia 2 -- is going ahead, but Beijing has so far avoided an explicit commitment.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the lagging response shows an imbalance favouring Beijing in energy deals between the two countries -- as well as China's wariness of over-reliance on Russia for fuel.</p>
        <p>China is "in no rush to sign anything unless the proposal is favourable and is shaped on China's terms," researcher Maria Shagina at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Berlin told AFP.</p>
        <p>The project was discussed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week.</p>
        <p>Putin said after talks with Xi that "all agreements have been reached" on the Power of Siberia 2 project.</p>
        <p>But their joint statement only said the two sides will work on pushing forward "research and consultation" on the pipeline.</p>
        <p>The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for more details.</p>
        <p>Power of Siberia 2 could facilitate the transport of 50 billion cubic metres of gas to China annually, roughly on par with the total capacity of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany.</p>
        <p>A senior Russian official suggested last year that it could strategically replace Nord Stream 2.</p>
        <p>- 'Russia is desperate' -</p>
        <p>Previously the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Russia's gas exports plummeted in 2022 after a flurry of Western sanctions over the Ukraine war.</p>
        <p>As Europe looked for other suppliers, Moscow turned to alternative buyers including China, with which it is already linked by the first Power of Siberia pipeline.</p>
        <p>In 2022, China overtook Germany to become the top buyer of Russian energy. It has paid a total of $12.2 billion for coal, gas and oil from Russia so far this year, according to the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.</p>
        <p>Russian gas deliveries to China through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline reached a record 15.5 billion cubic metres last year.</p>
        <p>But sales to Asia pale in comparison with the 155 billion cubic metres of gas Russia exported to Europe prior to the Ukraine war.</p>
        <p>"Russia is desperate to send as much gas as possible eastwards as Europe strives to reduce its dependence on Russian gas," said Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute.</p>
        <p>And a potential Power of Siberia 2 gas deal would consolidate China as a long-term market, said Jaime Concha, a gas market expert at industry analysis firm Energy Intelligence.</p>
        <p>Russia's existing pipeline infrastructure "was mostly structured to cater to the European market", Concha told AFP.</p>
        <p>Building up an equivalent network in Asia would be costly and time-consuming, he said, "which shows how few alternatives Russia has".</p>
        <p>- 'Lessons from Europe' -</p>
        <p>China, meanwhile, has sought to ensure a diverse set of energy suppliers.</p>
        <p>It has signed a flurry of long-term gas deals around the world in recent years, including a $60 billion, 27-year agreement with Qatar in November.</p>
        <p>"Chinese policymakers also observe the lessons from Europe of overreliance on Russian energy imports," said Yan Qin, lead carbon analyst at Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>With a strengthened position in energy negotiations with Russia, "China emerged as the winner from the war in Ukraine", IISS researcher Shagina told AFP.</p>
        <p>"Beijing capitalised on Moscow's international isolation and ramped up its purchases of heavily discounted Russian oil, gas, and coal."</p>
        <p>At the same time, China has felt the bite from the turmoil in global energy markets.</p>
        <p>The war in Ukraine has pushed thermal coal prices at China's Qinhuangdao port "almost as high as Europe", Qin said, while rising LNG prices have hit gas power plants and industrial users.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, she said, the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline could "enhance China's gas imports capacity greatly and potentially reduce China's LNG imports demand".</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>With the forces of geopolitics and social normalization trends converging, investors may want to consider energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. What exactly does that entail, though? For one thing, the underlying sector – especially the hydrocarbon arena – will command long-term relevance. While the ideological winds seek to replace fossil fuels, renewable sources often lack the energy density required to compete effectively.</p>
        <p>The other component that makes the below energy stocks exceptionally compelling is that they hit the sweet spot of being undervalued (by objective standards) but highly rated among Wall Street analysts. Further, it’s not just about the baseline assessment itself. Rather, each of the names below commands an average price target that implies double-digit reward potential.</p>
        <h3>PBF Energy (PBF)</h3>
        <p>A petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, and lubricants (among many other products), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) deserves special consideration as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With social normalization trends likely to increase traffic volume on our roadways, PBF offers an opportunity to profit. Indeed, since the January opener, PBG gained over 12% of its equity value.</p>
        <p>Financially, the company isn’t perfect but it holds its own. For instance, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 5.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, PBF’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.61 times, favorably below the industry median of 1.67 times.</p>
        <p>Operationally, the refiner posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, ranked better than 79.48% of the oil and gas sector. Most importantly regarding this topic of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices PBF at a forward multiple of 4.94. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 71.07% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PBG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.44, implying over 22% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Marathon Petroleum (MPC)</h3>
        <p>A petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is one of the larger players in its field. At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $56 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MPC returned shareholders almost 14%. In the past 365 days, it moved up 58%. Still, it technically ranks as one of the underrated energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot.</p>
        <p>Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.42. As a discount to earnings, Marathon Petroleum ranks better than 68.76% of sector rivals. In addition, MPC trades at 0.36 times sales. However, the sector median value, in this case, is 0.93 times.</p>
        <p>Notably, Marathon carries an Altman Z-Score of just under 4, indicating an enterprise safe from bankruptcy. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA pings at 1.12 times, below the sector median of 1.67 times. Moreover, Marathon’s a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%. Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $147.92, implying over 17% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Valero Energy (VLO)</h3>
        <p>A downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it covers other petrochemical products and power. Because of the ongoing social normalization trends, VLO easily represents one of the more relevant energy stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, they’re up nearly 37%.</p>
        <p>Even with the tremendous upside, VLO technically remains underrated. For instance, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.43. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than 68.61% of its peers. Also, VLO trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company beats out 80.23% of the industry.</p>
        <p>Further, Valero enjoys a robust balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.55. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, outpacing 76% of competitors. In closing, analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy (with one sell rating). Overall, the average price target comes out to $161.67, implying over 25% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY)</h3>
        <p>Based in Houston, Texas, Magnolia Oil & Gas (NYSE:MGY) is one of the underrated energy stocks for good reason. Since the beginning of this year, MGY fell over 7%. In the past 365 days, it gave up nearly 15% of its equity value. Still, the exploration and production (upstream) company could be an intriguing idea to consider, especially if you like to gamble.</p>
        <p>First, Magnolia enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.73 times, outbidding 65.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.61, which ranks better than nearly 66% of the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.9%, while its net margin is nearly 53%. Both stats rank well into the industry’s upper half.</p>
        <p>Regarding valuation, the market prices MGY at a trailing multiple of 4.36. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) is 4.64 times, below the industry median of 7.3 times. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $29.67, implying nearly 45% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Devon Energy (DVN)</h3>
        <p>Focused on hydrocarbon exploration, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) commands a relevant profile among energy stocks. Unfortunately, DVN failed to resonate with investors so far this year. Since the Jan. opener, DVN gave up a worrying 19% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s off the mark by 23.5%. Nevertheless, for those that want to live a bit dangerously, DVN offers something to think about.</p>
        <p>Despite its market losses, Devon enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Notably, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times ranks better than 73.15% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.7% and a net margin of 31.38%. Both stats rank well in the upper half of the hydrocarbon sector.</p>
        <p>Most importantly for our discussion of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices DVN at a forward multiple of 5.75. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60.69% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DVN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target currently stands at $68.75, implying over 46% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Arch Resources (ARCH)</h3>
        <p>A coal mining and processing firm, Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the U.S. Per its public profile, Arch is the second-largest supplier of coal in the nation. Despite its relevancies, since the beginning of this year, ARCH slipped over 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down 13%.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, for contrarian investors, ARCH may be one of the energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. Presently, the market prices ARCH at a trailing multiple of 2.04. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.67% of sector players. Also, its price-to-FCF comes in at 2.65 times. Here, the applicable discount for Arch ranks better than 69.47% of the industry.</p>
        <p>Beyond the valuation, Arch benefits from a solid balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.43. Also, the coal firm’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 41%, above 74.15% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ARCH as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target pings at $201.33, implying nearly 54% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Evolution Petroleum (EPM)</h3>
        <p>Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. As with some of the riskier energy stocks, EPM looks shaky at the moment. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20%.</p>
        <p>Still, for the contrarian investor, EPM could also rank among the underappreciated energy stocks to buy. Financially, Evolution benefits from excellent strengths in the balance sheet. In particular, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.84 times, above 77.23% of the industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 5.51 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Regarding the theme at hand, the market prices EPM at a trailing multiple of 4.51. As a discount to earnings, Evolution ranks better than 68.46% of its rivals. Also, it trades at 2.82 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median value is 4.41. Lastly, Northland Securities’ Donovan Schafer, CFA, pegs EPM as a buy. Further, the expert anticipates shares hitting $11, implying nearly 97% upside potential.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Australian coal is finally flowing to China, opening up another avenue for shipments in what’s shaping up as an increasingly oversupplied market this year.</p>
        <p>Some 207,000 tons arrived in China in February, including 73,000 tons of the higher-grade coking coal prized by steel mills, according to customs data. Although the total is just a sliver of China’s massive import haul of over 60 million tons so far this year, they’re Australia’s first new cargoes since Beijing imposed its unofficial ban in late 2020 after relations with Canberra soured.</p>
        <p>Before the halt, Australia was China’s No. 2 overseas supplier after Indonesia. But that ranking has since been taken by Russia, which has seen its sales to China boom after other buyers shunned its product due to the invasion of Ukraine. Now, Australia is back in the mix, with imports that could rise to 20 million tons this year, according to one industry estimate.</p>
        <p>Steelmakers in particular are likely to be glad of the extra supply after Mongolia, another key miner of coking coal, launched a new auction system that raised prices for Chinese buyers, according to industry news portal Yulin Coal Web.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, China is mining record quantities of the fuel as it prioritizes energy security after a string of power outages in recent years. Output in the first two months climbed to 734 million tons. Including imports, Fengkuang Coal Logistics estimates that China had about 65 million tons of additional coal in the first two months compared to last year.</p>
        <p>The extra supply is doubtless designed to feed the reopening of China’s economy after three years of Covid Zero restrictions. But Beijing’s modest growth targets, as well as plans to curtail steel output, suggest the fuel has been secured out of an abundance of caution that could end up pressuring prices, limiting any windfall to Australia’s miners.</p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>The signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company in India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), and France’s leading energy oil and gas firm, TotalEnergies, as recently tweeted by the French company, may open the way for a renewed push by Western companies in China’s arch rival in the Far East. This, in turn, might begin to shift momentum back into the US’s longstanding plans for India to act as a key counterbalance to China’s ever-increasing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
        <p>The MoU between TotalEnergies and ONGC is geared towards the initial exploration of deepwater blocks, especially in and around Mahanadi and Andaman off India’s east coast, according to the French company’s tweet. Towards this end, ONGC last year also signed a heads of agreement with U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil for deepwater exploration on India’s east and west coasts. This latter deal will focus on the exploration of the Krishna Godavari and Cauvery Basins in the eastern offshore area and the Kutch-Mumbai region in the western offshore. According to ONGC’s director of exploration, Shri Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, the collaboration between it and ExxonMobil is likely to last for many years and will be a key part of ONGC’s ability to ensuring energy security for India.</p>
        <p>These long-term strategic energy partnerships between flagship Western oil companies and India are precisely what the U.S. had envisioned back in 2019 when it was putting together its ‘relationship normalisation deals’ initiative. This initiative had originated in the aftermath of the U.S.’s unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or colloquially, ‘the nuclear deal’) in May 2018, as analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets. From that point, Israel’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear program escalated and the U.S. knew that any major attack by Israel against Iran could well be a catalyst for a broader conflict across the entire Middle East. This, in turn, could eventually draw China and Russia as key sponsors of Iran into direct opposition to the US, a key sponsor of Israel. The U.S. also knew that several of its remaining allies in the Middle East shared Israel’s fear about Iranian intentions following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. In an attempt to counterbalance these fears, the administration under then-U.S. President Donald Trump came up with the relationship normalisation deals initiative. On 13 August 2020, it was announced that Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would normalise relations in a deal that had been brokered by the US – the first of the relationship normalisation deals program.</p>
        <p>For the program to work effectively for the long term, though, the U.S. needed a substitute big buyer of energy to China be found that could form a unified oil and gas supply and demand network with the US and its allies at the centre, rather than China and Russia. Both Beijing and Moscow were targeting the same countries as the U.S., with the exception of Iran, and had two significant advantages over the U.S. in attracting politically wavering Middle Eastern countries to their sphere of influence. First, Russia was the key player – alongside Saudi Arabia – in the ‘OPEC+’ oil supply alliance. Second, China was the big buyer in the global oil demand pool. Therefore, the U.S. posited, the substitute buyer for China had to be big and full of promise, and the obvious candidate was India.</p>
        <p>India’s role as the US counterpoint to China in the Indo-Pacific region was further underlined by data released in the first quarter of 2021 by the IEA. This showed that India would make up the biggest share of energy demand growth - at 25 percent - over the next two decades, as it overtook the European Union as the world’s third-biggest energy consumer by 2030. India’s energy consumption was expected to nearly double as the nation’s GDP expanded to an estimated USD8.6 trillion by 2040 under its national policy scenario. This was underpinned by a rate of GDP growth that added the equivalent of another Japan to the world economy by 2040, according to the IEA. Politically as well, there had been several developments – also analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets – that pointed to India finally making substantive progress on its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy as an alternative to China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative.</p>
        <p>The U.S.’s vision of the intertwining of the relationship normalisation deals initiative with the economic and political development of India was initially illustrated through an early series of major oil deals between the UAE and India. Perhaps the most notable of these was the landmark decision by India that allowed the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to export oil from the country’s vitally-important strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) if there was no domestic demand for it. This was in line with ADNOC being the only overseas company allowed to hold and store any part of India’s SPR. Another sign of the UAE and India developments moving in the way that the U.S. wanted for its ‘relationship normalisation deals’ model was ADNOC being put ‘top of the list’ of foreign companies being considered as the lead buyer in the high-profile privatisation of major Indian refiner, Bharat Petroleum. Russian state corporate proxy, Rosneft, had expressed an interest in buying the Indian government’s 53.29 percent stake in the company at that time but had been subsequently side-lined by ADNOC.</p>
        <p>Since then, and especially in light of India’s equivocal stance on Russia just before and after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, questions have remained on which way India will jump in the reordering of the global oil markets that is currently underway. However, with the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer, currently shipping in over 85% of its oil from overseas, India still remains in play as far as the West is concerned. The country is recovering economically from the effects of COVID-19 at a  slower pace than had been expected and is therefore looking to monetise its oil and gas resources as quickly as possible to minimise energy import costs. ExxonMobil’s prime position in several major sites and TotalEnergies’ new MoU have significantly bolstered the existing presence of Western firms in India to take advantage of this situation. September 2022 saw ONGC sign another agreement, with Chevron New Ventures (a subsidiary of U.S. energy giant, Chevron), to assess exploration potential in India. This deal is geared towards exploring the geologically challenging and difficult developments in Category-I, II and III of India’s sedimentary basins.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Despite ongoing market volatility and a sluggish start to 2023, the price of gold and silver continues to outperform on Wall Street while maintaining an upward trend towards historic highs.</p>
        <p>A Kitco News' online survey showed gold could top out at a record $2,100 an ounce in 2023, and silver could jump more than 50% to reach $38 an ounce this year. However, since Jan. 1, gold has only recorded modest gains, as silver backpedaled beneath the redline over the same time.</p>
        <p>The price of gold futures peaked at $2,014.90 on Monday before quickly retreating below the $2,000 marker, while silver continues to rally strong in recent weeks, rising roughly 4% the last month and another 3.1% the last week.</p>
        <p>In an interview with FOX Business, Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, said, "Both gold and silver added 15% to 20% over the last six months, while the overall market was in the range of 2% to 4% growth."</p>
        <p>"Things are just starting to heat up," he added. "In fact, the long-term projections in the precious metals market could get even higher."</p>
        <p>"And regardless of the Fed's position, few Americans have faith that the U.S. dollar will strengthen, providing a strong case for allocating a portion of funds to a tangible and secure asset," Rose added.</p>
        <p>Year-to-date, the U.S. dollar has slipped roughly 0.27% and is now just $0.93 of the euro and $0.82 of the pound sterling.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve will announce another interest rate decision on Wednesday, after the latest bump placed rates in the range of 4.5% to 4.75%, notching the highest mark since 2007 and the eighth consecutive increase.</p>
        <p>The interest rate hike in February followed a half-point jump in December and four 75-basis-point hikes earlier in 2022.</p>
        <p>Rose said in light of several major banking institutions failing over the last few weeks, "you now have the government and Fed claiming they can orchestrate a soft landing."</p>
        <p>"No one knows exactly what will happen in the future," he rebutted. "Historically speaking, you would be hard-pressed to find a more consistent option than precious metals to place your hard-earned money when the economy is crashing."</p>
        <p>According to Morgan Stanley, "The volatility of silver prices can be two to three times greater than that of gold on a given day," due to the silver market being much smaller than the yellow metal’s, resulting in lower market liquidity.</p>
        <p>However, silver’s increasing applications in industry could begin closing the gap in 2023, particularly as the automotive sector makes greater shifts to electric, and alternate forms of energy are harnessed through solar.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, gold remains the enduring metal on Wall Street because of its connection to currency alongside supply and demand factors, despite being primarily used in industry for its properties as a conductor in electronics manufacturing in both the aerospace and defense.</p>

        <p>Gold bugs have been waiting for this moment. The precious metal touched $2,000 an ounce on Monday amid a wobbly banking sector, elevated inflation, and expectations of a 25 basis point rate hike (or none at all) at the next Fed meeting.</p>
        <p>“When things get scary out there, investors run to safe havens, and gold is basically one of those major safe havens,” Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Inthemoneystocks.com and verifiedinvesting.com.</p>
        <p>Gold futures (GC=F) are up 6% since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the closure of Signature Bank of New York spurred concerns of a banking contagion. Europe’s Credit Suisse debacle also sent investors into assets like bitcoin and precious metals.</p>
        <p>“We have seen kind of a flee from the banking system," said Soloway. “Money absolutely did move away into gold and that’s definitely one of those fear-factor trades that has helped gold go higher."</p>
        <p>“Recent price gains have likely sapped some of the support for a further rally, even though the Fed is likely closer to their peak interest rate and the U.S. dollar may weaken further," Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle told Yahoo Finance. "That said, the trend is likely to remain higher, especially as demand from Asia recovers as China reopens this year."</p>
        <p>While gold bulls see the precious metal going past its previous record high of $2,074.88 some time before the end of 2023, the real fireworks are expected next year.</p>
        <p>“By 2024, I would actually say we’ll get well above $3,000, maybe $3500,” said Soloway, who expects prices to reach $2,100 by the end of this year. “2024 will be the big year for gold. That’s going to be the monster up year.”</p>
        <p>The future also looks bright for mining stocks, he said. Those underperformed last year as the costs to mine rose, but prices for the underlying metal did not.</p>
        <p>"We will see inflation that is somewhat lightly elevated, but it's not going to be at the levels that it was over the last year or so, and with gold really starting to play catchup, the miners are going to do really well over the next couple of years," said Soloway.</p>

        <p>Oil prices appear to have taken a break from focusing on macro events, with increasing demand and disruptions in supply pushing oil prices higher at the start of the week. The real news for oil markets this week, however, will come from the Fed's meeting.</p>
        <p>- As French strikes are moving into their third week and at least four refineries are winding down operations due to blocked ports and overflowing stocks, Europe’s diesel woes are making a counter-seasonal comeback.</p>
        <p>- French refining, recording 990,000 b/d in the last reported month of January 2023, is heavily geared towards diesel, but cannot meet the country’s hefty 850,000 b/d demand for the product.</p>
        <p>- Consequently, the spread between the prompt and second month of Europe’s diesel benchmark contract, the ICE low-sulfur diesel, rose to a premium of $35 per barrel, the highest since November 2022.</p>
        <p>- France might be the epicenter of the diesel squeeze because the blockage of import terminals across the country is limiting diesel importers from buying products, with diesel imports falling 50% this month compared to February.</p>
        <h3>Market Movers</h3>
        <p>- US LNG developer Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) has reached a final investment decision for the 13.5 mtpa capacity Phase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG project in Texas, estimating costs at $13 billion.</p>
        <p>- Italian oil major ENI (BIT:ENI) made a new 200 million-barrel discovery with its Yatzil exploration well in Mexico’s offshore Block 7, hitting 40m of net oil pay some 40 miles off the coast.</p>
        <p>- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) conglomerate sped up its pace of stock buybacks, having already repurchased more than $1.8 billion of its stock in 2023 to date, suggesting the company is still undervalued.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, March 21, 2023</p>
        <p>Having survived the macro mayhem of last week, oil prices have marginally rebounded this week, with ICE Brent climbing toward $75 per barrel again. The perennial bulls have started to discuss the commodity supercycle again, while the UN published yet another report of a “ticking climate bomb”. For a second it might even feel like a return to the idyllic past when only supply and demand mattered. However, that feeling will likely be a brief one as the Fed starts its two-day meeting on Tuesday, potentially creating another downside factor for prices.</p>
        <p><strong>US Oil Exports Hit Record Highs.</strong>US crude exports are set for an all-time high this month, with outflows to Europe averaging 2.1 million b/d so far as wide discounts for the WTI benchmark and a significantly lower domestic refining pull compel oil producers to export as much as they can.</p>
        <p><strong>G7 Holds Back on Price Cap Revision.</strong>The G7 group is reportedly not seeking to revise the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil this week, three months after it came into effect on December 05, claiming there is no appetite among the members to alter policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Gold Spikes to 1-Year High.</strong>Gold prices have spiked to their highest level since March 2022 this week on the back of banking collapses and a redirection of capital into safe-haven assets, hitting $2,009 per ounce in the Monday session, only to subside somewhat on</p>
        <p><strong>French Refinery Disruptions Get Worse.</strong>Four out of France’s six refineries, a total of 883,000 b/d of refining capacity, are poised to halt operations this week as nationwide protests against President Macron’s decision to increase the retirement age to 64 years spiral out of control.</p>
        <p><strong>Chevron Tanker Collides with Sanctioned Vessel.</strong>The Kerala oil tanker, chartered by US oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to transport some of its heavy Venezuelan crude at the Bajo Grande terminal, collided with Bueno, a sanctioned vessel that had carried Iranian oil in the past, in Venezuelan waters.</p>
        <p><strong>UK Oil Workers to Start Striking.</strong>Some 1,400 offshore workers brought together by the Unite trade union intend to strike across UK oil production sites within weeks, demanding better pay and work conditions, impacting output from fields operated by BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:SHEL), and others.</p>
        <p><strong>LME Suffers Another Scandal.</strong>Less than a year has passed since the LME’s nickel trading debacle, and the metal exchange has now found bags of stones instead of the nickel that was supposed to underpin some of its contracts at a warehouse in Rotterdam, dealing another blow to the 146-year-old exchange.</p>
        <p><strong>Indigenous Protests Hinder Ecuador Production.</strong>Protests by indigenous communities in Ecuador’s Oriente jungle have forced the country’s national oil firm Petroecuador to declare force majeure on production there, aggravated by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake that triggered power outages.</p>
        <p><strong>Mexico to Punish Its Own Refiner.</strong>The state authorities of the Nuevo Leon state in Mexico warned they would penalize national oil company Pemex for a dramatic increase in emissions coming out of its Cadereyta refinery, responsible for 90% of sulfur dioxide emissions in and around Monterrey.</p>
        <p><strong>BP Eyes Chinese CCUS Projects.</strong>UK energy major BP (NYSE:BP) signed an agreement with China’s state-owned oil company PetroChina (SHA:601857) to build a carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) cluster in the country’s Hainan province, potentially storing some 1 million tons CO2.</p>
        <p><strong>Exxon Wants to Get More Out of Mozambique.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong>Having shelved the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique after an Islamic State insurgency, US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is now looking to revive the project and increase its production capacity from the initial 15.2mtpa to 18mtpa.</p>
        <p><strong>Venezuelan Oil Minister Resigns.</strong>Venezuela’s oil minister Tareck El Aissami handed in his resignation this week after a corruption investigation into the operation of state oil company PDVSA by its new boss unearthed serious acts of corruption, linked to the disappearance of $3-5 billion in cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p><strong>EU Wants to Extend Gas Cut Mandates.</strong>The European Commission proposed an extension of gas consumption mandates for EU member states to have gas demand cut by 15% for another 12 months, wary that natural gas markets remain tight despite the exceptionally warm winter.</p>

        <p>High inflation, a banking crisis, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions; it’s no wonder gold is finding a bid. Is this rally going to fade or is it signal of what is to come?</p>
        <p>Gold is a bit of an oddball asset and is shrouded by conspiracy and half-truths. While commonly regarded as an inflation hedge, it doesn’t actually correlate very well with the rate of inflation. In 2022, we saw that during the worst bout of inflation in 50 years, gold prices were unchanged over the year. Nonetheless, gold has continuously grinded higher over the last two decades in line with the expansion of central bank balance sheets.</p>
        <p>Gold, while not a great stand-alone investment can provide some valuable portfolio diversification. Its returns are generally quite lumpy, but often provides standout performance during periods of very high market stress.</p>
        <h3>Technical Setup</h3>
        <p>A long-term price chart of gold futures shows a compelling technical chart pattern has developed over the last 10 years. A prototypical cup and handle pattern indicates there may be more room to run for the yellow metal.</p>
        <p>A monthly close above $2000 signals a breakout that can extend to $2400, although a reversal back into the range would invalidate the setup.</p>
        <h3>Barrick Gold</h3>
        <p>Barrick Gold GOLD, based in Toronto, Canada, is the largest gold mining company in the world. GOLD has many advanced exploration and development projects located across five continents. The company produced 4.1 million ounces of gold in 2022 and has 76 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.</p>
        <p>Barrick Gold currently earns a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a mixed earnings revision trend. We can see that the current and next quarter have seen some small revisions lower, but the current year and next year are looking higher. Furthermore, the major factor determining Barrick’s returns are going to be the price of gold. Thus, if we see continued strength in gold prices, Barrick should follow.</p>
        <p>So far this year Barrick Gold is up 8% and trading in line with the underlying commodity. Over the last year GOLD stock is down -22% considerably underperforming gold.</p>
        <p>GOLD is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 20x, which is below the industry average of 22x and below its own five-year median of 21x. Additionally, Barrick Gold has a dividend yield of 2.3%, and has raised its dividend an average of 30% annually over the last five years. Barrick Gold’s dividend yield can make the stock more compelling than the underlying commodity because gold has no cash flow.</p>
        <h3>Yamana Gold</h3>
        <p>Yamana Gold AUY is another Canada based gold producer. It operates both gold and copper exploration and development sites in North America, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years Yamana Gold stock has performed quite well, outperforming both its respective industry and the broad market. AUY also offers a dividend yield of 2%, which it has increased by an average of 44% annually over the last three years.</p>
        <p>AUY boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Over the last 60 days analysts have raised earnings expectations for all future earnings periods.</p>
        <p>The company’s EPS surprised to the upside by 25% last quarter. Additionally, AUY has a history of beating earnings expectations having missed only once over the last five years.</p>
        <p>Currently trading at 19x one-year forward earnings AUY is above its three-year median of 17x, and below the industry average of 22x.</p>
        <h3>Additional Picks</h3>
        <p>There are two additional options for adding exposure to gold. The first is through the most popular gold ETF GLD, which does a good job of tracking the underlying price of gold.</p>
        <p>The second option is the gold miners ETF GDX. This ETF holds a portfolio of gold mining companies like the ones featured here. GDX is generally more volatile than the underlying commodity, which can be great if you time it correctly with a rally, or painful if the timing is poor.</p>
        <p>With Gold breaking out above $2000 there is no doubt that we are going through unprecedented times. Even if you aren’t trading gold as it stands now, at the least it can be used as an indication of the state of capital markets. If investors are reaching for gold, you can assume uncertainty is on the rise.</p>

        <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices retreated from their highest level in a year in volatile trading on Monday, as share markets and Treasury yields bounced back on central banks' efforts to shore up confidence in the financial sector.</p>
        <p>Spot gold dipped 0.5% to $1,977.18 per ounce by 1:57 p.m. EDT (1757 GMT), after sliding over 1%, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to settle at $1,982.80.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the session, prices of the yellow metal had climbed 1% to their highest since March 2022 at $2,009.59, just shy of a record set during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>"While emergency efforts are being done... now you're seeing that this is far from over. Safe-haven flows are fairly going to be the key trade," Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said.</p>
        <p>In an effort to help the banking sector, top central banks moved on Sunday to bolster the flow of cash around the world.</p>
        <p>Benchmark Treasury yields rose close to their session highs, while equities bounced back on the rescue of Credit Suisse which helped calm some jitters around a bigger banking crisis. [.N] [US/]</p>
        <p>Gold prices have rallied more than $100 after the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month.</p>
        <p>"Today's rejection above $2,000 may trigger some profit-taking, but in our opinion not a change in direction," Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note, adding he maintains a bullish outlook on gold.</p>
        <p>Bullion is considered a safe-haven asset during financial uncertainty, and lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding bullion, making it more attractive.</p>
        <p>A key U.S. central bank policy announcement is due on Wednesday. Market participants are mixed on the Federal Reserve's decision, while bets for a rate-hike pause have increased.</p>
        <p>Spot silver fell 0.4% to $22.50 per ounce, platinum firmed 1.1% at $986.27, and palladium dipped 0.5% to $1,413.08.</p>

        <p>As such, gold ETF rallied over the last week with GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR, iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Strategy ETF IAUF, and Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF SGOL gaining about 5% each.</p>
        <h3>Factors Driving Gold Price</h3>
        <p>The combination of factors is acting as a catalyst for gold price. Wall Street has been witnessing high volatility lately due to failures of regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank. While First Republic Bank secured a $30 billion rescue package from other big banks, its fate is still unclear.</p>
        <p>The crisis spread to the global market. And European banking behemoth Credit Suisse is also operating at the edge. The flagship Swiss lender's shares nosedived on fears of a debt default. Finally, UBS has purchased the struggling Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in a historic deal. Such crisis has every reason for a flight to safety, which has bolstered the demand for safe haven asset gold.</p>
        <p>In fact, other safe assets like U.S. treasuries gained too, dragging down bond yields. As U.S. treasury yields dropped last week, the greenback has lost its strength. The U.S. benchmark treasury yield started the month at 4.01%, hit a high of 4.08% and ended last week at 3.39%. Traders expect the Fed to raise its benchmark lending rate this week but by a smaller margin of a 25 bps. A decline in bond yields went in favor of non-interest-paying assets like gold.</p>
        <p>If the pace of Fed rate hike slows, the U.S. dollar is likely to decline ahead. If the greenback falls, gold prices will gain as the metal is priced in the U.S. dollar. Moreover, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the East Europe and tensed relationship between United States and China may boost the safe-haven status of gold.</p>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>The gold’s rally from here depends on the Fed’s behavior and the government’s ability to tackle the banking crisis. If the U.S. economic growth slows materially, jobs market suffers and the banking crisis deepens, the Fed will likely be staying put in the coming months. This would be a good new for gold investing. Gold investors should closely watch the economic and market events before taking any decision.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Gold slipped after earlier rising above $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year as a deal to buy Credit Suisse Group AG failed to fully ease fears over the global banking sector.</p>
        <p>The haven earlier rose as much as 1% despite regulators worldwide rushing to shore up market confidence over the weekend. The ongoing banking woes are also spurring bets that central banks may embark on a slower pace of monetary tightening.</p>
        <p>Read More: UBS to Buy Credit Suisse in $3 Billion Deal to Fight Crisis</p>
        <p>Bullion surged 6.5% last week in its biggest advance since early on in the pandemic after several regional American lenders collapsed and concerns grew over the Swiss bank’s health.</p>
        <p>“The treatment of AT1 bonds has introduced a new source of uncertainty,” Marcus Garvey, head of metals strategy at Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note. “The longer uncertainty rolls on, with neither market fears being wholly calmed nor a full-blown systematic crisis unfolding, the higher gold prices should be able to trade.”</p>
        <p>It’s a sharp turnaround for bullion, which slid last month on expectations the Federal Reserve would continue its aggressive monetary tightening to curb inflation. Those bets have since been greatly diminished, with swaps traders now split on whether the central bank will hike again this year.</p>
        <p>That’s a boon for non-yielding gold, and investors have responded by increasing their allocations to the market. In tonnage terms, exchange-traded fund holdings of the metal rose the most since April last week, according to an initial tally by Bloomberg.</p>
        <p>All eyes will now shift to the Fed’s two-day meeting that culminates Wednesday, “where the outcome is going to be the most difficult to predict in years,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. A shift to a more dovish outlook from policymakers at a time when inflation remains hot could push gold even higher.</p>
        <p>Spot gold fell 0.5% to $1,978.64 an ounce as of 12:20 p.m. in New York, after earlier climbing as high as $2,009.73. The last time bullion traded above the $2,000 mark was in March 2022. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was 0.4% lower. Silver and palladium dropped, while platinum gained.</p>
        <p>Copper traded on the London Metal Exchange advanced as risk appetite improved moderately. Most other base metals were higher.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Many commodities remained under pressure in the wake of UBS Group AG’s emergency purchase of Credit Suisse Group AG that aims to contain a banking crisis hurting the appeal of risk assets.</p>
        <p>Oil sank, with the US benchmark plunging below $65 a barrel to the lowest since late 2021. Grains fell and European gas hit the lowest in more than 1 1/2 years, though copper rose amid a mixed session for industrial metals. Gold — which benefited from the banking turmoil with a 6.5% surge last week — eased after topping $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year on haven demand.</p>
        <p>After reaching a record last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Bloomberg Commodities Spot Index has dropped by more than a quarter as concerns over a global slowdown, higher interest rates, and a huge selloff in natural gas dragged the gauge lower. The upheaval in the banking sector — marked by the swift collapse of several US lenders and subsequent crisis at Credit Suisse — then deepened the rout, although bullion was a beneficiary.</p>
        <p>With a crisis of confidence threatening to spread across financial markets, the Swiss government brokered the deal for Credit Suisse over the weekend, including a guarantee for potential losses from the assets UBS is taking over. The Federal Reserve and five other central banks also announced coordinated action to boost liquidity in US dollar swap arrangements to ease strains in the financial system.</p>
        <p>Following those efforts, financial markets came under further pressure early Monday before equities started to fare better.</p>
        <p>“When banking suffers then credit suffers and then the economy suffers,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB. “So less optimism on economic growth is warranted.”</p>
        <p>The trajectory for raw materials this week will mostly hinge on how the Credit Suisse deal is received, as well as on the outcome of the Fed’s rate decision on Wednesday. Although US policy makers had signaled their willingness to raise rates by 50 basis points to contain still-hot inflation before the banking crisis erupted, market watchers now expect a smaller increase, or perhaps even a pause.</p>
        <p>The worries over the banking sector have prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — one of the most bullish banks on crude — to trim its forecasts, with the lender no longer seeing prices at $100 in the year ahead. That’s even with it now expecting OPEC producers to only increase output in the third quarter of 2024, rather than in the second half of 2023.</p>
        <p>Oil Spread Slumps Most Since January in Latest Sign of Weakness</p>
        <p>“Participants are still not fully convinced on whether recent moves by authorities can backstop further banking fallouts,” said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte in Singapore. Investors are now wondering whether to buy the dip, Yeap said.</p>
        <p>Bullion’s Appeal</p>
        <p>Gold’s jump last week was its biggest since the early days of the pandemic. Heading into the latest banking crisis, precious metals were dramatically under-owned after a big selloff in February, said Ole Sloth Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. A shift to a more dovish outlook from Fed policy makers would benefit non-yielding bullion.</p>
        <p>In other commodities, iron ore fell after Chinese regulators renewed warnings to companies against hoarding and price gouging in response to a recent surge in the steel-making material. Wheat retreated after the renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to ship rains and other crops from key Black Sea ports, although there was uncertainty over the length of the agreement.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Global coal consumption will likely peak by next year as economics and climate strategies shift the world toward cleaner energy, but several wild cards could determine how long the dirtiest fossil fuel persists, according to BloombergNEF.</p>
        <p>Coal power generation increased in each of the past two years as China and India battled electricity shortages and Europe tried to replace Russian natural gas. BNEF modeled two scenarios — a purely economic one and one driven by policies to reach net zero emissions by 2050 — both of which see demand rise to a record next year before declining.</p>
        <p>Under both scenarios there are several wild cards that could affect how slowly or rapidly use of the fossil fuel declines. These include stronger-than-expected power demand, social backlash against the loss of mining jobs and lobbying from plant owners. China’s clean energy policies, economic support for poorer nations’ energy transitions and prices are other key factors.</p>
        <p>BloombergNEF sees coal use persisting through the middle of the century even under strong net zero policies, where demand in the power sector would fall about 70% from its 2024 peak to 1.5 billion tons a year and require plants equipped with carbon capture systems to keep emissions at bay. That would require massive investments in the technology, which has struggled to prove it can operate commercially at scale.</p>
        <p>Coal production has outpaced demand over the past two years, as top miners China and India lifted output to help battle power shortages. That led to a surge in inventories by the end of 2022, especially in China.</p>
        <p>The report also highlights a rocky road ahead for the seaborne thermal coal trade. While production increased for domestic use in China and India, miners in exporters including Australia and the US have ramped down investments to avoid being stuck with stranded assets. That could create a supply squeeze if demand in importing countries rises.</p>
        <p>“A supply crunch in the seaborne thermal coal market could raise coal prices and make it less competitive in the power sector in coal-importing countries and hence accelerate the fall of coal consumption around the world,” BloombergNEF said in the report.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p><strong>Southern Copper Corporation</strong>SCCO is poised well for growth, backed by its industry-leading copper reserves, focus on increasing low-cost production and ongoing investment in expansion projects. Its cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.</p>
        <h3>Output to Pick Up 2023 Onwards</h3>
        <p>In 2022, the company registered a 6.6% year-over-year decline in copper production to 894,703 tons, due to work stoppage at the Cuajone mine as well as lower ore grades. Molybdenum production was 13.3% down to 26,240 tons as a result of lower ore grades at the Toquepala mine. Zinc production was down 10.4% year over year to 60,010 tons due to lower production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara mines. Mined silver production was 18.56 million ounces, down 2.1% from last year. This was mainly due to a decline in production at Peruvian operations and the La Caridad mine which was partially offset by higher production at Buenavista and IMMSA mines.</p>
        <p>These numbers are expected to pick up and reach 926,000 tons in 2023. This will be made possible by the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production on projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrators.</p>
        <h3>Solid Projects on Track</h3>
        <p>Southern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion, including the Michiquillay ($2.5 billion) and Los Chancas ($2.6 billion) projects. Peru is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. Production is expected to commence by 2032.</p>
        <p>The Los Chancas project located in Apurimac, Peru is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of the concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The project is expected to commence in 2030.</p>
        <p>The company has a number of other projects that are planned to be developed in the future, which will help in attaining its copper volume production target of 1.5 million tons by 2031.</p>
        <h3>Metal Prices to Pick Up in the Long Term</h3>
        <p>Copper prices had been on a downtrend in 2022 amid uncertainties surrounding the global economy, as new coronavirus restrictions in China affected the demand for the red metal, thus hurting prices. Zinc prices also bore the brunt of weak demand worries as COVID lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Silver prices had also been negatively impacted, weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth.</p>
        <p>Industrial production in China has lagged expectations for the first two months of this year while political unrest in South America is fueling supply concerns. This has been weighing on copper prices lately.</p>
        <p>The long-term outlook for copper is positive, as copper demand is expected to grow, driven by electric vehicles and renewable energy, and infrastructure investments. Copper prices will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States, as well as global initiatives to address climate change.</p>
        <p>Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand and reduced supply. Long-term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption. Silver prices will gain eventually, given its industrial use, impending demand-supply imbalance and safe-haven demand.</p>
        <h3>Industry Leading Reserves & Low Cost: A Winning Combination</h3>
        <p>Southern Copper has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates high-quality, world-class assets in investment-grade countries such as Mexico and Peru. Backed by its constant focus on increasing low-cost production and growth investments, the company is well-poised to continue delivering enhanced performance. Its efforts to lower costs have aided the company to negate the impacts of higher costs for diesel and fuel, operating and repair materials, supplies and energy, as well as higher labor costs.</p>
        <h3>Price Performance</h3>
        <p>The company’s shares have fallen 2.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s 14% growth.</p>
        <h3>Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider</h3>
        <p>Southern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
        <p>Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, Olympic Steel Inc. ZEUS and Nucor Corporation NUE.</p>
        <p>Steel Dynamics currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). STLD’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 11.3% on average. STLD has rallied around 23.2% in a year.</p>
        <p>Olympic Steel currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. ZEUS’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 26.2% on average. ZEUS has rallied around 51.7% in a year.</p>
        <p>Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). NUE’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 7.7% on average. NUE has rallied around 20.5% in a year.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>In the case of OPEC, cutting back on oil supplies doesn't do much for boosting prices when demand isn't there.</p>
        <p>The OPEC put, just like the Fed put, is nothing other than a fallacy, or perhaps wishful thinking at this point. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Brent oil spiked to $130 a barrel plus, money rushed into the oil sector as we heard doom-and-gloom calls about a lack of energy capital spending, running out of spare capacity, and how oil prices would need to be higher for longer to spur that investment.</p>
        <p>True as some of those calls may be, commodities don't work that way. They are driven by actual demand and supply at any given time and by the inventory balance. Of course, academics and analysts tend to move their models at extremes to price in the latest scenario. But trading does not care about research-driven models. After all, if we believed research-driven models, Tesla (TSLA) was supposed to trade at $1.500.</p>
        <p>It is easy to tweak an Excel model to spit out whatever confirmation bias you may have, or play with the denominator to generate the result one wants to see. Assumptions are very important in any modeling, and that is where the problem lies. Most models get demand entirely wrong.</p>
        <p>After the rout in technology stocks in 2022, most investors parked their money in what they deemed as safe haven assets, such as large-cap equites that showed 4%-5% yield on their balance sheets. But those very same dividend yields are subject to cash flows, and if the top line erodes, so do those cash flows. A stock needs to give an investor the right upside reward potential for the risk the investor takes to invest in that equity. But if US government bonds yielded the same coupon as a risky equity, one would be better suited to be invested in the former.</p>
        <p>Just as we saw in natural gas markets when prices got to as high as 300 euros per megawatt hour and most called for Europe to be sent back to the dark ages, lo and behold, the physical market finds a way as there are entrepreneurs who will find a way to capitalize on these arbitrage opportunities. US liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies did just that as they profited from the massive $10/MMBtu vs. $2/MMBtu differential by sending all their cargoes to Europe as Europe was desperate.</p>
        <p>European gas today is trading below 45 euros per MWh and politicians are still debating energy and gas security. The oil market is slightly different in that we have had OPEC and Russia working together to balance the market, supporting prices so to speak. This only works when the market is tight and you are the only swing producer, i.e. in 2021. But today, demand is not as strong despite China reopening its economy, and there is no need for additional barrels. When demand is weak and supply picks up, there is nothing much that can be done to support prices.</p>
        <p>Oil equity investors held onto their long oil bets all throughout 2022 as they hoped for China's return or Russian barrels to come off the market. Neither has happened. Oil prices are down 50%-plus as analysts who assumed $90 a barrel was the floor for oil are seeing less than $75 a barrel now. One forgets that we were trading below $75 a barrel before Covid.</p>
        <p>The same wishful thinking is heard in the equity market as most retail investors think Fed will come to their rescue as it did in the past decade and start quantitative easing (QE) again. But what the Fed and OPEC have in common is that they never had to deal with a harsh recession and higher inflation at the same time. Both have their hands tied for now, for if they were to either print more money (in the case of Fed) or cut back on supplies (OPEC), it could cause a price surge, but only in the short term, as that would collapse the global economy as we know it, sending it back even worse than the 1970s.</p>

        <p>HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. is considering selling its majority stake in the Rovigo LNG terminal offshore Italy as part of a strategy to divest from non-core assets, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The terminal, also named, Adriatic LNG, is owned by Exxon's subsidiary ExxonMobil Italiana Gas S.r.l. (70.7%), QatarEnergy subsidiary Qatar Terminal Company Limited (22%) and Snam Spa (7.3%). Snam has the right of first refusal should a partner decide to divest.</p>
        <p>Exxon said that while it was verifying market interest, it had not made a decision about a potential sale nor has it identified a buyer at this early stage.</p>
        <p>"Tests like this are consistent with our focused investment strategy, highlighting our willingness to divest non-core assets to those who can derive greater value," Exxon spokesperson Meghan Macdonald said.</p>
        <p>Any transaction would not impact Exxon's imports of LNG into the Adriatic LNG terminal, nor its interest in the Italian and European markets as a natural gas supplier, the company said.</p>

        <p>The announcement comes alongside remarks from European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson, directing European companies not to enter any new LNG trade deals with Russia, as the continent tries to completely shed Russian energy exports by 2027.</p>
        <p>"I encourage all member states and all companies to stop buying Russian LNG, and not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia once the existing contracts have expired," she said in an EU meeting on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago sparked an energy war as Russia cut off its gas and oil exports to the continent in retaliation for Western sanctions.</p>
        <p>Though the bloc weathered the crisis thanks to a mild winter and increased imports from alternative suppliers, such as the US, it continues to depend on Russian LNG, and imports of the commodity increased by 35% in 2022.</p>
        <p>"We can and should get rid of Russian gas completely as soon as possible, still keeping in mind our security of supply," Simson said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the EU has continued to develop on-sea floating import terminals, or FSRUs, that have allowed it to import LNG from new suppliers without the construction of pipelines.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Shell Plc SHEL, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, has recently withdrawn its involvement in the Salym Petroleum Development in Russia. This marks a significant moment in the company's history, as it has been operating in the region for over two decades.</p>
        <p>The decision to exit the Salym project was made as part of Shell's ongoing strategy to streamline its global portfolio and focus on areas where it can generate maximum returns.</p>
        <p>The company has been divesting its non-core assets and reducing costs in recent years, in order to become more competitive and adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
        <p>Salym Petroleum Development was a joint venture between Shell and Gazprom Neft, with the former holding a 50% interest in the project. The venture was launched in 1996 to develop oil fields in the West Siberian Basin and has since produced over 200 million barrels of oil.</p>
        <p>Despite its success, the Salym project was not considered a strategic asset for Shell, and the decision to divest was made after a comprehensive review of the company's portfolio. The withdrawal was completed on Dec 22, 2022, and the stake was sold to Gazprom Neft for $233 million.</p>
        <p>While the sale of the Salym stake will have a limited impact on Shell's overall production, it is an important step in the company's efforts to simplify its portfolio and focus on areas of higher revenue generation. Shell is currently investing in a range of new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energy and electric vehicle charging, as it seeks transition to a low-carbon future.</p>
        <p>The withdrawal from the Salym project also reflects the broader trend of international oil companies reducing their exposure to Russia, due to political and economic risks. Sanctions imposed by Western countries in response to Russia's Ukraine invasion in 2022 have made it more difficult for foreign companies to do business in the country.</p>
        <p>The withdrawal is also a clear indication of the company's commitment to strategic focus and adaptability in a changing industry. As the energy transition accelerates, companies will need to be proactive in adapting to the new energy landscape.</p>
        <p>Shell, a multinational energy and petrochemical company, headquartered in London, engages in the exploration, extraction, marketing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also produces gas-to-liquid fuels and other products.</p>
