    	<p>It's been brutal week for oil prices, despite a Friday rebound. Slides in earlier sessions led crude futures to close out their third straight week of losses.</p>
    	<p>The S&P 500 Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE) also rebounded during Friday's trading day, yet it ended the week down 5.7%.</p>	
    	<p>Recession fears drove much of the the downward movement in prior sessions. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points. The move is expected to further press the brakes on the economy.</p>	
    	<p>This week's slide played out in tandem with the regional banking turmoil. As regional banks came under pressure, oil prices tanked.</p>
      <p>"If we get a debacle in the financial markets, it will definitely have collateral damage in oil," OPIS global head of energy analysis Tom Kloza recently told Yahoo Finance Live.</p>
      <p>"Energy price movements are consistent with rising market expectations for a recession," Will Compernolle, FHN Macro Strategist wrote in a note to investors this week.</p>
      <p>The EIA’s recently released Weekly petroleum Status Report showed declining demand for gasoline and jet fuel in the week ending April 28th.</p>
      <p>While China reopening is expected to be a positive for oil, the demand hasn't been linear. China factory activity unexpectedly cooled in April, reducing demand expectations.</p>
      <p>"I think from a demand side perspective, the Chinese story from an industrial capacity perspective is still to play out throughout the year," Murray Auchincloss, chief financial officer of BP (BP), said during the energy giant's earnings call earlier this week.</p>
      <p>"It's why we are constructive on oil prices looking out through the rest of the year," he added.</p>
      <p>On Friday, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) rose 4.1% while Brent (BZ=F) crude gained 3.9%. WTI and Brent closed out the week with a decline of 7.1% and 5.3% respectively.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Crude markets have suffered a disastrous few weeks, dragged down by alarm over the wider economy. But real oil demand still looks strong enough to foster a rebound in prices.</p>
    	<p>International benchmark Brent almost dropped to $70 a barrel on Thursday after losing 17% since mid-April on fears of a US recession and signs of a disappointing recovery in China. Crude in New York plunged at the open to take the decline over the past three weeks to $20, before recovering.</p>	
    	<p>Nonetheless, there are signs the underlying oil market is resilient. China is sucking in a flood of cargoes as domestic travel rebounds, and traders expect the country’s crude purchases to remain high in the next few months. Inventories are tightening around the world, and should deplete even faster as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies implement new supply cutbacks.</p>	
      <p>That’s reassuring even some of the industry’s most bearish forecasters a supply deficit is coming which will trigger a recovery in prices.</p>
      <p>“The selloff was far greater than what market balances are showing — namely lower inventories with the prospect of inventory draws as the northern hemisphere’s summer unfolds,” said Ed Morse at Citigroup Inc. The bank has held one of the most cautious price outlooks on Wall Street this year.</p>
      <p>Crude’s retreat offers some respite for consumers after the inflationary shock inflicted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It also brings pain for bullish oil traders, and puts in peril the windfall being reaped by major oil companies and producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Iraq.</p>
      <p>Refinery Demand</p>
      <p>The pullback in crude markets began with fundamentals.</p>
      <p>Buying by refineries in Asia was subdued in April as margins for making fuels dipped. In a nod to some of that weakness, Saudi Arabia cut its oil prices for Asian processors for June on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, supplies from top exporter Russia have remained stubbornly high despite Moscow’s threats to slash output in retaliation for sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The market was faltering and Morgan Stanley — once at the forefront of calls for $100-a-barrel — on Tuesday abandoned projections for any substantial rally this year.</p>
      <p>The big drop-off came with worries over the economy and persistent trouble with banks that rippled through markets everywhere. Short-sellers have crept back into the market for the first time since the Saudi-led OPEC+ alliance unveiled new production curbs in early April.</p>
      <p>But oil consumption continues to appear healthy and may even rise further over the coming months, according to UBS Group AG, which advised clients in a note on Thursday to add long positions in Brent. The physical market, where actual oil is traded, remains strong and supply is “pretty tight,” Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Brent futures have started to retrace some of their losses, gaining as much as 1.9% on Friday to trade above $73 a barrel in London. The market’s strength is reflected across the pricing structure, with Brent futures for immediate delivery commanding a premium over later months in a curve known as backwardation.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anything has changed fundamentally,” said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered Bank. Instead, these are “perfect conditions to be driven by top-down macro and momentum trading.”</p>
      <p>China Indicators</p>
      <p>While traders are still waiting to see how much crude Asia buys this month for further clues on demand, China is attracting cargoes as it emerges from its restrictive Covid rules. Flights in the country surged over the five-day Labor Day holidays with 9.42 million air passenger trips — an increase of 4.2% over the same period in 2019.</p>
      <p>World oil use too remains on track to climb by a healthy 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.</p>
    	<p>World oil use too remains on track to climb by a healthy 2 million barrels a day this year to a record 101.9 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.</p>
      <p>“For now, the oil market remains mired in a wall of recessionary worry,” Helima Croft, chief commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. But “OPEC remains fully committed to trying to midwife a recovery.”</p>
      <p>The latest slump in crude, coming just days into the output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been a warning light for the group and its partners. They will gather in person for their next monthly meeting for a detailed review of market trends.</p>
      <p>“The OPEC cuts should help mitigate” the bearish market backdrop, said Christyan Malek, head of energy strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “OPEC’s role as central bank for energy couldn’t come at a more critical time.”</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>A combination of negative economic data and thin trading in oil markets led to a sharp drop in crude prices Tuesday.</p>
    	<h3>What happened</h3>
      <p>Shares of oil and natural gas majors Chevron (CVX -4.30%), ExxonMobil (XOM -3.98%), and Petrobras (PBR -3.71%) were falling Tuesday, dropping significantly before recovering somewhat to declines of 4.6%, 3.8%, and 3.4%, respectively, as of 2:30 p.m. ET.</p>	
    	<p>Oil and natural gas businesses are quite sensitive to economic data, and several reports released Tuesday and earlier this week pointed to the likelihood of a global economic slowdown. In addition, the ongoing turmoil in U.S. regional banks threatens to slow lending and economic activity. Finally, holidays in Asia and the United Kingdom on Tuesday resulted in thinner-than-usual trading, which may have exacerbated the downward moves in crude prices.</p>	
    	<h3>So what</h3>
      <p>On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department's March Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) came in weaker than expected, following on the heels of a manufacturing data report Monday that was similarly below expectations.</p>
      <p>Job openings came in at 9.59 million in March, down from 9.97 million in February and below the consensus estimate of 9.64 million. The number of layoffs and discharges also grew more than expected to a figure equal to 1.2% of the labor force, up from 1% in February. Of note, there were still about 1.6 job openings for every unemployed person. That's a tight labor market, but not as tight as in February, when there were 1.9 openings per unemployed person. And for much of 2021 and 2022, there were around 2 openings per unemployed person.</p>
      <p>Also, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. orders for manufactured goods rose 0.9% month-over-month in March after two straight months of declines, but that was lower than the 1.1% gain expected. In addition, the February manufacturing result was revised down from a 0.8% decline to a 1.1% decline.</p>
      <p>Weak economic data are running up against another event that could tighten financial conditions even further. The Federal Open Market Committee started its two-day meeting Tuesday, and it's expected that it will raise the federal funds rate by another 25 basis points Wednesday, although that's not a certainty. Last week, rate futures suggested about a 90% chance of another 25-basis-point hike.</p>
      <p>The potential for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates into a weakening economic picture caused oil prices to plunge Tuesday. That followed a decline on Monday, when Chinese manufacturing data came in weaker than expected. Meanwhile, Iran announced it had actually grown its production to over 3 million barrels per day, which added incremental supply in a market dominated by demand fears.</p>
      <p>Finally, exacerbating the decline in oil prices Tuesday was a lack of trading activity in the U.K. and Asia due to holidays. Thin volume and a lack of liquidity can enhance price moves in either direction.</p>
      <p>Basically, the messy macroeconomic picture pushed oil prices down by about 5% to their lowest levels since December. In that light, it's no surprise that even diversified majors fell too. Smaller oil and natural gas companies slid even more.</p>
      <h3>Now what</h3>
      <p>Both ExxonMobil and Chevron recently reported first-quarter numbers that beat analysts' consensus estimates, but as huge global oil and gas companies, they can't really escape the macroeconomic situation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Petrobras has been performing well, but it has been under pressure for other reasons. The partially state-owned oil company just elected a new board of directors that will likely pivot it toward a more liberal policy stance favored by Brazil's new president, Lula da Silva, who backs price controls, environmental preservation, and investments in renewable energy. On Monday, a Brazilian environmental agency recommended against approving Petrobras' plans to drill near the mouth of the Amazon River. Perhaps because Petrobras' stock price had already declined significantly since Brazil's presidential election in the fall, it didn't fall by as much Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Oil and natural gas companies would no doubt come under pressure in a recession, but they do trade at low multiples today. Investors who hold these stocks not only benefit from their dividends, but also can profit during supply shocks like those that occurred last year. However, it appears as though demand worries are the problem of the day now, and likely will be in the months ahead.</p>

    	<p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil fell on Monday as concern over the economic impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve potentially raising interest rates and weaker Chinese manufacturing data outweighed support from OPEC+ supply cuts taking effect this month.</p>
    	<p>The Fed, which meets on May 2-3, is expected to increase interest rates by another 25 basis points. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Monday, making oil more expensive for other currency holders.</p>	
    	<p>Brent crude fell 97 cents, or 1.2%, to $79.36 a barrel by 1342 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slid $1.44, or 1.9%, to trade at $75.34.</p>	
    	<p>"The failure to reach more solid ground above $80.50 in Brent points to continued selling interest amid the well known growth/demand concerns," said Ole Hansen, head of commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank.</p>
      <p>Banking fears have weighed on oil in recent weeks and in what is the third major U.S. institution to fail in two months, United States regulators said on Monday First Republic Bank has been seized and a deal agreed to sell the bank to JPMorgan.</p>
      <p>"Investors are afraid that if the Fed continues to raise interest rates as expected, what will happen to the U.S. financial system's other problem children?," said Naeem Aslam of Zaye Capital Markets, who added a hike of at least 25 basis points this week was still expected.</p>
      <p>Weak economic data from China was also in focus. China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) declined to 49.2 from 51.9 in March, slipping below the 50-point mark that separates expansion and contraction in activity on a monthly basis.</p>
      <p>Some support came from voluntary output cuts of around 1.16 million barrels per day by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, which take effect from May.</p>
      <p>"We believe the oil market will be in deficit through the remainder of the second quarter" following the OPEC+ cuts, said Baden Moore, head of commodity and carbon strategy at National Australia Bank.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil recouped some of last week’s slump in lower-volume trading as many investors took a pause while awaiting further clues to demand.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate rose to trade near $79 a barrel, swinging in a $2.50 range during a volatile session throughout the day. Last week, the commodity experienced the biggest weekly drop since the banking crisis in March amid signs of shrinking refining margins in Asia.</p>	
        <p>“There are a lot of traders sitting on the sidelines trying to figure out a direction,” said Carley Garner a Commodity Broker and Strategist at DeCarley Trading. “Traders are looking for a dip to get into; if we hold $75, we can start making a way higher.”</p>	
        <p>Crude has wiped out nearly all of the rally seen earlier this month after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced surprise new production cuts. Citigroup Inc. said it was taken aback by the magnitude of the pullback in Asian refining margins, which is partly attributable to the ramp up of new Middle Eastern refineries.</p>
        <p>Later this week, the Federal Reserve will release the last of its major reports on US jobs, inflation and consumer spending before its May policy meeting. Additionally, some of the world’s biggest oil majors, including Chevron and Exxon, will report their first-quarter earnings on Friday.</p>

        <p>The tide appears to have turned, just as it did at the crucial moment in 2008. And just like it was the case back then, it seems that most people missed it.</p>
        <p>The thing is that people are usually concerned with very short-term news and price moves:</p>	
        <p>- Gold rallied by $X, yesterday!</p>	
        <p>- Rates were just hiked by x%!</p>
        <p>And so on…</p>
        <p>In reality, these events are just triggers for events that are unfolding in tune with long-term trends and analogies. Some of those triggers make perfect sense, and some don’t, as markets can act in the “buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact” mode, thus greatly perplexing those, who expect the market moves to always be in tune with the news that was just announced.</p>
        <p>Boy, were those folks surprised when the rates were cut by 0.75% back in 2008 and the stock market still plunged!</p>
        <p>There are myriads of such examples, and examining them leads to one major take-away. Even though it might seem exciting and very important to focus on those immediate-term events, it is actually the analysis of trends, technicals, and analogies to the previous situations that actually brings useful insights that can then help one make profitable trades. Of course, no technique is perfect, and nobody, including yours truly, can guarantee any kind of performance, but based on two decades of my experience in the precious metals market, I see how useful this is, especially compared to any attempts to guess what the next “unexpected news” is going to be (hint: even if it happens as one had thought, it sometimes has a different effect than one had expected).</p>
        <p>When forecasting gold prices, it’s no different. Focusing on the big picture comes first, and spotting analogies to what already happened is second. Trying to guesstimate what’s about to take place in the news is much further on the list.</p>
        <p>The space here is limited (and so is everyone’s time), so to make a long story short, the big picture for gold is not as bullish as it might seem based on its most recent move above $2,000. No. Gold is barely above its 2011 high in nominal terms (not to mention real terms), despite loads of dollars being printed in the meantime and even despite the war outbreak in Europe.</p>
        <p>Silver and mining stocks are much below their 2011 highs – in fact, mining stocks are even well above their 2008 highs in many cases.</p>
        <p>This doesn’t show the strength of the market, but rather its weakness.</p>
        <p>As far as analogies to the previous cases, gold, silver, and mining stocks appear to be repeating their performances from previous periods, and the most important of the analogies seems to be the one to what happened in 2008.</p>
        <p>The reason is that it’s not only visible from the technical point of view, and it’s not only visible across many markets, but actually some of the fundamental news surrounding the price moves are similar.</p>
        <p>Starting with the latter, the rates are moving up, and that was also what preceded the 2008 slide (not directly, but still). And do you remember the Lehman collapse that one of the first dominos to fall? This time, it was the Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, in the aftermath of all this both: gold and silver prices plunged profoundly, but there was a huge counter-trend rally first.</p>
        <p>And what did gold do back then? It soared for about a week, then it traded sideways and finally topped slightly higher than it did initially.</p>
        <p>While gold soared, the USD Index declined on a short-term basis, the mining stocks moved higher, but overall followed the general stock market, and… There was a sharp upswing in crude oil prices (as seen on the bottom of the above chart), even though it’s been in a medium-term downtrend.</p>
        <p><strong>It all happened recently, too. Even the sharp upswing in crude oil!</strong></p>
        <p>The price of black gold just jumped, while being in a medium-term downtrend.</p>
        <p>Stock prices are currently moving sideways on a medium-term basis, but their most recent move was to the upside.</p>
        <p>It currently looks like the right shoulder of the head-and-shoulders formation is being formed. The RSI reading shows similarity to what happened in mid-2022 and back then a massive decline followed. Of course, not two periods are identical, but they are similar enough for the implications to be bearish at this time.</p>
        <p>This is especially the case that the volume has been visibly decreasing during the current upswing – exactly like it’s been the case in mid-2022.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the current short-term forecast for stock prices is bearish.</p>
        <p>This means that the implications for mining stocks are bearish as well, since those two markets (mining stocks are stocks, after all!) are connected – and this is the case just like it was back in 2008.</p>
        <p>The USD Index appears to have just finished its short-term decline that’s a correction within a bigger uptrend.</p>
        <p>Again, that’s something that we’ve seen in 2008. Back then, the move lower in the USD Index took less time, but let’s keep in mind that the history tends to rhyme rather than repeat itself to the letter.</p>
        <p>There’s a specific pattern present on the USD Index that affects quite many forex forecasts (not surprising given the USD Index is ultimately a weighted average of forex pairs).</p>
        <p>Namely, the U.S. currency tends to reverse its directions close to the turn of the month. That’s what I marked with dashed lines on the above chart. It seems that this technique worked once again, and a local bottom was formed.</p>
        <p>Zooming in allows us to see that the USD Index actually managed not only to break above its declining resistance line, but also verify this breakout and then rally once again.</p>
        <p>This – combined with above-mentioned monthly seasonal tendency – makes it very likely that the bottom in the USD Index is in.</p>
        <p>Given the negative correlation between gold and the USD Index, it seems that the top in gold is in as well.</p>
        <p>Let’s take a look at the gold price itself.</p>
        <p>After a sharp rally – that took place for about a week (just like in 2008!) – gold price started to move sideways and recently it moved to new intraday high.</p>
        <p>Unless one is aware of the bearish analogy to 2008, the above might seem bullish, but given the carnage that followed in 2008, gold price’s recent behavior is not bullish at all. It’s bearish.</p>
        <p>The fact that gold just moved back below $2,000 on an intraday basis only adds to the bearish implications of the recent price movement.</p>
        <p>What does it all mean?</p>
        <p>It means that despite a positive movement in gold in the last several weeks, gold price analysis actually suggests that a very bearish surprise awaits those, who are taking the price moves at their face value.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil lost ground amid signs of tepid demand, with a stronger dollar and key technical measures also putting a lid on the commodity’s recent rally.</p>
        <p>Some Asian refiners are considering cuts to crude-processing volumes as profit margins shrink, signaling softer oil demand in the region, while weakness in the global diesel market added to the concerns. The stronger dollar and lingering inflation also weighed on prices, with broader markets waiting to hear from Federal Reserve speakers this week.</p>	
        <p>“Worries about stuttering economic growth and untamable inflation are capping efforts to push prices higher,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. “Breaking above the $90 barrier on Brent will be a tall order in the very near future.”</p>	
        <p>Technicals are also providing headwinds for the commodity as the four-week rally has left crude in overbought territory, signaling a correction is possible in the short term. The US benchmark failed to break through its 200-day moving average last week and has been trading lower ever since.</p>
        <p>“Prices need a breath from the latest four-week rally,” said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial Securities. Futures are mostly in overbought territory, causing traders this week to be in a “cautious mode.”</p>
        <p>Oil has rebounded from the banking shock that rippled across markets in March and drove futures to a 15-month low. Shrinking crude stockpiles at the key US storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, and interruptions to supplies from Iraqi Kurdistan have added to the tightening of global markets.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Russia's exports of crude oil have now surpassed the volumes hit before its invasion of Ukraine.</li>
          <li>China and India account for roughly 90% of Russia's seaborne crude exports, Kpler data shows.</li>
          <li>With Europe largely out of the picture, the two countries are each buying 1.5 million barrels a day from Russia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Russia has been able to navigate Western sanctions well enough to push oil exports above levels reached before its war on Ukraine — and new data suggests that Moscow has China and India to thank for that.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, Russia's seaborne crude oil exports totaled 3.5 million barrels per day versus 3.35 million barrels in the year-ago quarter, the tail end of which saw the start of Russia's war on Ukraine.</p>	
        <p>China and India now account for roughly 90% of Russia's oil, with each country snapping up an average of 1.5 million barrels per day, according to commodities analytics firm Kpler,</p>	
        <p>That's enough to absorb the shipments that no longer head to European nations, which used to account for nearly two-thirds of Russia's crude exports. Europe now takes in only 8% of Russia's oil exports, per Kpler.</p>
        <p>"Both China and Russia are taking advantage of discounted Russian crude, benefiting from the sanctions applied on Russian materials by other countries," Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, told Insider Friday.</p>
        <p>Behind China and India, Turkey and Bulgaria are the biggest buyers of Russian crude.</p>
        <p>Even before Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine, China was already a top buyer of Russian crude, importing 25% of its crude from the country in 2021. That's since climbed to 36%, Kpler data shows.</p>
        <p>India, the world's third-largest oil importer, relied on Russia for about 1% of its total volumes prior to the war, but now buys 51% of its oil from Russia.</p>
        <p>The US has led Europe and other Western nations in imposing sanctions and energy price caps on Russia, designed to maintain market flows while curtailing Moscow's export revenue.</p>
        <p>European Central Bank calculations show trade volume between the euro area and Russia has halved since February 2022, with the bloc's imports of Russian imports seeing particularly steep declines following the bans on coal in August 2022, crude oil in December 2022, and refined oil products in February 2023.</p>
        <p>The ECB chart below shows a similar pattern illustrated in Kpler's data, with Russian seaborne crude exports shifting toward Asian buyers and away from Europe.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the revenue Russia generates from its energy exports has fallen along with the drop in prices, even as volumes remain elevated.</p>
        <p>The International Energy Agency said Friday that Moscow's revenue is down about 43% compared to the same time last year.</p>
        <p>But oil prices are heading back up as China's reopening economy drives demand while OPEC and Russia pinch supplies.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut of over 1 million barrels a day, with Russia extending its 500,000-barrel-a-day pullback through mid-2023.</p>

          <li>The IEA estimated oil demand could hit 101.9 million barrels per day in 2023.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Global oil demand is expected to notch a new record this year – and that could spell trouble for crude prices, which are already facing upwards pressure from supply cuts, the International Agency said in a recent report.</p>
        <p>The energy watchdog predicted the world's crude oil demand would jump to a record 101.9 million barrels a day in 2023, up by 2 million barrels a day from last year.</p>	
        <p>Developing economies could account for 87% of the expected demand growth this year, the IEA said, while China alone could account for at least half as its economy continues to reopen.</p>	
        <p>Meanwhile, the global supply of oil is still under stress. OPEC+ announced a surprise production cut earlier this month of over 1 million barrels a day. Russia, which is a member of OPEC+, said it would extend its cut of 500,000 barrels a day cut through mid-2023.</p>
        <p>"Our oil market balances were already set to tighten in the second half of 2023, with the potential for a substantial supply deficit to emerge. The latest cuts risk exacerbating those strains, pushing both crude and product prices higher. Consumers currently under siege from inflation will suffer even more from higher prices, especially in emerging and developing economies," the IEA said.</p>
        <p>Oil prices briefly spiked into the triple-digits last year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine created chaos in markets. Prices have since eased, but the new cuts from OPEC+ would likely more than counteract any non-OPEC+ production increases this year, the IEA said.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate crude is up 2.4% year to date, and Brent crude, the international benchmark, is up 1.6%.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Gold has been shining in recent months, buoyed by safe-haven demand amid recession fears and the banking turmoil. The Fed rate hike pause bets, lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar also added to the strength.</p>
        <p>The most actively traded gold-futures contract rose to $2,055.30 an ounce, up about 13% year-to-date. That has put the bullion within striking distance of its record high reached in the summer of 2020. After logging the best monthly performance since July 2020, gold is on track for the second consecutive gain in April (read: Gold Shines in March: 5 ETFs That Gained the Most).</p>	
        <p>With the rise in prices, almost all gold ETFs hit a new 52-week high in the last trading session. We have highlighted the most popular ones that are flying high. These include SPDR Gold Trust ETF GLD, iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF SGOL and iShares Gold Trust Micro IAUM. Each of these funds gained 10.4% from a year-to-date look.</p>	
        <h3>Behind the Rise in Gold Price</h3>
        <p>The latest batch of economic data points to a slowdown in the economy, prompting bets that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its rate-hike cycle. The yellow metal is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding bullion. A pause or slowdown in the pace of rate hikes will lift gold price higher. The CME FedWatch tool shows markets are pricing in a 66.8% chance of a 25 basis-point hike in May, with rate cuts seen in the back half of the year.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the recent collapse of several U.S. banks led to worries about financial instability across the globe, thus raising the appeal for the yellow metal as a safe haven and a store of value. Growing recession fears and intensifying geopolitical tensions compelled investors to flock to gold. The International Monetary Fund warned that the risk of a recession has grown for advanced economies in the wake of bank failures in the United States and Europe and slashed its outlook for global growth this year.</p>
        <p>Notably, gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle (read: 4 ETF Areas to Benefit as Geopolitical Concerns Intensifying).</p>
        <p>The dollar index slid to a one-year low, supporting the rally in the gold price as a weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers. Further, a boost in gold buying by central banks this year has added fuel to the rally.</p>
        <p>Here’s a detailed discussion on the five ETFs mentioned earlier:</p>
        <h3>SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD)</h3>
        <p>SPDR Gold Trust ETF tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U.S. dollars and kept in London under the custody of HSBC Bank USA. It is an ultra-popular gold ETF, with AUM of $60 billion and a heavy volume of about 7.6 million shares a day.</p>
        <p>SPDR Gold Trust ETF charges 40 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 5 ETFs to Play as Inflation Cools Down to 5%).</p>
        <h3>iShares Gold Trust (IAU)</h3>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust offers exposure to the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion. It is backed by physical gold under the custody of JP Morgan Chase Bank in London.</p>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust charges 25 bps in annual fees. It is liquid and popular, trading in average daily volumes of 5 million shares and has AUM of $29 billion.</p>
        <h3>SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM)</h3>
        <p>SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust seeks to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion. It is a slightly modified alternative to the State Street behemoth gold fund SPDR Gold Trust ETF.</p>
        <p>SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust is the low-cost choice in the U.S. listed physically gold-backed ETF space, charging investors 10 bps in annual fees. It has $6.2 billion in AUM and trades in a solid average daily volume of 1.2 million shares.</p>
        <h3>Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF (SGOL)</h3>
        <p>Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF tracks the price of gold bullion. The Trust holds allocated physical gold bullion bars stored in secure vaults in Zurich, Switzerland and London, the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF has amassed $2.7 billion in its asset base and trades in a solid volume of 2.5 million shares per day. It charges 17 bps in annual fees per year.</p>
        <h3>iShares Gold Trust Micro (IAUM)</h3>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust Micro offers exposure to the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion. It is the lowest-cost gold ETF on the market, having an expense ratio of 0.09% (read: Can Gold ETFs Continue Their Winning Run?).</p>
        <p>iShares Gold Trust Micro has amassed $1 billion in its asset base while trading in an average daily volume of 428,000 shares.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil rose for the fourth straight week, supported by signs of a tightening global market that have the International Energy Agency warning of higher prices ahead.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate settled above $82 a barrel, posting its longest run of weekly advances since June. Crude is hovering near five-month highs after OPEC+ surprised the market with plans to cut more than 1 million barrels of daily output. Declining US stockpiles, weaker flows from Russia and interruptions to pipeline supplies from Iraqi Kurdistan have added to the gains.</p>	
        <p>Markets are digesting a week of mixed projections for crude supply and demand. The latest OPEC+ cuts threaten to boost oil prices for consumers already facing high inflation, the IEA said in its monthly outlook on Friday. The cartel had forecast a day earlier that markets would be deeply undersupplied. In contrast, the US Energy Information Administration projected supplies surpassing demand both in 2023 and 2024.</p>	
        <p>Demand from the world’s largest crude importer is supporting prices as well. Recent data show that China imported the most oil in three years last month, underpinned by record Russian flows. On Friday, People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said the nation’s economy is expected to grow about 5% this year.</p>
        <p>Key technical measures are signaling a tighter market, too. WTI’s prompt spread — the difference between its two nearest contracts — was at 9 cents a barrel in backwardation. The bullish pattern is a stark reversal from when it was trading 16 cents in contango a month ago.</p>

        <p>Global oil markets will see a sizable supply deficit this year, as the production cutbacks of major exporters begin to kick in.</p>
        <p>The world will be short by about 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, more than reversing an expected surplus of 300,000 barrels a day in the second quarter, according to OPEC data cited by Bloomberg.</p>	
        <p>That's after OPEC and non-member partner Russia announced steep cuts to their production. On April 2, OPEC lowered its planned output by 1 million barrels a day, citing protection against price shocks after March's bank turmoil caused a brief drop in the oil prices.</p>	
        <p>Soon after the OPEC news, Russia also announced that it would extend its own cutback of 500,000 barrels a day through the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Actual reductions in oil output may not end up being as steep as the announced cuts to production quotas, given that some members of the coalition are already producing below target levels.</p>
        <p>Still, prospects for tighter oil supplies come as demand will continue to ramp up, putting more upward pressure on crude prices, which have jumped 20% over the last month.</p>

        <p>Vancouver, BC --News Direct-- MarketJar</p>
        <p>After experiencing its strongest run in a decade last year, gold market M&A activity is continuing to ramp up with $40 billion in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the sector so far in 2022.</p>
        <p>Newmont Corporation, the world's largest gold miner, recently launched a US$17 billion bid for rival Newcrest Mining last week, creating expectations of more consolidation to come. But Newmont’s latest bid is just one of many major deals hitting the space as producers look to replace depleting supplies at their current operations.</p>	
        <p>Agnico Eagle Mines and Pan American Silver Corp just completed the acquisition of Yamana Gold for $4.8 billion. BHP Limited is acquiring Australian gold and copper producer OZ Mining for $6.61 billion, while B2Gold Corp just signed a deal to acquire Sabina Gold & Silver for $800 million.</p>	
        <p>If bond yields fall and interest rates rise, the gold price is anticipated to rise as the dollar's purchasing power and consumer quality of living fall. What’s more, prolonged turmoil in global financial markets in 2023 will likely fare well for gold.</p>
        <p>Although gold M&A deals are taking place across the globe, there seems to be a focus on projects in Canada. In Q3 2022, alone there was a total of $562.8 million worth of M&A deals in Canada including Kinross Gold acquiring Great Bear Resources for $1.44 billion, and Agnico Eagle and Kirkland Lake Gold completed a $10 billion merger to become the third-largest gold producer in the world.</p>
        <p>The Canadian gold mining industry also gained significant attention last spring, when billionaire gold investor Eric Sprott made his largest investment to date into early-stage exploration company New Found Gold, which he believes could uncover “the greatest gold discovery in the history of Canada.”</p>
        <p>Another player in Canada’s gold exploration space is Fury Gold Mines (TSX:FURY) (NYSE-A:FURY), a well-funded gold exploration company located in two of Canada's most productive mining regions: Quebec's James Bay Region and Nunavut's Kitikmeot Region.</p>
        <p>The company’s portfolio includes its flagship Eau Claire project in Quebec's James Bay Region, its wholly-owned Lac Clarkie project next door, and the Éléonore South joint venture project with Newmont Gold, host to a large-scale high-grade untested gold-in-till anomaly with "a tremendous amount of exploration upside."</p>
        <p><strong>Canadian Gold Miner Is Strategically Positioned in Two Prolific Mining Regions</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fury Gold Mines Limited (TSX:FURY) (NYSE-A:FURY)</strong>has been focusing its efforts on its flagship Eau Claire project, which is located near James Bay. Earlier this year, a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for the project was completed, revealing an M&I Resource of 808,000 ounces (oz) of gold at 6.65 g/t Au and an additional Inferred Resource of 458,000 oz at 7.48 g/t Au.</p>
        <p>On April 13, Fury announced that it has commenced the 2023 drill program at Eau Claire, which will comprise 10,000-15,000 meters (m) focused on the Gap Zone, Western Hinge, and North Limb targets to build on the success of the 2021 and 2022 drill programs. The company will be focused on the Western Hinge target initially to continue to expand the Eau Claire high-grade gold deposit. Fury plans to commence drilling at the Percival Prospect later in Q2 2023.</p>
        <p><strong>Fury</strong>'s improved geological interpretation of the Eau Claire resource focused on the fold geometry at the Hinge Target, has resulted in an over 25% increase in the mineralized footprint. The mineralized system is still open in all directions, and intercepts of 5.75 g/t gold over 4m, 21.4 g/t gold over 1m, 5.86 g/t gold over 3.5m and 9.36 g/t gold over 3m have been returned. During 2023, the Hinge Target exploration plans will focus on expanding the mineralization footprint further to the west and updip.</p>
        <p><strong>Fury Gold Mines Limited (TSX:FURY) (NYSE-A:FURY)</strong>also recently provided an update on the Lac Clarkie project, which is located just east of Eau Claire. As a result of the conclusion of a B-horizon soil sampling study, the Company has defined eight gold anomalies. Six of the targets are located in the Cannard Deformation Zone, which contains numerous gold occurrences throughout its more than 100 km mapped length, including the Eau Claire Deposit and the Percival Prospect. Fury is attempting to prioritize these newly discovered targets for additional examination in 2023, with the objective of advancing a number of them to the drill-ready stage.</p>
        <p><strong>Fury</strong>is well-funded for planned exploration following a recent private placement for C$8.75 million in cash, C$16.2 million in treasury securities, and 59.5 million Dolly Varden Silver shares.</p>

        <p>BENGALURU (Reuters) -Oil prices fell a dollar a barrel on Thursday, as an OPEC report stoked summer demand worries and traders took profits after benchmarks scaled multi-month highs in the previous session.</p>	
        <p>Brent crude fell $1.24, or 1.4%, to settle at $86.09 a barrel, only the second time this month that the global benchmark has finished lower. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slipped $1.10, or 1.3%, to close at $82.16 a barrel.</p>	
        <p>Both benchmarks had gained 2% on Wednesday to their highest in more than a month, as cooling U.S. inflation spurred hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will stop raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) flagged downside risks to summer oil demand in a monthly report on Thursday, highlighting rising inventories and challenges to global growth.</p>
        <p>The report shed light on the reasons behind a surprise production cut announced by OPEC+, which includes Russia and other OPEC allies, at the start of this month</p>
        <p>"Generally I would say we saw builds in oil inventories this week in those countries which publish stocks data, so maybe that is what has been a realization that the market hasn't shifted into a deficit," UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.</p>
        <p>Despite Thursday's declines, the OPEC+ decision has pushed Brent futures up nearly 8% so far this month, and it continues to raise expectations of potential future tightness in the oil markets.</p>
        <p>Oil price declines were also limited as OPEC kept its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2023 unchanged. Other economic indicators lent further support.</p>
        <p>The U.S. dollar index fell to a two-month low on Thursday after producer prices unexpectedly declined in March, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve is near the end of its interest rate hiking cycle.</p>
        <p>A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated oil cheaper for investors holding other currencies, lifting demand.</p>
        <p>"With the dollar at its weakest in a year versus the euro, that formula kicks in with an exclamation mark," said Mizuho analyst Robert Yawger.</p>
        <p>Signs of a demand recovery in China, the top importer of crude oil and products, provided more support for oil prices, Yawger said.</p>
        <p>China's crude oil imports in March surged 22.5% from a year earlier to the highest since June 2020, data showed on Thursday.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- One oil exchange-traded fund saw its largest one-day outflow in more than three years, a possible sign that some investors remain concerned about the outlook after OPEC+ delivered an unexpected supply cut.</p>
        <p>WisdomTree’s Brent Crude Oil ETP — ticker BRNT — had an outflow of $55.7 million on Thursday, the largest one-day fall since late 2019. Another fund, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF — ticker UCO — saw outflows of $158.5 million last week. That’s its biggest weekly drop since March 2022.</p>
        <p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies announced a surprise output cut earlier this month, led by Saudi Arabia. While that helped prices to surge last week, concerns about a potential slowdown in demand have lingered. There’s speculation both that the US could tip into recession, hurting consumption, and OPEC+ actions telegraph its concerns about market weakness.</p>
        <p>“There is still a large segment of the market concerned over the demand outlook and OPEC+ cuts would have likely only reinforced these concerns,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV in Singapore.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- OPEC+’s surprise oil-production cut sent shock waves through financial markets and pushed crude prices up by the most in a year. Now that the dust has started to settle, one question looms large: Will that price rally stick, or fade away?</p>
        <p>Banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to RBC Capital Markets LLC raised their oil-price forecasts immediately after the OPEC+ cut. Yet, many traders still believe a souring economic outlook will block the group’s actions from pushing prices higher. Demand indicators are also starting to flash warning signs.</p>
        <p>It could end up being the ultimate test of what matters more to the market: tighter supplies, or the lackluster demand picture. That will likely bring more uncertainty over the direction of prices — a complicated development for the Federal Reserve and the world’s central bankers in their ongoing battle against inflation.</p>
        <p>“It’s a very hard market to trade right now,” said Livia Gallarati, a senior analyst at Energy Aspects. “If you’re a trader, you are pulled between what’s happening at a macroeconomic level and what’s happening fundamentally. It’s two different directions.”</p>
        <p>One thing that is certain: A major shift of market control into the hands of Saudi Arabia and its allies has now been cemented, with huge implications for geopolitics and the world’s economy.</p>
        <p>Investors have continued to reward US drillers for production discipline, making it unlikely that shale companies will ever again undertake the kind of disruptive growth that helped to keep energy inflation tame last decade. That leaves the oil market under the purview of OPEC+ at a time when some experts have predicted that demand is heading to a record.</p>
        <p>“The surprise OPEC cuts have already triggered fears of a resurgence in inflation,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, a lead index trader at commodities brokerages Marex Group Plc. “These renewed inflation concerns should only increase” in the months ahead, he said.</p>
        <p>Here is an overview of what traders will be watching in the oil market.</p>
        <p>Summer Demand</p>
        <p>The timing of OPEC’s decision has struck an odd chord for many oil experts.</p>
        <p>The production cuts don’t take effect until May, and much of the repercussions are likely to be felt in the second half of the year. That’s a time when oil demand typically reaches its seasonal peak, partly thanks to the busy summer driving season in the US. It’s also the point when China’s economic reopening is expected to start swinging into full gear, further underpinning demand.</p>
        <p>Typically, OPEC would want to take advantage of that consumption burst by selling into the market as much as possible. Instead, the cut means the cartel is holding back. That’s sparking debate about whether the move will end up driving oil prices to $100 a barrel as demand surges, or whether, instead, the cartel and its allies are preparing for a recession-marked summer of tepid consumption.</p>
        <p>“While OPEC+ cuts on the surface are generally seen as bullish, it does also raise concerns over the demand outlook,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING. “If OPEC+ were confident in a strong demand outlook this year, would they really feel the need to cut supply?”</p>
        <p>Moves in global fuel markets underscore the demand skepticism. While oil prices rallied, moves for refined products were less pronounced, shrinking margins for refiners across Europe and the US. In Asia, prices of diesel, a key refinery product, are signaling heightened slowdown concerns as timespreads shrink to their lowest since November.</p>
        <p>Elevated Stockpiles</p>
        <p>While US inventories have been declining, global inventories are still high.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, commercial oil stockpiles held in OECD countries were sitting about 8% above last year’s levels, according to estimates from the US Energy Information Administration. That’s a fairly sizeable buffer and a sign of the weakness in consumption that’s plagued the market in the past few months.</p>
        <p>“You do need to chew through that overhang first before we can see we upside,” said Gallarati of Energy Aspects.</p>
        <p>Russian Flows</p>
        <p>Oil bulls have waited in vain for a Russian output cut promised for March to show up. The Kremlin said it would slash production by 500,000 barrels a day in March in retaliation for import bans and price caps imposed by “unfriendly countries.” But there’s been no sign of lower Russian output showing up in the one measure that matters to global crude markets — the number of barrels leaving the country.</p>
        <p>Crude shipments from Russia’s ports hit a new high in the final week of March, topping 4 million barrels a day. That’s 45% higher than the average seen in the eight weeks before Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine and has been boosted by the diversion since January of about 500,000 barrels a day delivered by pipeline directly to Poland and Germany.</p>
        <p>Shale’s Production Discipline</p>
        <p>It wasn’t long ago that there were two major players that oil traders turned to for direction over supplies: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the US shale industry.</p>
        <p>At the time, OPEC and shale were locked in a battle for market share. It was a feud that helped to keep global oil prices — and energy-driven inflation — at bay for the better part of decade.</p>
        <p>Then the pandemic hit, and with it an oil price rout that suffocated the shale industry. For the last three years, even as the market recovered and cash flow surged, companies have prioritized dividends and share buybacks over new drilling. It’s been a winning strategy. Since March 2020, the S&P 500 Energy Sector Index has surged almost 200%, outpacing the S&P 500’s nearly 60% gain.</p>
        <p>Now, as calls for peak shale output gather pace, OPEC has one less factor to consider when making supply decisions.</p>
        <p>That’s a sore spot for President Joe Biden, who was quick to downplay the impact of the decision by the cartel and its allies to cut output by more than 1 million barrels per day. Biden vowed after an initial production cut last year that there would be “consequences” for Saudi Arabia, but the administration has yet to follow through.</p>
        <p>Futures Curve</p>
        <p>Talk of $100 oil has been buzzing since the end of last year, but it seems like the can keeps getting kicked down the road. First, some analysts had predicted prices would reach that threshold in the second quarter of 2023. The view got pushed into the second half of the year, and now even some of the bigger bulls aren’t expecting the magic number to come into play until 2024.</p>
        <p>The oil futures curve is reflecting those expectations. Prices for contracts tied to deliveries as far out as December 2024 and 2025 have rallied, even as benchmark front-month futures are starting to ease.</p>
        <p>“The OPEC+ output cut certainly raises the possibility of $100 a barrel this year, although it is by no means a certainty,” said Harry Altham, an analyst at brokerage StoneX. “Demand-side weakness stemming from growth considerations is clearly taking a more prominent role.”</p>

        <p>The gold standard as it existed under the Bretton Woods system until 1971 is likely never coming back. There are a myriad of reasons for this but the most important lie with the US government’s ability to control the economy. Under the gold standard, the government no longer has the tools it uses to support the economy.</p>
        <p>This mostly includes the government’s control over the USD. Under a gold standard, those with the most gold naturally control the dollar. While a large portion of gold is mined in the U.S., a majority is produced by foreign powers. Moving back to the gold standard would effectively entail surrendering the dollar to the control of those with the most stockpiles of the metal.</p>
        <p>So the Bretton Woods gold standard isn’t tenable but is the current fiat system much less problematic? Many believe that the new system concentrates too much power in the Federal Reserve. For example, the Fed increased the M2 money supply (the amount of all dollars in circulation including deposits) by 27% in 2020-2021 under its aggressive Quantitative Easing (QE) program that aimed to prevent a recession. This was the largest increase in the country’s history, beating out even the second world war (18%) and the 2008 financial crisis (10%). To the surprise of (almost) no one, this heavily contributed to widespread, lasting inflation that is still affecting American citizens today.</p>
        <p>Economists still argue over whether the Fed’s actions were positive or negative on the whole but many agree that QE unfairly benefits monolithic corporations over small businesses and individuals. Many detractors of the buying spree hope that a gold standard could be a good way to bring the Fed into line.</p>
        <p>A full gold standard is probably impossible but (state) Senator Bryan Huges (R) and Representative Mark Dorazio (R) of Texas think they have found a way to bring back many of its benefits. They introduced matching bills to their respective houses that propose the introduction of a gold-backed digital currency.</p>
        <p>The bills state that “The [state] comptroller shall establish a digital currency that is backed by gold so that each unit of the digital currency issued represents a particular fraction of a troy ounce of gold held in trust.” They would also require that “The trustee shall maintain enough gold to provide for the redemption in gold of all units of the digital currency that have been issued and are not yet redeemed for money or gold” to prevent bank runs.</p>
        <p>The bills’ sponsors made sure to add that the funds received from purchasing the digital currency, the gold held under the trust, and any proceeds resulting from the sale of the redeemed gold are not available for legislative appropriation. This would prevent the state legislators from pillaging the trust and hopefully keeping the gold backing intact.</p>
        <p>This bill is fascinating in many different ways. It’s an interesting attempt to return to some semblance of the gold standard as well as one of the world’s first potential experiments in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
        <p>The bill also raises intriguing questions about the future of federalism in the U.S. For example, would the Treasury Department allow Texas to create its own digital currency? There doesn’t seem to be a clear answer yet but it seems to be outlawed in the constitution under Clause 1 of Section 10, depending on your interpretation. The clause states that “No State shall...coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts...”</p>
        <p>Texas isn’t the first state to attempt to create their own state currency. At least 13 other states considered it after the 2008 financial crisis. Legislators argued that the section of the clause that says “make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts” allows this, despite the fact that “no state shall...coin Money” appears in the same sentence.</p>
        <p>The Texas bills haven't been assigned to a committee yet (the next step of the legislative process after a bill is presented) so these questions may not be answered for a long time. Until then, investors will have to settle with physical gold and other precious metals to protect their portfolios. In the end, physical gold will likely still be the superior safe haven asset because you can store it yourself to avoid counterparty risk.</p>
        <p>Investors are turning to gold and silver in droves to protect their portfolios as uncertainty rises in the economy.

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>The existential threat to Saudi Arabia and the OPEC cartel comes from China, not from net zero or from green deals in the West.</p>
        <p>Chinese sales of petrol and diesel cars fell 20pc in absolute volume terms in February from a year earlier. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles kept rising explosively and reached a record 32pc of the market for standard passenger cars.</p>
        <p>At the current pace, EV sales in China will hit eight million this year, helped by the proliferation of battery-swapping stations. Rather than charging your own car, you do an instant swap. No need to wait. No need for charge-points everywhere.</p>
        <p>Sales have surged despite the elimination of subsidies at the end of last year.  China’s best-selling EV is the BYD Song Plus, which retails for about £22,000. Number two is the smaller Wuling Mini. It starts at around £4,000 (not a misprint).</p>
        <p>“They are producing cheap EVs for the mass market, which is still completely lacking in the West. It is absolutely taking off,” said Lord Adair Turner, chairman of the global Energy Transitions Commission (ETC).</p>
        <p>The consensus forecast until recently was that EV penetration would reach 40pc of Chinese sales by 2030. That threshold could be crossed as soon as this year if manufacturers can produce fast enough to meet the demand. “We think EVs will reach 80pc of sales in China by 2030,” said Kingsmill Bond from energy strategists RMI.</p>
        <p>Electrification is spreading to light commercial vehicles, up 85pc year-on-year.  Over 60pc of buses in service in Chinese cities are already low-carbon. All municipal buses on the eastern seaboard will be electrified by 2025. Long-haul trucks are next in line.</p>
        <p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that EVs worldwide have already displaced 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) of oil use, or 1.5pc of global demand. This is about to accelerate exponentially.</p>
        <p>“China’s demand for oil is suddenly going to start falling. Half of China's total car fleet could be electric by 2030. If you add up the numbers, that could subtract several million barrels of oil a day,” said Lord Turner.</p>
        <p>“China’s high speed rail network means that there won’t be so much internal aviation either. Oil use per capita is never going to be anything close to American levels,” he said.</p>
        <p>Opec maintains the fiction that oil demand will keep booming until the middle of the century, but this is based on the obsolete premise that Asia's rising middle class will more than compensate for declining imports in Europe and America.</p>
        <p>“Whatever they say in public, the Saudis know the game is up. They can see that the world’s largest car market for petrol cars is going to collapse,” said RMI’s Mr Bond.</p>
        <p>For the last 40 years the Saudis have acted (mostly) as ‘Federal Reserve’ of the global oil market, working closely with the US and Europe to maintain stability. They would restrain Opec hotheads from pushing prices too high at critical moments, knowing that this would backfire by accelerating the switch to rival technologies.</p>
        <p>It has abandoned this role as market regulator under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The strategy today is to extract as much money as possible from crude reserves before the window shuts forever, deliberately forcing prices higher (by cartel practices) to exploit captive demand for legacy transport.</p>
        <p>Last weekend’s Saudi-led decision by Opec and Russia to cut global supply by a further 1.1m b/d is an act of weakness. It is not the action of states seeking to preserve a sustainable business model.</p>
        <p>It was an affront to President Joe Biden but it was no favour for Xi Jinping either. Oil shocks are horrible for China. Its energy intensity per unit of GDP is two and a half times higher than in the US.</p>
        <p>America is largely self-sufficient in crude: China is the world’s largest importer by far at 10.8m b/d. Its oil-import dependency has risen to 70pc, a greater level of vulnerability than the US at the worst point of the Arab oil embargo in 1973.</p>
        <p>This oil is mostly shipped in tankers through the Straits of Molucca. China is also the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, which also comes on ships. This is a glaring geostrategic weakness as the superpower clash with the US turns increasingly dangerous.</p>
        <p>Chinese strategists can see how the West is using its stranglehold over global tanker fleets, vessel insurance, and shipping finance to asphyxiate Russia. They have also studied Franklin Roosevelt’s blockade of Japanese oil imports in 1941. They know that China cannot risk a showdown over Taiwan until it has a safer supply of energy.</p>
        <p>Hence the massive expansion of renewable power currently underway. Great tracts of desert in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang are being covered with solar panels and onshore turbines, bundled with extra coal capacity as a back-up to avoid winter blackouts.</p>
        <p>Xi Jinping’s original plan was to reach 1,200 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar by 2030. China’s Research Academy of Environmental Sciences says this target will be achieved five years early, given that the rollout is running at 180 GW a year.</p>
        <p>This compares to total installed capacity of 33 GW in France, 42 GW in the UK, and 240 GW in the US since the start of the green era.</p>
        <p>Nikhil Bhandari and Amber Cai from Goldman Sachs think China will smash the target three times over, reaching a staggering 3,300 GW by the end of this decade, all backed by a vast expansion of energy storage. They estimate that the county could halve its total energy imports by the early 2040s.</p>
        <p>This would require $2.2 trillion of investments but that should not be understood as a cost. Goldman says combined renewables with storage operating around the clock will be highly profitable by 2030 as they undercut coal, with a rate of return on capital reaching 10pc.</p>
        <p>They think China’s total CO2 emissions will peak as soon as 2028.</p>
        <p>China is not doing this as a favour to the West. It is doing so in order to confront the West from a position of greater strength in the future, and because it aims to become the world’s clean-tech hegemon.</p>
        <p>The Chinese have already cornered 90pc of global production of solar panels, and control 70pc of the lithium output – although that may matter less as sodium-ion batteries arrive.</p>
        <p>One can be too cynical about China’s motives. Xi Jinping was an environmental crusader 20 years ago as Zhejiang party chief.  He was a pioneer of the radical ‘Green GDP’ campaign in 2004, which called on local governments to subtract ecological damage from the raw GDP figures. He knows that China is more immediately vulnerable to climate change than the US or Europe.</p>
        <p>Chinese scientists say the Himalayan glaciers – the Third Pole – are melting even faster than previously thought. They will shrink by two-thirds over the course of this century under current warming trends, exposing China’s ancient river systems to the annual devastation of spring floods followed by summer droughts. So yes, China has to act.</p>
        <p>China’s green leap forward is a nightmare for Big Oil. It is compelling America and Europe to respond in kind, causing a step-change in the arms race for clean-tech ascendancy.</p>
        <p>The EU’s retreat from its 2035 ban on combustion engines makes no difference in this larger geo-economic context. The permitted e-fuels, made from green hydrogen, are too wasteful and expensive to have any commercial relevance. They retain just 16pc of the original energy input compared to 77pc for EVs.</p>
        <p>The next generation of solid state batteries and lithium-air variants will complete the annihilation in the late 2020s, opening the way to EVs with much longer driving ranges, much lower costs, and less reliance on scarce minerals.</p>
        <p>Technology married to market forces will render fossil-fuel bans in the EU, the UK, Japan, California, or Quebec superfluous before they come into force.</p>
        <p>Personally, I had assumed that oil would enjoy one last hurrah in the early 2020s as a decade of under-investment drives prices to $150 or $200. But this does not seem so inevitable any more. The rallies keep fading.</p>
        <p>The events of the last week suggest that the process of oil displacement is more advanced than we had assumed. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the petrostates have already entered the first stage of terminal run-off.</p>

        <p>SEANA SMITH: You're looking at gold off a little bit today, pulling back from a 13-month high on weaker economic data. Still, though, obviously, above 2,000. Gold since the start of the year up just about 10%, hovering above that critical $2,000 level here, and just trading just about 50 bucks below its record high. We want to bring in Bob Iaccino. He's Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. Bob, it's good to see you here. So we're holding above that 2,000 level. I think a lot of investors are asking if there's really upside here to the price of gold. What do you think?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: I think there is. Gold was my big call for the year. I'm sticking with that as of this point. I still think we're going into recession, although the timeline may be pushed a little bit. The yield curve says we're already there. Economic data is going to start to slow. And if you're long gold, which I am, the best case scenario is the Fed cuts rates to get you into-- or I'm sorry, out of a recession, which is positive for gold.</p>
        <p>Worst case scenario, the Fed continues to raise rates. I think this is the least likely. And they hold-- or they hold the pause a little bit longer. Two out of three of these cases is good for gold. The worst case scenario is that they hold the pause, and we actually get this soft landing or easy landing or even no landing. That wouldn't be great for gold, and I think that's the least likely scenario.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Fed certainly plays a role. Bob, talk about some of the other factors driving the prices where they are today.</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, again, you have this issue of asset prices being sold off. And gold has always taken advantage of that. And what's generally happened is, the Fed-- again, bringing that out-- cuts rates to help the economy and help asset prices. That's been a driver of gold in the past. And a lot of people believed that. CME Fed watch tool has cuts starting in July of this year, which the Fed says they're not going to do.</p>
        <p>Another one is people think of gold as an inflation hedge. And it's really not. What gold is, is it's an asset. And if you look at assets in general, when inflation starts and then continues to rise through, gold powers through that because it's an asset, just like house prices, just like stocks. We forget the good part about inflation is asset inflation, and gold is an asset. The problem comes in for gold investors when the Fed starts to aggressively fight inflation.</p>
        <p>So something we haven't had, which has contributed to gold's underperformance over the last decade or so, was we haven't had inflation, so we haven't had a Fed to fight inflation. And that's kind of gave gold this weakness. When inflation started, gold rallied. We saw that March spike that references almost the all-time high that Seana mentioned. We're driving toward that again. And if we are in a situation where, as Neil Dutta from Renaissance or at Macro put it, inflation remains unaddressed, then gold's going to benefit from that.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: Bob, how much upside is there to gold? Are we talking 2,500? Are we talking above that?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, here's where people think I'm nuts. I think we can easily break to new highs. And I think if it goes the way I think it's going to go, easily within the next 12 months, we could see 2,800. I used to say by the end of the year. I'm not saying that anymore because I think the Fed was much more aggressive than I thought they would be when I made that call.</p>
        <p>But I think the issue here is the popular opinion and the politically popular opinion is that the Fed should stop trying to fight inflation. And I don't think people realize how bad that is for the whole country, as opposed to just 2 or 3 million people. And I don't mean to downplay that. I want to stress that.</p>
        <p>But the 2 or 3 million people that may lose their jobs in a recession, a recession, as investors should look at it, is good for gold. I'm sorry, it's good for stocks. It's not necessarily good for gold. Where gold outperforms is when there's inflation and a recession. And I think that's what we're going to because I think the Fed is going to cave in to pressure and stop fighting inflation.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: 2,800 call-- gutsy. All right, Bob, with that, we want to play a little game. We want to see how deep your love for gold goes. We're calling this Bob's Buys. We'll give you a choice between two investments. You'll tell us which is the buy and why. First up, Bitcoin, which has been surging with gold, which seems a little odd on its face. So Bitcoin or gold?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: So I have to ask you a question first, and we actually did this with a recent guest on our podcast. Is this 100% in one or the other?</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Is it 100%? I'm not sure.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: You mean all in on gold or all in on Bitcoin?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Yeah, can I go 70/30, or I can't do that?</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I see what you're saying.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: Yeah, sure, you can make your own twist to the game. We're open to suggestions, Bob.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Well, look at you making up your own rules. I was going to say 100%, but go, go.</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, actually, if you make me pick 100, it's gold. I am actually in about 70% gold, 30% Bitcoin for that amount of the capital that we allocate to this sort of space because I think the issue with Bitcoin is, is it here in 10 years or not? I think it is, but I don't run that sort of part of the game, so.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, Bob, well, we're setting you up here because we have a couple to get through. So the next one's up is treasuries, TIPS, or gold? What do you think?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Gold.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: You're sticking with it. Didn't even have to think twice about it.</p>
        <p>DAVE BRIGGS: I want to get back to the prior answer. What do you make of the dynamic, though? Gold rising typically tells us people are risk averse. How does that rise with arguably the most speculative asset on the planet in Bitcoin? How do those rise together?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: So Bitcoin has a couple of things going for it. It's, again, beginning to perform in a non-correlated way, which I like. It hadn't done that. It was correlated very sharply to the NASDAQ. That's not the case anymore, at least in the short-term. If that sticks with it, then a non-correlated asset is always good in any environment. So that's really the core of it.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, Bob, and last up here, I bonds or gold? What do you think?</p>
        <p>BOB IACCINO: Wow, that one's tough. I'm going to have to say gold, too. But I think if you put me in a position, I'd go 60% gold, 40% I bonds.</p>
        <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, there we go. All right, gold the winner of all three. You're the gold guy, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised by that. Bob, great to see you. Thanks so much.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- For months, the Middle Eastern oil market has been among the tightest in the world as regional exporters support Asia’s recovering demand. This week, OPEC+’s surprise output cuts made it even stronger.</p>
        <p>Key markers in the Dubai crude market — the benchmark for Middle Eastern grades — leapt higher after the Saudi-led decision. The most active timespread for Dubai swaps jumped to above $1 a barrel in backwardation, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd, outperforming the Brent curve.</p>
        <p>While OPEC+’s production cuts will take effect only next month, Dubai’s strength reflects expectations that the reductions will strengthen an already-robust market for Middle Eastern supplies. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait pledged to cut a combined 980,000 barrels a day of output, with generally heavier and more sulfurous crude as the bulk of their production.</p>
        <p>That’s likely to lift the relative value of Dubai crude — which is both a proxy for Middle Eastern oil markets as well as medium-sour oil varieties — against global benchmarks such as Brent even further, a shot in arm for long-haul cargo flows from the Atlantic Basin and Americas into Asia.</p>
        <p>Even prior to the OPEC+ cuts, traders were already bullish on Dubai versus other crudes, as red-hot Chinese demand hoovers up the region’s supplies and lackluster European consumption weighs on Brent.</p>
        <p>“Given the bulk of the cuts stem from medium and heavy Middle Eastern producers, we would not be surprised to see Dubai trade at a premium to Brent in the coming months, particularly as China looks to ramp imports,” RBC analysts including Mike Tran and Helima Croft wrote in a report.</p>

        <h3>By Seher Dareen</h3>
        <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices hit their highest since March 2022 on Wednesday, extending a rally after weaker U.S. economic readings bolstered bets U.S. interest rates will rise more slowly.</p>
        <p>Spot gold was up 0.1% to $2,022.79 per ounce by 1120 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were unchanged at $2,038.10.</p>
        <p>Analysts said gold was well-placed to sustain gains above the $2,000 level as weaker prospects for interest dilute the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, which is also a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.</p>
        <p>"The 'third time's the charm' for gold, having probed above the $2,000 level in both August 2020 and March 2022. This time it appears to be able to sustain the momentum as dark clouds gather within the economy," independent analyst Ross Norman said.</p>
        <p>He said weaker economic data had shifted the emphasis from "inflation-busting to saving the wider economy".</p>
        <p>Gold rallied 2% on Tuesday after U.S. job openings in February dropped to the lowest in nearly two years.</p>
        <p>The dollar index edged higher, yet still near two-month lows, making bullion cheaper for buyers holding other currencies. [USD/]</p>
        <p>There has also been an improvement in the gold market mood, said Carsten Menke, head of Next Generation Research at Julius Baer in a note, "indicated by the return of short-term speculative traders and trend followers".</p>
        <p>Euro zone recovery gathered pace last month but the upturn was uneven, and the ECB could raise rates by 25 basis points at its May, June and July meetings a Reuters poll found.</p>
        <p>While the markets expect a pause on U.S. rate hikes in May, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said the central bank likely had more rate hikes ahead, pushing the terminal rate over 5%.</p>
        <p>Traders also await economic cues from the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday.</p>
        <p>Silver was down 1.1% to $24.74 per ounce, platinum gained 0.6% to $1,022.99 while palladium jumped 1.2% to $1,474.73.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil eked out a gain after a report showed that US job openings in February fell to the lowest since 2021, reigniting concerns over a global economic slowdown.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate settled above $80 paring gains on disappointing labor data after initially rising almost 2%. Before the US economic report, prices had extended the largest rally in a year stemming from the surprise decision Sunday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to slash crude production by over 1 million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Short-term upside is limited until the market sees more inventory draws and stronger demand, said Jonathan Wagner, global head of crude options at Marex North America. “In this macro environment, ahead of payrolls this Friday, the signal of employers not looking for workers is not helping,” said Wagner.</p>
        <p>Crude has soared about 20% from the low point in mid-March. The rebound was driven initially by expectations Chinese demand would pick up following the end of restrictive Covid policies. The OPEC+ surprise decision allowed markets to rally the most in a year, with the move being aimed to punish speculators that bet oil prices would fall.</p>
        <p>While uber-bull Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded their price forecasts in the wake of the decision, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. kept forecasts unchanged. Morgan Stanley even lowered its outlook, noting China’s demand growth has lagged behind expectations.</p>
        <p>The market largely ignored the potential resumption of oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region on Tuesday. The region’s government said it will sign an agreement that may clear the path to restart shipments via the Turkish port of Ceyhan.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil said it’s restarting units over the coming days at the oil complex near Le Havre in France that had been halted after protests disrupted supplies.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Teck Resources Ltd. is willing to entertain offers from potential suitors after it finishes the spinoff of its steelmaking coal business, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
        <p>The Canadian miner said Monday it rejected an unsolicited $23 billion proposal from Glencore Plc and will forge ahead with an April 26 shareholder vote on separating its metals and coal divisions. If investors approve, the split is expected to happen by the end of May, with the base metals producer being renamed Teck Metals Corp.</p>
        <p>At that point, the Teck board is likely to be open to hearing offers from prospective partners or buyers including Glencore, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.</p>
        <p>The Swiss commodities firm’s offer for Teck, at a 20% premium, is another sign that big mining companies are on the hunt for acquisitions. BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto Plc are also said to be actively looking to increase their copper exposure.</p>
        <p>“The board and special committee are confident that the proposed separation into Teck Metals and Elk Valley Resources is in the best interests of Teck and all its stakeholders,” Chris Stannell, a spokesperson for Teck, said in an emailed statement. “Teck’s proposed separation positions Teck Metals and EVR for success and does not foreclose future opportunities for other value-enhancing transactions at the appropriate point and time.”</p>
        <p>In rejecting Glencore’s all-share offer, Teck Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Price said Monday that the spinoff structure proposed by the Swiss firm would expose Teck shareholders to its large thermal coal and oil trading businesses. Norman Keevil, Teck’s chairman emeritus, said that “now is not the time to explore a transaction of this nature.”</p>
        <p>Teck has also proposed ending the dual-class share structure that gives control to Class A shareholders — the Keevil family and its partners. But that change wouldn’t take effect for six years. In the meantime, a hostile takeover of Teck is impossible.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Europe has negotiated through the winter of a crisis that threatened to choke energy supplies and overwhelm its economy, but officials are warning that the squeeze may not yet be over.</p>
        <p>Fears of blackouts and freezing homes have faded for now, and gas reserves remain far fuller than normal. The region is entering a crucial period of replenishing those stockpiles, and avoiding a crunch next winter hinges on its success. It won’t be able to rely on the usually massive supply of pipeline gas from Russia, and EU officials are leaning on companies to end LNG imports from the country.</p>
        <p>The perils from a year ago will be fresh on policy makers’ minds. Heat waves, the worst drought in centuries, nuclear outages in France and overall panic about Russia’s dwindling gas exports resulted in a record surge in prices. They’ve fallen more than 80% since then, and the outlook holds few worries for the months ahead. BloombergNEF sees enough supplies available to fill inventories to the EU’s goal of 90% by the end of October.</p>
        <p>The market remains wary a repeat of last year’s events will flip the balance once again. There are also new worries about a rebound in Chinese demand, and an even deeper curtailment in Russian supplies — pipeline and liquefied natural gas, said Andrew Walker, a vice president at major LNG provider Cheniere Energy Inc.</p>
        <p>“There are a lot of key risks sitting out there,” he said at the European Gas Conference in Vienna.</p>
        <p>With summer coming and small volumes of gas already starting to be sent into storage sites, here are some of the biggest concerns for the continent.</p>
        <p>China and Fight for LNG</p>
        <p>Record LNG imports formed the backbone of Europe’s efforts to tackle the crisis over the past year. But the jostling for cargoes could start increasing.</p>
        <p>The International Energy Agency has warned that Europe still faces a risk of supply shortages this year, unless it further curbs consumption, with China’s LNG demand being the biggest unknown. The agency has a 40 billion cubic meters difference between its highest and lowest estimates for the nation’s net LNG imports this year. That’s the equivalent of about 8% of Europe’s total demand last year.</p>
        <p>Some industry watchers, like Wood Mackenzie, are not very bullish, at least for now. The consultant expects China’s booming domestic gas production and continued increase in Russia’s pipeline supplies to limit the need for LNG imports, and keep them below the peak of 2021 even in a high-growth scenario.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, cheaper LNG is also bringing back appetite from smaller buyers in Asia, which increases competition, according to trader Vitol Group.</p>
        <p>Industrial Demand Recovery</p>
        <p>Signs are emerging that gas use by industry — which made up almost half of total demand reduction in Europe last year — is rebounding. A recovery is showing in the oil refining and petrochemical industries in Spain, the Netherlands and France, where it is easier to switch fuels than in other sectors.</p>
        <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and SEB AB have warned that gas prices may more than double from current levels if industrial demand returns. But how big will the rebound be? Many manufacturers shut or relocated some operations last year as energy costs turned prohibitive, and there’s no certainty they will return. An unfolding banking crisis could also hit European industries.</p>
        <p>Fuel Switching</p>
        <p>Declining gas prices are making it attractive again for Europe’s power stations, in comparison to alternatives like coal or oil.</p>
        <p>Coal power generation in Europe increased last year, ending a run of steady declines. It has been lower so far this year — as has gas — because of higher renewables output, primarily wind. But, gas use for electricity outstripped coal at times over the past month, according to consultant Rystad Energy AS. The shift is also aided by more expensive carbon permits, which are needed by power stations to spew emissions.</p>
        <p>French Nukes</p>
        <p>Electricite de France SA’s troubles are quickly turning out to be one of the biggest risks to Europe avoiding another crisis next winter. The beleaguered utility’s nuclear stations have suffered from technical errors, contributing to a record number of reactors going offline last year in the country and pushing atomic output to the lowest in 30 years.</p>
        <p>As a result, power was the only sector in Europe where gas consumption remained relatively steady last year even though overall electricity demand declined, while wind and solar output jumped.</p>
        <p>EDF has found new defects that have caused energy prices to spike several times this month. While the company has left its nuclear power production forecast for this year unchanged, more problems would further strain power networks and increase demand for gas. Widespread strikes in the country haven’t helped either.</p>
        <p>Another Drought?</p>
        <p>Memories of the arterial Rhine River drying up and becoming impassable last year are still fresh, as is the record heat and droughts that limited hydroelectric and nuclear production. Climate change is making severe weather events more likely.</p>
        <p>The hydrological balance in the Alps — or the amount of energy stored in reservoirs and snowpack compared with seasonal norms — already shows the biggest deficit since 2017 for the time of year. Hot weather could boost demand for gas for cooling, and if the Rhine dries up again, it can disrupt the movement of coal and oil products to Germany.</p>
        <p>Russia Risk</p>
        <p>Russia’s share of total gas demand in the European Union dropped to under 10% by the end of last year from 40% in 2021 as most nations switched to alternatives such as US LNG. Even that little supply, especially the part coming by pipelines crossing Ukraine, has been under constant risk as the war moves into its second year.</p>
        <p>While pipeline flows have dwindled, imports of LNG — which aren’t restricted — from the country have surged. But there’s now growing pressure on European companies to end these purchases. Some like the UK and the Baltic nations have already banned these imports. The EU is targeting a way to allow members to follow suit but it isn’t implementing any new sanctions or announcing specific measures.</p>
        <p>Spain, one of Europe’s top buyers of the Russian fuel, has directly urged companies to reduce these purchases, but a blanket ban would be challenging to achieve.</p>
        <p>Russia accounted for 14% of total European LNG imports last year, said Leo Kabouche, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. If the region were to ban those flows, the loss would be “significant and would be extremely challenging to replace.”</p>
        <p>The possibility of a total cut off from Moscow, risks of infrastructure sabotage or unplanned outages at major projects this year — as well as competition with China — could put the gas market under pressure again, Matthew Baldwin, deputy director general of the European Commission’s energy department, said at the conference in Vienna.</p>
        <p>“We experienced unprecedented, volatile energy prices last year, it looks better but we are not complacent,” he said. “We are not out of the woods. So we stay vigilant, we stay together.”</p>

        <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices retreated on Wednesday as investors trickled back into riskier assets betting that risks of contagion from the global banking crisis have been curbed for now.</p>
        <p>Spot gold was trading 0.4% lower at $1,965.89 per ounce, as of 0924 GMT. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.3% to $1,967.50.</p>
        <p>Gold has retreated as "markets are going risk-on as fears of contagion within the banking sector abates," said independent analyst Ross Norman.</p>
        <p>European shares rose, echoing an upbeat mood in Asian markets. [.EU]</p>
        <p>Further pressuring bullion, the U.S. dollar firmed 0.2%. A stronger dollar makes bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. [USD/]</p>
        <p>Gold traders, meanwhile, remained focused on the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy, with investors pricing in a 40.5% chance of a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>
        <p>Last week, the central bank suggested it was on the verge of pausing future hikes, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to reining in inflation.</p>
        <p>"Our outlook for the second half of 2023 for gold remains positive but not outrageously so as inflation persists and the Fed continues to try and edge rates higher until something breaks," Norman added.</p>
        <p>Higher rates tend to dull zero-yield gold's appeal.</p>
        <p>"The Fed will have to choose between higher inflation, a harder landing or financial instability - all outcomes will keep safe havens in play," likely prompting gold to retest and pierce all-time highs ($2,070/oz) this year, metals firm MKS PAMP said in a note.</p>

        <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil rose for a third session on Wednesday as a halt to some exports from Iraqi Kurdistan raised concerns of tightening supply and as easing fears of a global banking crisis supported risk sentiment in the wider markets.</p>
        <p>Crude exports of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region were halted on Saturday following an arbitration decision that confirmed Baghdad's consent was needed to ship the oil.</p>
        <p>Brent crude climbed 42 cents, or 0.5%, to $79.07 a barrel by 0802 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude increased 61 cents, or 0.8%, to $73.81.</p>
        <p>"The longer the stoppage continues, the tighter the supply outlook will become," said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Norwegian oil firm DNO said it had begun shutting down production at its fields in Kurdistan. The company's Tawke and Peshkabir fields averaged output of 107,000 bpd in 2022, a quarter of total Kurdish exports.</p>
        <p>Also helping sentiment was easing worries over the banking sector after weeks of volatility in the market that had sent oil to a 15-month low on March 20, with investor nerves soothed by the sale of assets in collapsed lender Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
        <p>"The recent rebound in oil prices is mainly driven by sentiment. We can see that risk sentiment has recovered to some extent, which pushed (the) global stock markets and crude oil rebound," said CMC Markets analyst Leon Li.</p>
        <p>Oil also gained support from a drop in U.S. crude inventories. According to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday, crude stocks fell by 6.1 million barrels.</p>
        <p>Attention will focus on official U.S. inventory data from the Energy Information Administration at 1430 GMT to see if it confirms the crude stock decline.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil clung to gains as a disagreement between Iraq and Kurdish officials curtailed exports and fears of a banking meltdown receded.</p>
        <p>West Texas Intermediate edged forward Tuesday and has recovered almost 10% since dropping to a 15-month low in the immediate aftermath of the banking crisis. A legal dispute between Iraq, Kurdistan, and Turkey has halted around 400,000 barrels a day of flows, constricting global supplies.</p>
        <p>The market shrugged off concerns of a buildup of crude vessels along the coast of France as widespread strikes there forced most of the nation’s fuelmakers to halt operations. Strong Asian demand for the barrels has prevented prices from sliding.</p>
        <p>While oil has rallied from recent lows as the banking sector stabilizes, it remains on track for a fifth monthly decline amid concerns over a potential US recession and resilient Russian energy flows. Most market watchers are still betting that China’s recovery will accelerate and boost prices later this year as demand rebounds.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, OPEC+ is showing no signs of adjusting oil production when it meets next week, staying the course amid turbulence in financial markets, delegates said.</p>
        <p>Investors will also be watching comments from several US Federal Reserve officials, as well as a key measure of US inflation due this week, for clues on the path forward for monetary policy. Interest-rate hikes have added to bearish sentiment.</p>

        <p>Investors are flocking to gold exchange-traded funds following weakness in the banking sector and a subsequent slump in confidence.</p>
        <p>The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the largest gold ETF, has pulled in $489 million so far this year, etf.com data shows. That’s a reversal from the more than $1 billion in outflows the fund saw in the last quarter of 2022, the data shows. Meanwhile, the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) has hauled in $431 million during the same period.</p>
        <p>Last week, gold prices surged beyond $2,000 an ounce on rekindled fears of a banking crisis in the wake of the Credit Suisse takeover. That’s the first time bullion has traded above $2,000 since March 2022.</p>
        <p>Though spot gold prices eased slightly to $1,969 by Tuesday, they remain 7.7% higher than the $1,826 at which the metal started the year. Meanwhile, gold futures have inched up 7.6% year to date to $1,986.</p>
        <p>But that uptick in price and rush to gold ETFs may be due to a crisis of confidence, as recent tumult in the U.S. banking industry led to the collapse of several banks before spreading to Europe and rattling that continent’s financial sector, according to Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.</p>
        <p>“Gold can't go bankrupt,” Rhind said in an interview with etf.com. “People have always fled to gold in an environment where they don't have confidence in putting money in a bank account or buying bonds from either a government or from a corporation.”</p>
        <p>GLD has gained 7.3% year to date, according to etf.com data, while GLDM has jumped 7% as concerns over banking failures remain elevated. Deutsche Bank stock has sunk more than 22% in the past month on renewed market jitters.</p>
        <p>Also spurring the gold rally could be a weaker U.S. dollar and a prospective easing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve,” said Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion.</p>
        <p>“Gold and even silver are very sensitive to dollar strength or weakness; there's an inverse relationship between those two,” he added.</p>
        <p>“You've had a weaker dollar here, a little bit of a shift with the Fed in terms of maybe how aggressive they're going to be going forward. As a result, rates have started to drop,” Egilinsky explained, noting how the factors have given gold more traction.</p>

        <p>Halliburton and Honeywell in advanced talks to develop oil fields and refineries in Libya; Eni importing more oil and gas from Algeria</p>
        <p>CAIRO—After years of underinvestment in North Africa’s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows.</p>
        <p>Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals.</p>
        <p>Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy’s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria.</p>
        <p>Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt.</p>
        <p>“North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,” said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy, “this is their moment,” he said.</p>
        <p>Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region’s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say.</p>
        <p>At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food. The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices.</p>
        <p>“I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,” NOC’s Mr. Bengdara said.</p>
        <p>The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.</p>
        <p>Halliburton and Total didn’t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Libya’s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant.</p>
        <p>Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports.</p>
        <p>As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country’s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021.</p>
        <p>Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias.</p>
        <p>The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia’s paramilitary Wagner Group, the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country’s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya, is aligned with the government in Tripoli.</p>
        <p>“There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,” said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as “an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.”</p>
        <p>NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion.</p>
        <p>In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country’s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026.</p>
        <p>In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm’s top region for investment in the next four years.</p>
        <p>“Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,” said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January.</p>
        <p>From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year.</p>
        <p>Egypt’s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn’t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.</p>

        <p>Yahoo Finance’s Ines Ferre joins the Live show to discuss the dip in oil prices after the U.S. signaled it will wait before refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).</p>
        <p>JARED BLIKRE: Energy markets dipping on worries about an oversupply, especially after the US signaled it will wait before refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The SPR weakness there contributing to the overall gloom in the markets. Here with more is Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines.</p>
        <p>INES FERRE: Yeah, Jared, and this lower oil prices, it's really having an impact on energy as a whole, energy stocks, equities as well. Let's take a look at our YFi Interactive board so we can see where the underlying commodity crude oil is right now. You're looking at WTI that is down more than 1 and 1/2%. You've got crude right now that is on pace for its biggest first quarter drop since 2020. That's when the pandemic hit, and you saw demand being wiped out. This week, we had a little bit of a rebound when it came to oil, but today, we are seeing losses, taking out a big chunk of the gains that we had seen this week.</p>
        <p>Also, Brent crude down 1.8%. Remember that last week, you had oil that, on a weekly basis last week, lost almost 10% of its value. A lot of this has to do with a stronger dollar, which is impacting the price of oil because oil is invoiced in dollars. You've got the US now that is holding off on refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as you just mentioned, Jared. Also, you have Russian oil that is still coming into the market, despite the Western sanctions. And then you've got concerns about a US recession, and the banking concerns, the banking worries deepening worries of a recession. You've got institutions that are selling their oil futures.</p>
        <p>Now, we have been seeing Wall Street sort of pulling back a little bit on their forecast when it comes to crude oil for the end of the year, but not as much as you would think. I mean, one of the commentaries that I saw out there is that this isn't necessarily like 2008, where oil touched a low of $39 a barrel. Analysts aren't seeing oil going that much lower. But nonetheless, we are seeing a selloff when it comes to oil recently.</p>
        <p>And then just taking a look at other commodities, look, if you are a gold bug, you are happy this week because gold touched $2,000 an ounce. I've spoken to analysts saying, this is it for gold, guys. The gold is coming out-- is breaking out from here. We'll see, but certainly, one analyst telling me, 2024, that's going to be huge for gold. Guys.</p>

        <p>In this article, we take a look at 15 largest oil fields in the world. If you want to see more largest oil fields in the world, go directly to 5 Largest Oil Fields in the World.</p>
        <p>Oil fields are areas where there is substantial oil in multiple oil reservoirs that are trapped by impermeable rock above. In oil reservoirs, oil exists as tiny droplets inside open spaces called pores inside rocks. Given the pressure that exists deep beneath the surface, oil can squeeze through tiny pores of underground rock. Furthermore, given the earth's natural heat deep below ground in some fields, oil also wants to squeeze to the areas above.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy describes the process, "Oil in a reservoir acts something like the air in a balloon. The pressure comes from millions of tons of rock lying on the oil and from the earth’s natural heat that builds up in an oil reservoir and expands any gases that may be in the rock. The result is that when an oil well strikes an underground oil reservoir, the natural pressure is released—like the air escaping from a balloon. The pressure forces the oil through the rock and up the well to the surface."</p>
        <p>Some oil fields are offshore while others are onshore. Many oil fields also produce natural gas, although the total mix of oil and gas can vary substantially from oil field to oil field. Depending on their location and geology, the cost to extract oil from oil fields can vary as well. For those of you interested, check out 15 Countries That Produce the Most Oil in the World.</p>
        <p>Many of the world's largest oil fields are in the Middle East as several countries in the region have substantial reserves of oil. Many of the world's most economical to extract oil fields are also in the Middle East given the region's favorable geology.</p>
        <p>Because they have operational expertise and capital, big oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) sometimes help nations develop some of their oil fields. In addition to extracting oil from oil fields, oil companies also have to transport the oil often through pipeline to export facilities or to refineries that do further processing.</p>
        <p><strong>The World's Largest Oil Fields</strong></p>
        <p>In terms of the world's largest oil fields, some of the largest oil fields have already produced a lot of oil like China's Daqing Field which began full scale production in 1963. Meanwhile others like Kazakhstan's Kashagan Field are relatively new.</p>
        <p>Given their size and the importance of oil, some of the world's largest oil fields are also important to the global economy. The world's largest oil field, Saudi Arabia's Ghawar Field, for instance, produces around 4 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for well over 1/3 of Saudi Arabia's total production. Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of oil in the world, with crude oil exports of 7.28 million barrels per day in November of 2022.

        <p><strong>Crude Oil</strong></p>
        <p>In terms of crude oil, the price of the commodity has fallen recently as economists worry of an economic slowdown as a result of the recent Silicon Valley Bank failure. If oil prices decline, companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) might not be as profitable as they could have been.</p>
        <p>In the longer term, the world will need to reduce its dependence on crude oil as a transportation fuel to reduce carbon emissions. In the near and medium terms, however, the world is expected to continue to need crude oil for transportation and for many refined crude products.</p>
        <p>In terms of oil prices, it isn't clear where they will go as many factors can influence the oil price.</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
        <p>For our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World, we used Stacker's Largest oil fields in the world list and data from Stacker. Given the company's calculations, it isn't clear whether the data is barrels of oil or barrels of oil equivalent, which could include natural gas.</p>
        <p>Stacker includes cumulative past production in its oil field size data. Because some mega oil fields have already produced much of their oil, they don't have as much future production capability but nevertheless still rank on our list.</p>
        <p>We ranked the oil fields based on the total reserves based on cumulative past and future production potential.</p>
        <h3><strong>15 Largest Oil Fields in the World</strong></h3>
        <h3>15. Marun Field</h3>
        <p><strong>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 22 billion barrels</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Country: Iran</strong></p>
        <p>Iran was the eighth largest producer of oil in 2021 with production of 3.6 million barrels per day in the year. As the country's second largest producing oil field, Marun Field is one reason why. Discovered in 1963, the oil field produced around 1 million barrels per day at its peak in the 1970's and the field still produces around 600,000 barrels of oil per day according to a Bloomberg article in 2020.</p>
        <h3>14. Samotlor Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 25 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Russia</strong></p>
        <p>Russia is an energy superpower with substantial oil and gas reserves. As far as oil fields go, Samotlor Field is the country's largest oil field with 25 billion barrels of cumulative past production and future production potential. Like Marun Field, Samotlor Field is an oil field that has already produced a lot of oil. At its peak, the field produced around 3 million barrels per day in the 1980's.</p>
        <h3>13. Prudhoe Bay</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 25 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: United States</strong></p>
        <p>Prudhoe Bay is America's largest oil field in terms of total oil reserves when including cumulative past oil production. The Alaskan oil field has been active for over four decades and still has over 800 active wells. Although production in Prudhoe Bay is declining and well below its peak in the 1980's, U.S. oil production has nevertheless increased over the years, ranking the country #1 in the world in terms of oil production in 2021 with 16.59 million barrels per day produced in 2021.</p>
        <h3>12. Tengiz Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 26 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Kazakhstan</strong></p>
        <p>Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field ranks #12 on our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World given its total oil reserves of 26 billion barrels based on past and future production. Tengiz Field is the country's highest oil producing field with official capacity of 600,000 barrels per day as of 2022. With a planned expansion, however, the oil field could have oil production capacity of 850,000 barrels per day by 2024.</p>
        <h3>11. Kashagan Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 30 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Kazakhstan</strong></p>
        <p>Kashagan Field is another giant oil field in Kazakhstan with substantial oil reserves. According to estimates, the Kashagan Field could have 30 billion barrels of oil reserves when including cumulative past production, ranking it among the largest in the world. As a country, Kazakhstan had total oil production of around 1.6 million barrels per day in 2022 and S&P Global Platts Analytics expects Kazakhstan's oil output to reach 2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 2.6 million barrels per day by 2030.</p>
        <h3>10. Aghajari Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 30.2 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Iran</strong></p>
        <p>Aghajari Field in Iran is one of the oldest big oil fields in the world given it was first discovered in 1938. Although it has total oil reserves based on cumulative past production and future production potential of 30.2 billion barrels, much of the oil in Aghajari Field has already been produced.</p>
        <h3>9. Bolivar Coastal Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 32 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Venezuela</strong></p>
        <p>Venezuela's Bolivar Coastal Field is the country's largest oil field and also one of the oldest given it was discovered in 1917. According to Stacker, Bolivar Coastal Field has total oil reserves based on cumulative past production and future production potential of 32 billion barrels.</p>
        <h3>8. Cantarell Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 35 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Mexico</strong></p>
        <p>Cantarell Field is comprised of four fields that was first discovered in 1972. Given the oil field has already produced a lot of oil, production in Cantarell Field is declining and the oil field was surpassed in 2009 as the biggest oil field in Mexico in terms of production.</p>
        <h3>7. Safaniya Oil Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 37 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: Saudi Arabia</strong></p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia's Safaniya Oil Field is one of the two largest offshore oil fields in the world along with UAE's Upper Zakum Oil Field. According to Reuters, Safaniya Oil Field had production capacity of over 1 million barrels per day in 2019 and mainly produces heavy oil. It ranks #7 on our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World given its total oil reserves of 37 billion barrels when including cumulative past production.</p>
        <h3>6. Daqing Field</h3>
        <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 42 billion barrels</p>
        <p><strong>Country: China</strong></p>
        <p>Daqing Field is China's largest oil field that still produces around a third of the country's total oil despite entering full scale production in 1963. Given its growing large economy and insufficient domestic oil production, China is the world's largest importer of oil and production from Daqing Field helps reduce imports.

      description: <div className="blog-desc">
        <p>Precious metals like gold and silver have been rallying lately. This is because investors have been seeking safe-haven investments amid growing risks emanating from the banking crisis in the United States and Europe, high inflation, hawkish central banks, fear of prolonged global growth slowdown and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China relations as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Precious metals like gold and silver have been rallying lately. This is because investors have been seeking safe-haven investments amid growing risks emanating from the banking crisis in the United States and Europe, high inflation, hawkish central banks, fear of prolonged global growth slowdown and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China relations as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
        <p>In the latest statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), to a funds range of 4.75%-5.00%. The move was largely expected. However, the Fed’s language in its statement grew notably milder from the last meeting, even as it clearly stated that inflation is still “elevated.” The Fed also indicated that “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”</p>
        <p>A softening in the Fed’s hawkish tone and the resultant decline in U.S. rates should weigh on the dollar against a basket of currencies, raising the precious metals’ attractiveness as these do not pay interest like fixed-income assets. Notably, the U.S. dollar is now at a seven-week low. Analysts believe that precious metal prices will witness momentum.</p>
        <p>The Fed indicated that further increases in borrowing costs might be postponed (or there may be just one more rate hike worth 25 bps this year) due to the recent failure of two U.S. banks. A low-interest-rate environment makes non-yielding bullion an intriguing bet. Plus, gold is traditionally viewed as an inflation hedge and thus is well-positioned to take advantage of the recent spike in global inflation.</p>
        <p>SPDR Gold Shares GLD has risen 8.1% in the past month, while iShares Silver Trust SLV has gained 4%. But in the past five days, SLV has added 5.8% versus a 2.7% uptick in GLD (as of Mar 22, 2023).</p>
        <h3>What to Buy Ahead? Gold or Silver</h3>
        <p>We believe that gold has run up a little bit higher. It’s just 1% off from its 52-week high whereas silver is still 13% off its 52-week high. So, the poor man’s gold has more room to run than the yellow metal. Moreover, the operating backdrop is more favorable for silver as it has high usage in industrial activities. About 50% of the total demand for silver comes from industrial applications.</p>
        <p>The Fed is likely to take less-hawkish actions, going forward. This should bolster industrial activities. Manufacturing activity in China expanded and logged its highest reading in nearly 11 years. China’s reopening following the COVID-led lockdown is a huge plus for the manufacturing sector.</p>
        <p>Growth in the global solar PV industry and new sources of demand for sensors used in IoT are providing a boost to silver demand. The recent emergence and faster rollout of 5G globally is another positive for silver. The electronic components that enable 5G technology depend on silver greatly. Silver’s role in electronic applications used in 5G is forecast to rise significantly.</p>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>If we go by the relative strength index (RSI), SLV has an RSI value of 64.31 while GLD has an RSI value of 66.95. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.</p>
        <p>Hence, the value indicates that while both ETFs are in high momentum, silver has good chances of outperforming gold. But if the economic backdrop remains this edgy, global growth slows down and inflation remains hot, gold will outshine the manufacturing metal silver.</p>
        <h3>ETFs in Focus</h3>
        <p>Apart from the largest ETF SLV, investors can also bet on the likes of Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF SIVR, Invesco DB Silver Fund (DBS) and ProShares Ultra Silver AGQ to realize gains in silver.</p>
        <p>And for gold ETFs, investing options include the likes of iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF SGOL and ProShares Ultra Gold UGL.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- European companies are using more natural gas as prices drop to levels seen before the Ukraine war, putting a potential strain on preparations for another winter with limited Russian supplies.</p>
        <p>The green shoots are mainly evident in the refining industry, which can switch more easily between raw materials ranging from natural gas to fuel oil. Earlier this month, Dutch data showed the country’s petroleum sector had the biggest weekly gain in gas use this year, while French and Spanish gas network figures indicated refiners’ demand advanced in February from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The speed of the recovery will be crucial for the European Union and how it readies for a second winter with no pipeline gas from Russia. Rebounding demand could push prices past €100 ($109) per megawatt-hour this year, from about €43 now, and chip away at stockpiles, according Swedish bank SEB AB. It’s a view echoed by Vitol Group, one of the biggest gas traders.</p>
        <p>“Some manufacturing industries last year shifted from gas to fuel,” said Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive officer at TotalEnergies SE. “Now this year they are very reactive, they shift back from diesel or fuel to gas, so it’s creating an additional demand,” he said at a presentation in London on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>European Refiners Eye Natural Gas Again After Price Drop: BNEF</p>
        <p>Along with refineries, petrochemical plants will also be a good indicator of the recovery because they can easily switch back to gas to make power and heat, according to Energy Aspects Ltd.</p>
        <p>“Other gas-intensive sectors will take longer to recover over the course of 2023 owing to their demand reductions being the result of reducing output rather than fuel switching,” the industry consultant said.</p>
        <p>As gas prices soared to records at the height of the energy crisis, Spanish industrial gas demand plunged as much as 40% in September from a year earlier. Overall usage by factories and plants slumped about 20% last year in Europe, accounting for almost half of the record drop in total consumption last year, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, the IEA expects demand in industry to recover by about 10%.</p>
        <p>From a peak above €340 per megawatt-hour in late August, benchmark Dutch gas futures have dropped about 90%. In February, usage by Spain’s refiners soared 8.1%, helping to pare an overall drop by industry to 9.5% from a year earlier, network operator Enagas SA said.</p>
        <p>In the Netherlands, gas use in the petroleum and the chemical industries have also started to exceed last year’s levels this month, CBS data show.</p>
        <p>“Lower energy costs — combined, possibly, with stronger demand from China’s reopening — mean that we expect industrial production to make some positive contributions to growth in the euro area this year,” said Maeva Cousin, a senior euro-area economist at Bloomberg Economics.</p>
        <p>While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the industrial recovery will start to gather pace by the end of this month, other analysts warned it could still be a while.</p>
        <p>“It will take time for gas tariffs from gas suppliers to fall enough and over a sustainable period for factory managers to take the decision to resume output,” Energy Aspects said.</p>
        <p>Factories Moving</p>
        <p>Despite the plunge in prices, they are still way above the historical average and are expected to remain elevated until about 2025 when new global supply is poised to arrive.</p>
        <p>That means some demand may be lost forever as factories relocated to parts of the world where energy costs are lower.</p>
        <p>Chemical firms BASF SE, Dow Inc. and Lanxess AG are poised to cut thousands of jobs and shift investment out of Germany because they don’t expect Berlin to reliably provide the energy they need at prices close to those they once paid for Russian pipeline gas.</p>
        <p>A survey from Germany’s VCI chemical association earlier this year revealed that almost half of companies plan to cut investment in the country this year due to high energy costs. Production is likely to shift to countries with similar values and political systems, said Oliver Wojahn, an analyst at Alsterresearch AG.</p>
        <p>“The outlook for the future has brightened somewhat in Germany’s third-largest industry,” VCI said in a report this month. “The major drop in energy and raw material prices in recent months has stabilized the situation where the bottom seems to have been reached. Unlike the pandemic or the global economic crisis, this time there will be no powerful recovery.”</p>

        <p>(Reuters) - Gold dipped on Friday in a volatile week that saw bullion prices north of the key $2,000 figure as bank contagion fears bolstered both safe-haven demand and bets on a pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
        <p>The U.S. dollar rose about 0.5%, making the greenback-priced gold more expensive among overseas buyers on Friday. [USD/]</p>
        <p>Spot gold fell 0.8% to $1,977.01 per ounce by 2:34 p.m. EDT (1834 GMT), after it rose to $2,002.89 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.6% to settle at $1,983.80.</p>
        <p>A somewhat firmer dollar and a rebound in equity markets and risk appetite are probably what has driven gold lower, said Bart Melek, head of commodity markets strategy at TD Securities. But bullion was likely to get continued support from big macro developments, Melek said. [MKTS/GLOB]</p>
        <p>Rescue measures for struggling banks eased contagion fears earlier in the week, putting gold on course for its first weekly decline in four, down about 0.5%, despite having climbed to its highest in a year above $2,000 on Monday.</p>
        <p>But banking shares were trounced again on Friday, with European giants Deutsche Bank and UBS knocked by worries that regulators and central banks have yet to contain the worst shock to the sector since the 2008 financial crisis. [.N]</p>
        <p>"Any concern that pops up about U.S. banks being undercapitalized is going to be a factor for gold to rise," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.</p>
        <p>Fed officials said there was no indication financial stress was worsening as they gathered at a policy meeting this week, a fact that allowed them to stay focused on lowering inflation with another interest rate increase.</p>
        <p>The U.S. central bank this week raised rates by an expected quarter of a percentage point but signalled it was on the verge of pausing.</p>
        <p>Silver eased 0.1% to $23.07, platinum fell 0.7% to $977.776, and palladium dropped 0.7% to $1,420.40.</p>

        <p>Rising interest rates have been putting downward pressure on gold, but the shaky banking sector recently pushed prices past the $2,000 mark. With investor confidence in banks waning, this could continue to bolster gold prices as they seek to add precious metals for safety.</p>
        <p>Along with the rescue of U.S. regional bank First Republic, Europe's Credit Suisse has been grabbing the financial news as of late with its recent rescue thanks to help from global investment bank UBS. Bank rescues can help re-instill market confidence, but more bank failures could continue to push investors to safe havens like gold.</p>
        <p>“Long-term damage has been done to the credibility of U.S. banks,” said Chintan Karnani, director of research at Insignia Consultants, who also noted in a MarketWatch report that the banking fallout could be just be the tip of the iceberg. “Significant price corrections (if any) in gold price will be for a very short period.”</p>
        <h3>3 Options for Gold Exposure</h3>
        <p>There are three options where investors can get gold exposure. For direct correlation to holding physical gold, consider the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), which is a fund that provides an enhanced physical bullion structure, offering the ease of purchase and sale that comes with being traded on an exchange.</p>
        <p>For a backdoor play on ancillary gold services, investors can also consider the Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM). If demand continues to rise for gold, this can have a domino effect on miners for indirect exposure to gold prices.</p>
        <p>Per SGDM’s fund description, the ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance of its underlying index, the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index. The index aims to track the performance of larger-sized gold companies whose stocks are listed on Canadian and major U.S. exchanges.</p>
        <p>The index uses a transparent, rules-based methodology designed to emphasize larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield, and the lowest long-term debt to equity. The index is reconstituted on a quarterly basis to reflect the companies that have the highest factor scores.</p>
        <p>Lastly, investors looking for gold exposure with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) component can consider the Sprott ESG Gold ETF (SESG). The fund directly sources from select gold producers that Sprott believe are leaders when it comes to ESG mining and sustainability.</p>
        <p>SESG also adds a backdoor play on gold prices, investing in ancillary services (i.e. mining) that support the gold market as opposed to the actual precious metal itself. In addition, the inclusion of an ESG filter gives conscious investors an opportunity to allocate capital to gold miners exhibiting ESG-friendly operations.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>A massive new gas pipeline to China could help reduce Russia's reliance on European buyers, but analysts say the project reveals a growing imbalance between the longtime strategic allies.</p>
        <p>Beijing emerged as an economic lifeline for Moscow last year, especially through energy purchases, after Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut off crucial trade links.</p>
        <p>Moscow is confident that the new pipeline -- Power of Siberia 2 -- is going ahead, but Beijing has so far avoided an explicit commitment.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the lagging response shows an imbalance favouring Beijing in energy deals between the two countries -- as well as China's wariness of over-reliance on Russia for fuel.</p>
        <p>China is "in no rush to sign anything unless the proposal is favourable and is shaped on China's terms," researcher Maria Shagina at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Berlin told AFP.</p>
        <p>The project was discussed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week.</p>
        <p>Putin said after talks with Xi that "all agreements have been reached" on the Power of Siberia 2 project.</p>
        <p>But their joint statement only said the two sides will work on pushing forward "research and consultation" on the pipeline.</p>
        <p>The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for more details.</p>
        <p>Power of Siberia 2 could facilitate the transport of 50 billion cubic metres of gas to China annually, roughly on par with the total capacity of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany.</p>
        <p>A senior Russian official suggested last year that it could strategically replace Nord Stream 2.</p>
        <p>- 'Russia is desperate' -</p>
        <p>Previously the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Russia's gas exports plummeted in 2022 after a flurry of Western sanctions over the Ukraine war.</p>
        <p>As Europe looked for other suppliers, Moscow turned to alternative buyers including China, with which it is already linked by the first Power of Siberia pipeline.</p>
        <p>In 2022, China overtook Germany to become the top buyer of Russian energy. It has paid a total of $12.2 billion for coal, gas and oil from Russia so far this year, according to the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.</p>
        <p>Russian gas deliveries to China through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline reached a record 15.5 billion cubic metres last year.</p>
        <p>But sales to Asia pale in comparison with the 155 billion cubic metres of gas Russia exported to Europe prior to the Ukraine war.</p>
        <p>"Russia is desperate to send as much gas as possible eastwards as Europe strives to reduce its dependence on Russian gas," said Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute.</p>
        <p>And a potential Power of Siberia 2 gas deal would consolidate China as a long-term market, said Jaime Concha, a gas market expert at industry analysis firm Energy Intelligence.</p>
        <p>Russia's existing pipeline infrastructure "was mostly structured to cater to the European market", Concha told AFP.</p>
        <p>Building up an equivalent network in Asia would be costly and time-consuming, he said, "which shows how few alternatives Russia has".</p>
        <p>- 'Lessons from Europe' -</p>
        <p>China, meanwhile, has sought to ensure a diverse set of energy suppliers.</p>
        <p>It has signed a flurry of long-term gas deals around the world in recent years, including a $60 billion, 27-year agreement with Qatar in November.</p>
        <p>"Chinese policymakers also observe the lessons from Europe of overreliance on Russian energy imports," said Yan Qin, lead carbon analyst at Refinitiv.</p>
        <p>With a strengthened position in energy negotiations with Russia, "China emerged as the winner from the war in Ukraine", IISS researcher Shagina told AFP.</p>
        <p>"Beijing capitalised on Moscow's international isolation and ramped up its purchases of heavily discounted Russian oil, gas, and coal."</p>
        <p>At the same time, China has felt the bite from the turmoil in global energy markets.</p>
        <p>The war in Ukraine has pushed thermal coal prices at China's Qinhuangdao port "almost as high as Europe", Qin said, while rising LNG prices have hit gas power plants and industrial users.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, she said, the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline could "enhance China's gas imports capacity greatly and potentially reduce China's LNG imports demand".</p>

        <p>With the forces of geopolitics and social normalization trends converging, investors may want to consider energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. What exactly does that entail, though? For one thing, the underlying sector – especially the hydrocarbon arena – will command long-term relevance. While the ideological winds seek to replace fossil fuels, renewable sources often lack the energy density required to compete effectively.</p>
        <p>The other component that makes the below energy stocks exceptionally compelling is that they hit the sweet spot of being undervalued (by objective standards) but highly rated among Wall Street analysts. Further, it’s not just about the baseline assessment itself. Rather, each of the names below commands an average price target that implies double-digit reward potential.</p>
        <h3>PBF Energy (PBF)</h3>
        <p>A petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, and lubricants (among many other products), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) deserves special consideration as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With social normalization trends likely to increase traffic volume on our roadways, PBF offers an opportunity to profit. Indeed, since the January opener, PBG gained over 12% of its equity value.</p>
        <p>Financially, the company isn’t perfect but it holds its own. For instance, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 5.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, PBF’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.61 times, favorably below the industry median of 1.67 times.</p>
        <p>Operationally, the refiner posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, ranked better than 79.48% of the oil and gas sector. Most importantly regarding this topic of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices PBF at a forward multiple of 4.94. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 71.07% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PBG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.44, implying over 22% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Marathon Petroleum (MPC)</h3>
        <p>A petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is one of the larger players in its field. At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $56 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MPC returned shareholders almost 14%. In the past 365 days, it moved up 58%. Still, it technically ranks as one of the underrated energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot.</p>
        <p>Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.42. As a discount to earnings, Marathon Petroleum ranks better than 68.76% of sector rivals. In addition, MPC trades at 0.36 times sales. However, the sector median value, in this case, is 0.93 times.</p>
        <p>Notably, Marathon carries an Altman Z-Score of just under 4, indicating an enterprise safe from bankruptcy. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA pings at 1.12 times, below the sector median of 1.67 times. Moreover, Marathon’s a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%. Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $147.92, implying over 17% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Valero Energy (VLO)</h3>
        <p>A downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it covers other petrochemical products and power. Because of the ongoing social normalization trends, VLO easily represents one of the more relevant energy stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, they’re up nearly 37%.</p>
        <p>Even with the tremendous upside, VLO technically remains underrated. For instance, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.43. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than 68.61% of its peers. Also, VLO trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company beats out 80.23% of the industry.</p>
        <p>Further, Valero enjoys a robust balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.55. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, outpacing 76% of competitors. In closing, analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy (with one sell rating). Overall, the average price target comes out to $161.67, implying over 25% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY)</h3>
        <p>Based in Houston, Texas, Magnolia Oil & Gas (NYSE:MGY) is one of the underrated energy stocks for good reason. Since the beginning of this year, MGY fell over 7%. In the past 365 days, it gave up nearly 15% of its equity value. Still, the exploration and production (upstream) company could be an intriguing idea to consider, especially if you like to gamble.</p>
        <p>First, Magnolia enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.73 times, outbidding 65.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.61, which ranks better than nearly 66% of the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.9%, while its net margin is nearly 53%. Both stats rank well into the industry’s upper half.</p>
        <p>Regarding valuation, the market prices MGY at a trailing multiple of 4.36. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) is 4.64 times, below the industry median of 7.3 times. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $29.67, implying nearly 45% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Devon Energy (DVN)</h3>
        <p>Focused on hydrocarbon exploration, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) commands a relevant profile among energy stocks. Unfortunately, DVN failed to resonate with investors so far this year. Since the Jan. opener, DVN gave up a worrying 19% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s off the mark by 23.5%. Nevertheless, for those that want to live a bit dangerously, DVN offers something to think about.</p>
        <p>Despite its market losses, Devon enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Notably, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times ranks better than 73.15% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.7% and a net margin of 31.38%. Both stats rank well in the upper half of the hydrocarbon sector.</p>
        <p>Most importantly for our discussion of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices DVN at a forward multiple of 5.75. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60.69% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DVN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target currently stands at $68.75, implying over 46% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Arch Resources (ARCH)</h3>
        <p>A coal mining and processing firm, Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the U.S. Per its public profile, Arch is the second-largest supplier of coal in the nation. Despite its relevancies, since the beginning of this year, ARCH slipped over 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down 13%.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, for contrarian investors, ARCH may be one of the energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. Presently, the market prices ARCH at a trailing multiple of 2.04. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.67% of sector players. Also, its price-to-FCF comes in at 2.65 times. Here, the applicable discount for Arch ranks better than 69.47% of the industry.</p>
        <p>Beyond the valuation, Arch benefits from a solid balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.43. Also, the coal firm’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 41%, above 74.15% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ARCH as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target pings at $201.33, implying nearly 54% upside potential.</p>
        <h3>Evolution Petroleum (EPM)</h3>
        <p>Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. As with some of the riskier energy stocks, EPM looks shaky at the moment. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20%.</p>
        <p>Still, for the contrarian investor, EPM could also rank among the underappreciated energy stocks to buy. Financially, Evolution benefits from excellent strengths in the balance sheet. In particular, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.84 times, above 77.23% of the industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 5.51 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Regarding the theme at hand, the market prices EPM at a trailing multiple of 4.51. As a discount to earnings, Evolution ranks better than 68.46% of its rivals. Also, it trades at 2.82 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median value is 4.41. Lastly, Northland Securities’ Donovan Schafer, CFA, pegs EPM as a buy. Further, the expert anticipates shares hitting $11, implying nearly 97% upside potential.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Australian coal is finally flowing to China, opening up another avenue for shipments in what’s shaping up as an increasingly oversupplied market this year.</p>
        <p>Some 207,000 tons arrived in China in February, including 73,000 tons of the higher-grade coking coal prized by steel mills, according to customs data. Although the total is just a sliver of China’s massive import haul of over 60 million tons so far this year, they’re Australia’s first new cargoes since Beijing imposed its unofficial ban in late 2020 after relations with Canberra soured.</p>
        <p>Before the halt, Australia was China’s No. 2 overseas supplier after Indonesia. But that ranking has since been taken by Russia, which has seen its sales to China boom after other buyers shunned its product due to the invasion of Ukraine. Now, Australia is back in the mix, with imports that could rise to 20 million tons this year, according to one industry estimate.</p>
        <p>Steelmakers in particular are likely to be glad of the extra supply after Mongolia, another key miner of coking coal, launched a new auction system that raised prices for Chinese buyers, according to industry news portal Yulin Coal Web.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, China is mining record quantities of the fuel as it prioritizes energy security after a string of power outages in recent years. Output in the first two months climbed to 734 million tons. Including imports, Fengkuang Coal Logistics estimates that China had about 65 million tons of additional coal in the first two months compared to last year.</p>
        <p>The extra supply is doubtless designed to feed the reopening of China’s economy after three years of Covid Zero restrictions. But Beijing’s modest growth targets, as well as plans to curtail steel output, suggest the fuel has been secured out of an abundance of caution that could end up pressuring prices, limiting any windfall to Australia’s miners.</p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>The signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company in India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), and France’s leading energy oil and gas firm, TotalEnergies, as recently tweeted by the French company, may open the way for a renewed push by Western companies in China’s arch rival in the Far East. This, in turn, might begin to shift momentum back into the US’s longstanding plans for India to act as a key counterbalance to China’s ever-increasing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
        <p>The MoU between TotalEnergies and ONGC is geared towards the initial exploration of deepwater blocks, especially in and around Mahanadi and Andaman off India’s east coast, according to the French company’s tweet. Towards this end, ONGC last year also signed a heads of agreement with U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil for deepwater exploration on India’s east and west coasts. This latter deal will focus on the exploration of the Krishna Godavari and Cauvery Basins in the eastern offshore area and the Kutch-Mumbai region in the western offshore. According to ONGC’s director of exploration, Shri Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, the collaboration between it and ExxonMobil is likely to last for many years and will be a key part of ONGC’s ability to ensuring energy security for India.</p>
        <p>These long-term strategic energy partnerships between flagship Western oil companies and India are precisely what the U.S. had envisioned back in 2019 when it was putting together its ‘relationship normalisation deals’ initiative. This initiative had originated in the aftermath of the U.S.’s unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or colloquially, ‘the nuclear deal’) in May 2018, as analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets. From that point, Israel’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear program escalated and the U.S. knew that any major attack by Israel against Iran could well be a catalyst for a broader conflict across the entire Middle East. This, in turn, could eventually draw China and Russia as key sponsors of Iran into direct opposition to the US, a key sponsor of Israel. The U.S. also knew that several of its remaining allies in the Middle East shared Israel’s fear about Iranian intentions following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. In an attempt to counterbalance these fears, the administration under then-U.S. President Donald Trump came up with the relationship normalisation deals initiative. On 13 August 2020, it was announced that Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would normalise relations in a deal that had been brokered by the US – the first of the relationship normalisation deals program.</p>
        <p>For the program to work effectively for the long term, though, the U.S. needed a substitute big buyer of energy to China be found that could form a unified oil and gas supply and demand network with the US and its allies at the centre, rather than China and Russia. Both Beijing and Moscow were targeting the same countries as the U.S., with the exception of Iran, and had two significant advantages over the U.S. in attracting politically wavering Middle Eastern countries to their sphere of influence. First, Russia was the key player – alongside Saudi Arabia – in the ‘OPEC+’ oil supply alliance. Second, China was the big buyer in the global oil demand pool. Therefore, the U.S. posited, the substitute buyer for China had to be big and full of promise, and the obvious candidate was India.</p>
        <p>India’s role as the US counterpoint to China in the Indo-Pacific region was further underlined by data released in the first quarter of 2021 by the IEA. This showed that India would make up the biggest share of energy demand growth - at 25 percent - over the next two decades, as it overtook the European Union as the world’s third-biggest energy consumer by 2030. India’s energy consumption was expected to nearly double as the nation’s GDP expanded to an estimated USD8.6 trillion by 2040 under its national policy scenario. This was underpinned by a rate of GDP growth that added the equivalent of another Japan to the world economy by 2040, according to the IEA. Politically as well, there had been several developments – also analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets – that pointed to India finally making substantive progress on its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy as an alternative to China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative.</p>
        <p>The U.S.’s vision of the intertwining of the relationship normalisation deals initiative with the economic and political development of India was initially illustrated through an early series of major oil deals between the UAE and India. Perhaps the most notable of these was the landmark decision by India that allowed the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to export oil from the country’s vitally-important strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) if there was no domestic demand for it. This was in line with ADNOC being the only overseas company allowed to hold and store any part of India’s SPR. Another sign of the UAE and India developments moving in the way that the U.S. wanted for its ‘relationship normalisation deals’ model was ADNOC being put ‘top of the list’ of foreign companies being considered as the lead buyer in the high-profile privatisation of major Indian refiner, Bharat Petroleum. Russian state corporate proxy, Rosneft, had expressed an interest in buying the Indian government’s 53.29 percent stake in the company at that time but had been subsequently side-lined by ADNOC.</p>
        <p>Since then, and especially in light of India’s equivocal stance on Russia just before and after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, questions have remained on which way India will jump in the reordering of the global oil markets that is currently underway. However, with the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer, currently shipping in over 85% of its oil from overseas, India still remains in play as far as the West is concerned. The country is recovering economically from the effects of COVID-19 at a  slower pace than had been expected and is therefore looking to monetise its oil and gas resources as quickly as possible to minimise energy import costs. ExxonMobil’s prime position in several major sites and TotalEnergies’ new MoU have significantly bolstered the existing presence of Western firms in India to take advantage of this situation. September 2022 saw ONGC sign another agreement, with Chevron New Ventures (a subsidiary of U.S. energy giant, Chevron), to assess exploration potential in India. This deal is geared towards exploring the geologically challenging and difficult developments in Category-I, II and III of India’s sedimentary basins.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Despite ongoing market volatility and a sluggish start to 2023, the price of gold and silver continues to outperform on Wall Street while maintaining an upward trend towards historic highs.</p>
        <p>A Kitco News' online survey showed gold could top out at a record $2,100 an ounce in 2023, and silver could jump more than 50% to reach $38 an ounce this year. However, since Jan. 1, gold has only recorded modest gains, as silver backpedaled beneath the redline over the same time.</p>
        <p>The price of gold futures peaked at $2,014.90 on Monday before quickly retreating below the $2,000 marker, while silver continues to rally strong in recent weeks, rising roughly 4% the last month and another 3.1% the last week.</p>
        <p>In an interview with FOX Business, Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, said, "Both gold and silver added 15% to 20% over the last six months, while the overall market was in the range of 2% to 4% growth."</p>
        <p>"Things are just starting to heat up," he added. "In fact, the long-term projections in the precious metals market could get even higher."</p>
        <p>"And regardless of the Fed's position, few Americans have faith that the U.S. dollar will strengthen, providing a strong case for allocating a portion of funds to a tangible and secure asset," Rose added.</p>
        <p>Year-to-date, the U.S. dollar has slipped roughly 0.27% and is now just $0.93 of the euro and $0.82 of the pound sterling.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve will announce another interest rate decision on Wednesday, after the latest bump placed rates in the range of 4.5% to 4.75%, notching the highest mark since 2007 and the eighth consecutive increase.</p>
        <p>The interest rate hike in February followed a half-point jump in December and four 75-basis-point hikes earlier in 2022.</p>
        <p>Rose said in light of several major banking institutions failing over the last few weeks, "you now have the government and Fed claiming they can orchestrate a soft landing."</p>
        <p>"No one knows exactly what will happen in the future," he rebutted. "Historically speaking, you would be hard-pressed to find a more consistent option than precious metals to place your hard-earned money when the economy is crashing."</p>
        <p>According to Morgan Stanley, "The volatility of silver prices can be two to three times greater than that of gold on a given day," due to the silver market being much smaller than the yellow metal’s, resulting in lower market liquidity.</p>
        <p>However, silver’s increasing applications in industry could begin closing the gap in 2023, particularly as the automotive sector makes greater shifts to electric, and alternate forms of energy are harnessed through solar.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, gold remains the enduring metal on Wall Street because of its connection to currency alongside supply and demand factors, despite being primarily used in industry for its properties as a conductor in electronics manufacturing in both the aerospace and defense.</p>

        <p>Gold bugs have been waiting for this moment. The precious metal touched $2,000 an ounce on Monday amid a wobbly banking sector, elevated inflation, and expectations of a 25 basis point rate hike (or none at all) at the next Fed meeting.</p>
        <p>“When things get scary out there, investors run to safe havens, and gold is basically one of those major safe havens,” Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Inthemoneystocks.com and verifiedinvesting.com.</p>
        <p>Gold futures (GC=F) are up 6% since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the closure of Signature Bank of New York spurred concerns of a banking contagion. Europe’s Credit Suisse debacle also sent investors into assets like bitcoin and precious metals.</p>
        <p>“We have seen kind of a flee from the banking system," said Soloway. “Money absolutely did move away into gold and that’s definitely one of those fear-factor trades that has helped gold go higher."</p>
        <p>“Recent price gains have likely sapped some of the support for a further rally, even though the Fed is likely closer to their peak interest rate and the U.S. dollar may weaken further," Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle told Yahoo Finance. "That said, the trend is likely to remain higher, especially as demand from Asia recovers as China reopens this year."</p>
        <p>While gold bulls see the precious metal going past its previous record high of $2,074.88 some time before the end of 2023, the real fireworks are expected next year.</p>
        <p>“By 2024, I would actually say we’ll get well above $3,000, maybe $3500,” said Soloway, who expects prices to reach $2,100 by the end of this year. “2024 will be the big year for gold. That’s going to be the monster up year.”</p>
        <p>The future also looks bright for mining stocks, he said. Those underperformed last year as the costs to mine rose, but prices for the underlying metal did not.</p>
        <p>"We will see inflation that is somewhat lightly elevated, but it's not going to be at the levels that it was over the last year or so, and with gold really starting to play catchup, the miners are going to do really well over the next couple of years," said Soloway.</p>

        <p>Oil prices appear to have taken a break from focusing on macro events, with increasing demand and disruptions in supply pushing oil prices higher at the start of the week. The real news for oil markets this week, however, will come from the Fed's meeting.</p>
        <p>- As French strikes are moving into their third week and at least four refineries are winding down operations due to blocked ports and overflowing stocks, Europe’s diesel woes are making a counter-seasonal comeback.</p>
        <p>- French refining, recording 990,000 b/d in the last reported month of January 2023, is heavily geared towards diesel, but cannot meet the country’s hefty 850,000 b/d demand for the product.</p>
        <p>- Consequently, the spread between the prompt and second month of Europe’s diesel benchmark contract, the ICE low-sulfur diesel, rose to a premium of $35 per barrel, the highest since November 2022.</p>
        <p>- France might be the epicenter of the diesel squeeze because the blockage of import terminals across the country is limiting diesel importers from buying products, with diesel imports falling 50% this month compared to February.</p>
        <h3>Market Movers</h3>
        <p>- US LNG developer Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) has reached a final investment decision for the 13.5 mtpa capacity Phase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG project in Texas, estimating costs at $13 billion.</p>
        <p>- Italian oil major ENI (BIT:ENI) made a new 200 million-barrel discovery with its Yatzil exploration well in Mexico’s offshore Block 7, hitting 40m of net oil pay some 40 miles off the coast.</p>
        <p>- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) conglomerate sped up its pace of stock buybacks, having already repurchased more than $1.8 billion of its stock in 2023 to date, suggesting the company is still undervalued.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, March 21, 2023</p>
        <p>Having survived the macro mayhem of last week, oil prices have marginally rebounded this week, with ICE Brent climbing toward $75 per barrel again. The perennial bulls have started to discuss the commodity supercycle again, while the UN published yet another report of a “ticking climate bomb”. For a second it might even feel like a return to the idyllic past when only supply and demand mattered. However, that feeling will likely be a brief one as the Fed starts its two-day meeting on Tuesday, potentially creating another downside factor for prices.</p>
        <p><strong>US Oil Exports Hit Record Highs.</strong>US crude exports are set for an all-time high this month, with outflows to Europe averaging 2.1 million b/d so far as wide discounts for the WTI benchmark and a significantly lower domestic refining pull compel oil producers to export as much as they can.</p>
        <p><strong>G7 Holds Back on Price Cap Revision.</strong>The G7 group is reportedly not seeking to revise the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil this week, three months after it came into effect on December 05, claiming there is no appetite among the members to alter policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Gold Spikes to 1-Year High.</strong>Gold prices have spiked to their highest level since March 2022 this week on the back of banking collapses and a redirection of capital into safe-haven assets, hitting $2,009 per ounce in the Monday session, only to subside somewhat on</p>
        <p><strong>French Refinery Disruptions Get Worse.</strong>Four out of France’s six refineries, a total of 883,000 b/d of refining capacity, are poised to halt operations this week as nationwide protests against President Macron’s decision to increase the retirement age to 64 years spiral out of control.</p>
        <p><strong>Chevron Tanker Collides with Sanctioned Vessel.</strong>The Kerala oil tanker, chartered by US oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to transport some of its heavy Venezuelan crude at the Bajo Grande terminal, collided with Bueno, a sanctioned vessel that had carried Iranian oil in the past, in Venezuelan waters.</p>
        <p><strong>UK Oil Workers to Start Striking.</strong>Some 1,400 offshore workers brought together by the Unite trade union intend to strike across UK oil production sites within weeks, demanding better pay and work conditions, impacting output from fields operated by BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:SHEL), and others.</p>
        <p><strong>LME Suffers Another Scandal.</strong>Less than a year has passed since the LME’s nickel trading debacle, and the metal exchange has now found bags of stones instead of the nickel that was supposed to underpin some of its contracts at a warehouse in Rotterdam, dealing another blow to the 146-year-old exchange.</p>
        <p><strong>Indigenous Protests Hinder Ecuador Production.</strong>Protests by indigenous communities in Ecuador’s Oriente jungle have forced the country’s national oil firm Petroecuador to declare force majeure on production there, aggravated by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake that triggered power outages.</p>
        <p><strong>Mexico to Punish Its Own Refiner.</strong>The state authorities of the Nuevo Leon state in Mexico warned they would penalize national oil company Pemex for a dramatic increase in emissions coming out of its Cadereyta refinery, responsible for 90% of sulfur dioxide emissions in and around Monterrey.</p>
        <p><strong>BP Eyes Chinese CCUS Projects.</strong>UK energy major BP (NYSE:BP) signed an agreement with China’s state-owned oil company PetroChina (SHA:601857) to build a carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) cluster in the country’s Hainan province, potentially storing some 1 million tons CO2.</p>
        <p><strong>Exxon Wants to Get More Out of Mozambique.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong>Having shelved the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique after an Islamic State insurgency, US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is now looking to revive the project and increase its production capacity from the initial 15.2mtpa to 18mtpa.</p>
        <p><strong>Venezuelan Oil Minister Resigns.</strong>Venezuela’s oil minister Tareck El Aissami handed in his resignation this week after a corruption investigation into the operation of state oil company PDVSA by its new boss unearthed serious acts of corruption, linked to the disappearance of $3-5 billion in cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p><strong>EU Wants to Extend Gas Cut Mandates.</strong>The European Commission proposed an extension of gas consumption mandates for EU member states to have gas demand cut by 15% for another 12 months, wary that natural gas markets remain tight despite the exceptionally warm winter.</p>

        <p>High inflation, a banking crisis, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions; it’s no wonder gold is finding a bid. Is this rally going to fade or is it signal of what is to come?</p>
        <p>Gold is a bit of an oddball asset and is shrouded by conspiracy and half-truths. While commonly regarded as an inflation hedge, it doesn’t actually correlate very well with the rate of inflation. In 2022, we saw that during the worst bout of inflation in 50 years, gold prices were unchanged over the year. Nonetheless, gold has continuously grinded higher over the last two decades in line with the expansion of central bank balance sheets.</p>
        <p>Gold, while not a great stand-alone investment can provide some valuable portfolio diversification. Its returns are generally quite lumpy, but often provides standout performance during periods of very high market stress.</p>
        <h3>Technical Setup</h3>
        <p>A long-term price chart of gold futures shows a compelling technical chart pattern has developed over the last 10 years. A prototypical cup and handle pattern indicates there may be more room to run for the yellow metal.</p>
        <p>A monthly close above $2000 signals a breakout that can extend to $2400, although a reversal back into the range would invalidate the setup.</p>
        <h3>Barrick Gold</h3>
        <p>Barrick Gold GOLD, based in Toronto, Canada, is the largest gold mining company in the world. GOLD has many advanced exploration and development projects located across five continents. The company produced 4.1 million ounces of gold in 2022 and has 76 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.</p>
        <p>Barrick Gold currently earns a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a mixed earnings revision trend. We can see that the current and next quarter have seen some small revisions lower, but the current year and next year are looking higher. Furthermore, the major factor determining Barrick’s returns are going to be the price of gold. Thus, if we see continued strength in gold prices, Barrick should follow.</p>
        <p>So far this year Barrick Gold is up 8% and trading in line with the underlying commodity. Over the last year GOLD stock is down -22% considerably underperforming gold.</p>
        <p>GOLD is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 20x, which is below the industry average of 22x and below its own five-year median of 21x. Additionally, Barrick Gold has a dividend yield of 2.3%, and has raised its dividend an average of 30% annually over the last five years. Barrick Gold’s dividend yield can make the stock more compelling than the underlying commodity because gold has no cash flow.</p>
        <h3>Yamana Gold</h3>
        <p>Yamana Gold AUY is another Canada based gold producer. It operates both gold and copper exploration and development sites in North America, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years Yamana Gold stock has performed quite well, outperforming both its respective industry and the broad market. AUY also offers a dividend yield of 2%, which it has increased by an average of 44% annually over the last three years.</p>
        <p>AUY boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Over the last 60 days analysts have raised earnings expectations for all future earnings periods.</p>
        <p>The company’s EPS surprised to the upside by 25% last quarter. Additionally, AUY has a history of beating earnings expectations having missed only once over the last five years.</p>
        <p>Currently trading at 19x one-year forward earnings AUY is above its three-year median of 17x, and below the industry average of 22x.</p>
        <h3>Additional Picks</h3>
        <p>There are two additional options for adding exposure to gold. The first is through the most popular gold ETF GLD, which does a good job of tracking the underlying price of gold.</p>
        <p>The second option is the gold miners ETF GDX. This ETF holds a portfolio of gold mining companies like the ones featured here. GDX is generally more volatile than the underlying commodity, which can be great if you time it correctly with a rally, or painful if the timing is poor.</p>
        <p>With Gold breaking out above $2000 there is no doubt that we are going through unprecedented times. Even if you aren’t trading gold as it stands now, at the least it can be used as an indication of the state of capital markets. If investors are reaching for gold, you can assume uncertainty is on the rise.</p>

        <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices retreated from their highest level in a year in volatile trading on Monday, as share markets and Treasury yields bounced back on central banks' efforts to shore up confidence in the financial sector.</p>
        <p>Spot gold dipped 0.5% to $1,977.18 per ounce by 1:57 p.m. EDT (1757 GMT), after sliding over 1%, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to settle at $1,982.80.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the session, prices of the yellow metal had climbed 1% to their highest since March 2022 at $2,009.59, just shy of a record set during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>"While emergency efforts are being done... now you're seeing that this is far from over. Safe-haven flows are fairly going to be the key trade," Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said.</p>
        <p>In an effort to help the banking sector, top central banks moved on Sunday to bolster the flow of cash around the world.</p>

        <p>After wild swings, gold showed a strong rebound last week. SPDR Gold Shares GLD added more than 4% last week and 7.3% past month. The subdued U.S. dollar and a decline in U.S. treasury bond yields bolstered the demand for the yellow metal. Additionally, the demand for inflation hedge and growing recession fears are driving investors toward gold, as it is considered a safe haven.</p>
        <p>As such, gold ETF rallied over the last week with GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR, iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Strategy ETF IAUF, and Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF SGOL gaining about 5% each.</p>
        <h3>Factors Driving Gold Price</h3>
        <p>The combination of factors is acting as a catalyst for gold price. Wall Street has been witnessing high volatility lately due to failures of regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank. While First Republic Bank secured a $30 billion rescue package from other big banks, its fate is still unclear.</p>
        <p>The crisis spread to the global market. And European banking behemoth Credit Suisse is also operating at the edge. The flagship Swiss lender's shares nosedived on fears of a debt default. Finally, UBS has purchased the struggling Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in a historic deal. Such crisis has every reason for a flight to safety, which has bolstered the demand for safe haven asset gold.</p>
        <p>In fact, other safe assets like U.S. treasuries gained too, dragging down bond yields. As U.S. treasury yields dropped last week, the greenback has lost its strength. The U.S. benchmark treasury yield started the month at 4.01%, hit a high of 4.08% and ended last week at 3.39%. Traders expect the Fed to raise its benchmark lending rate this week but by a smaller margin of a 25 bps. A decline in bond yields went in favor of non-interest-paying assets like gold.</p>
        <p>If the pace of Fed rate hike slows, the U.S. dollar is likely to decline ahead. If the greenback falls, gold prices will gain as the metal is priced in the U.S. dollar. Moreover, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the East Europe and tensed relationship between United States and China may boost the safe-haven status of gold.</p>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>The gold’s rally from here depends on the Fed’s behavior and the government’s ability to tackle the banking crisis. If the U.S. economic growth slows materially, jobs market suffers and the banking crisis deepens, the Fed will likely be staying put in the coming months. This would be a good new for gold investing. Gold investors should closely watch the economic and market events before taking any decision.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Gold slipped after earlier rising above $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year as a deal to buy Credit Suisse Group AG failed to fully ease fears over the global banking sector.</p>
        <p>The haven earlier rose as much as 1% despite regulators worldwide rushing to shore up market confidence over the weekend. The ongoing banking woes are also spurring bets that central banks may embark on a slower pace of monetary tightening.</p>
        <p>Read More: UBS to Buy Credit Suisse in $3 Billion Deal to Fight Crisis</p>
        <p>Bullion surged 6.5% last week in its biggest advance since early on in the pandemic after several regional American lenders collapsed and concerns grew over the Swiss bank’s health.</p>
        <p>“The treatment of AT1 bonds has introduced a new source of uncertainty,” Marcus Garvey, head of metals strategy at Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note. “The longer uncertainty rolls on, with neither market fears being wholly calmed nor a full-blown systematic crisis unfolding, the higher gold prices should be able to trade.”</p>
        <p>It’s a sharp turnaround for bullion, which slid last month on expectations the Federal Reserve would continue its aggressive monetary tightening to curb inflation. Those bets have since been greatly diminished, with swaps traders now split on whether the central bank will hike again this year.</p>
        <p>That’s a boon for non-yielding gold, and investors have responded by increasing their allocations to the market. In tonnage terms, exchange-traded fund holdings of the metal rose the most since April last week, according to an initial tally by Bloomberg.</p>
        <p>All eyes will now shift to the Fed’s two-day meeting that culminates Wednesday, “where the outcome is going to be the most difficult to predict in years,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. A shift to a more dovish outlook from policymakers at a time when inflation remains hot could push gold even higher.</p>
        <p>Spot gold fell 0.5% to $1,978.64 an ounce as of 12:20 p.m. in New York, after earlier climbing as high as $2,009.73. The last time bullion traded above the $2,000 mark was in March 2022. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was 0.4% lower. Silver and palladium dropped, while platinum gained.</p>
        <p>Copper traded on the London Metal Exchange advanced as risk appetite improved moderately. Most other base metals were higher.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Many commodities remained under pressure in the wake of UBS Group AG’s emergency purchase of Credit Suisse Group AG that aims to contain a banking crisis hurting the appeal of risk assets.</p>
        <p>Oil sank, with the US benchmark plunging below $65 a barrel to the lowest since late 2021. Grains fell and European gas hit the lowest in more than 1 1/2 years, though copper rose amid a mixed session for industrial metals. Gold — which benefited from the banking turmoil with a 6.5% surge last week — eased after topping $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year on haven demand.</p>
        <p>After reaching a record last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Bloomberg Commodities Spot Index has dropped by more than a quarter as concerns over a global slowdown, higher interest rates, and a huge selloff in natural gas dragged the gauge lower. The upheaval in the banking sector — marked by the swift collapse of several US lenders and subsequent crisis at Credit Suisse — then deepened the rout, although bullion was a beneficiary.</p>
        <p>With a crisis of confidence threatening to spread across financial markets, the Swiss government brokered the deal for Credit Suisse over the weekend, including a guarantee for potential losses from the assets UBS is taking over. The Federal Reserve and five other central banks also announced coordinated action to boost liquidity in US dollar swap arrangements to ease strains in the financial system.</p>
        <p>Following those efforts, financial markets came under further pressure early Monday before equities started to fare better.</p>
        <p>“When banking suffers then credit suffers and then the economy suffers,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB. “So less optimism on economic growth is warranted.”</p>
        <p>The trajectory for raw materials this week will mostly hinge on how the Credit Suisse deal is received, as well as on the outcome of the Fed’s rate decision on Wednesday. Although US policy makers had signaled their willingness to raise rates by 50 basis points to contain still-hot inflation before the banking crisis erupted, market watchers now expect a smaller increase, or perhaps even a pause.</p>
        <p>The worries over the banking sector have prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — one of the most bullish banks on crude — to trim its forecasts, with the lender no longer seeing prices at $100 in the year ahead. That’s even with it now expecting OPEC producers to only increase output in the third quarter of 2024, rather than in the second half of 2023.</p>
        <p>Oil Spread Slumps Most Since January in Latest Sign of Weakness</p>
        <p>“Participants are still not fully convinced on whether recent moves by authorities can backstop further banking fallouts,” said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte in Singapore. Investors are now wondering whether to buy the dip, Yeap said.</p>
        <p>Bullion’s Appeal</p>
        <p>Gold’s jump last week was its biggest since the early days of the pandemic. Heading into the latest banking crisis, precious metals were dramatically under-owned after a big selloff in February, said Ole Sloth Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. A shift to a more dovish outlook from Fed policy makers would benefit non-yielding bullion.</p>
        <p>In other commodities, iron ore fell after Chinese regulators renewed warnings to companies against hoarding and price gouging in response to a recent surge in the steel-making material. Wheat retreated after the renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to ship rains and other crops from key Black Sea ports, although there was uncertainty over the length of the agreement.</p>

        <p>(Bloomberg) -- Global coal consumption will likely peak by next year as economics and climate strategies shift the world toward cleaner energy, but several wild cards could determine how long the dirtiest fossil fuel persists, according to BloombergNEF.</p>
        <p>Coal power generation increased in each of the past two years as China and India battled electricity shortages and Europe tried to replace Russian natural gas. BNEF modeled two scenarios — a purely economic one and one driven by policies to reach net zero emissions by 2050 — both of which see demand rise to a record next year before declining.</p>
        <p>Under both scenarios there are several wild cards that could affect how slowly or rapidly use of the fossil fuel declines. These include stronger-than-expected power demand, social backlash against the loss of mining jobs and lobbying from plant owners. China’s clean energy policies, economic support for poorer nations’ energy transitions and prices are other key factors.</p>
        <p>BloombergNEF sees coal use persisting through the middle of the century even under strong net zero policies, where demand in the power sector would fall about 70% from its 2024 peak to 1.5 billion tons a year and require plants equipped with carbon capture systems to keep emissions at bay. That would require massive investments in the technology, which has struggled to prove it can operate commercially at scale.</p>
        <p>Coal production has outpaced demand over the past two years, as top miners China and India lifted output to help battle power shortages. That led to a surge in inventories by the end of 2022, especially in China.</p>
        <p>The report also highlights a rocky road ahead for the seaborne thermal coal trade. While production increased for domestic use in China and India, miners in exporters including Australia and the US have ramped down investments to avoid being stuck with stranded assets. That could create a supply squeeze if demand in importing countries rises.</p>
        <p>“A supply crunch in the seaborne thermal coal market could raise coal prices and make it less competitive in the power sector in coal-importing countries and hence accelerate the fall of coal consumption around the world,” BloombergNEF said in the report.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p><strong>Southern Copper Corporation</strong>SCCO is poised well for growth, backed by its industry-leading copper reserves, focus on increasing low-cost production and ongoing investment in expansion projects. Its cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.</p>
        <h3>Output to Pick Up 2023 Onwards</h3>
        <p>In 2022, the company registered a 6.6% year-over-year decline in copper production to 894,703 tons, due to work stoppage at the Cuajone mine as well as lower ore grades. Molybdenum production was 13.3% down to 26,240 tons as a result of lower ore grades at the Toquepala mine. Zinc production was down 10.4% year over year to 60,010 tons due to lower production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara mines. Mined silver production was 18.56 million ounces, down 2.1% from last year. This was mainly due to a decline in production at Peruvian operations and the La Caridad mine which was partially offset by higher production at Buenavista and IMMSA mines.</p>
        <p>These numbers are expected to pick up and reach 926,000 tons in 2023. This will be made possible by the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production on projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrators.</p>
        <h3>Solid Projects on Track</h3>
        <p>Southern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion, including the Michiquillay ($2.5 billion) and Los Chancas ($2.6 billion) projects. Peru is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. Production is expected to commence by 2032.</p>
        <p>The Los Chancas project located in Apurimac, Peru is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of the concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The project is expected to commence in 2030.</p>
        <p>The company has a number of other projects that are planned to be developed in the future, which will help in attaining its copper volume production target of 1.5 million tons by 2031.</p>
        <h3>Metal Prices to Pick Up in the Long Term</h3>
        <p>Copper prices had been on a downtrend in 2022 amid uncertainties surrounding the global economy, as new coronavirus restrictions in China affected the demand for the red metal, thus hurting prices. Zinc prices also bore the brunt of weak demand worries as COVID lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Silver prices had also been negatively impacted, weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth.</p>
        <p>Industrial production in China has lagged expectations for the first two months of this year while political unrest in South America is fueling supply concerns. This has been weighing on copper prices lately.</p>
        <p>The long-term outlook for copper is positive, as copper demand is expected to grow, driven by electric vehicles and renewable energy, and infrastructure investments. Copper prices will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States, as well as global initiatives to address climate change.</p>
        <p>Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand and reduced supply. Long-term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption. Silver prices will gain eventually, given its industrial use, impending demand-supply imbalance and safe-haven demand.</p>
        <h3>Industry Leading Reserves & Low Cost: A Winning Combination</h3>
        <p>Southern Copper has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates high-quality, world-class assets in investment-grade countries such as Mexico and Peru. Backed by its constant focus on increasing low-cost production and growth investments, the company is well-poised to continue delivering enhanced performance. Its efforts to lower costs have aided the company to negate the impacts of higher costs for diesel and fuel, operating and repair materials, supplies and energy, as well as higher labor costs.</p>
        <h3>Price Performance</h3>
        <p>The company’s shares have fallen 2.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s 14% growth.</p>
        <h3>Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider</h3>
        <p>Southern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
        <p>Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, Olympic Steel Inc. ZEUS and Nucor Corporation NUE.</p>
        <p>Steel Dynamics currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). STLD’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 11.3% on average. STLD has rallied around 23.2% in a year.</p>
        <p>Olympic Steel currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. ZEUS’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 26.2% on average. ZEUS has rallied around 51.7% in a year.</p>
        <p>Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). NUE’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 7.7% on average. NUE has rallied around 20.5% in a year.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>In the case of OPEC, cutting back on oil supplies doesn't do much for boosting prices when demand isn't there.</p>
        <p>The OPEC put, just like the Fed put, is nothing other than a fallacy, or perhaps wishful thinking at this point. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Brent oil spiked to $130 a barrel plus, money rushed into the oil sector as we heard doom-and-gloom calls about a lack of energy capital spending, running out of spare capacity, and how oil prices would need to be higher for longer to spur that investment.</p>
        <p>True as some of those calls may be, commodities don't work that way. They are driven by actual demand and supply at any given time and by the inventory balance. Of course, academics and analysts tend to move their models at extremes to price in the latest scenario. But trading does not care about research-driven models. After all, if we believed research-driven models, Tesla (TSLA) was supposed to trade at $1.500.</p>
        <p>It is easy to tweak an Excel model to spit out whatever confirmation bias you may have, or play with the denominator to generate the result one wants to see. Assumptions are very important in any modeling, and that is where the problem lies. Most models get demand entirely wrong.</p>
        <p>After the rout in technology stocks in 2022, most investors parked their money in what they deemed as safe haven assets, such as large-cap equites that showed 4%-5% yield on their balance sheets. But those very same dividend yields are subject to cash flows, and if the top line erodes, so do those cash flows. A stock needs to give an investor the right upside reward potential for the risk the investor takes to invest in that equity. But if US government bonds yielded the same coupon as a risky equity, one would be better suited to be invested in the former.</p>
        <p>Just as we saw in natural gas markets when prices got to as high as 300 euros per megawatt hour and most called for Europe to be sent back to the dark ages, lo and behold, the physical market finds a way as there are entrepreneurs who will find a way to capitalize on these arbitrage opportunities. US liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies did just that as they profited from the massive $10/MMBtu vs. $2/MMBtu differential by sending all their cargoes to Europe as Europe was desperate.</p>
        <p>European gas today is trading below 45 euros per MWh and politicians are still debating energy and gas security. The oil market is slightly different in that we have had OPEC and Russia working together to balance the market, supporting prices so to speak. This only works when the market is tight and you are the only swing producer, i.e. in 2021. But today, demand is not as strong despite China reopening its economy, and there is no need for additional barrels. When demand is weak and supply picks up, there is nothing much that can be done to support prices.</p>
        <p>Oil equity investors held onto their long oil bets all throughout 2022 as they hoped for China's return or Russian barrels to come off the market. Neither has happened. Oil prices are down 50%-plus as analysts who assumed $90 a barrel was the floor for oil are seeing less than $75 a barrel now. One forgets that we were trading below $75 a barrel before Covid.</p>
        <p>The same wishful thinking is heard in the equity market as most retail investors think Fed will come to their rescue as it did in the past decade and start quantitative easing (QE) again. But what the Fed and OPEC have in common is that they never had to deal with a harsh recession and higher inflation at the same time. Both have their hands tied for now, for if they were to either print more money (in the case of Fed) or cut back on supplies (OPEC), it could cause a price surge, but only in the short term, as that would collapse the global economy as we know it, sending it back even worse than the 1970s.</p>

        <p>HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. is considering selling its majority stake in the Rovigo LNG terminal offshore Italy as part of a strategy to divest from non-core assets, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The terminal, also named, Adriatic LNG, is owned by Exxon's subsidiary ExxonMobil Italiana Gas S.r.l. (70.7%), QatarEnergy subsidiary Qatar Terminal Company Limited (22%) and Snam Spa (7.3%). Snam has the right of first refusal should a partner decide to divest.</p>
        <p>Exxon said that while it was verifying market interest, it had not made a decision about a potential sale nor has it identified a buyer at this early stage.</p>
        <p>"Tests like this are consistent with our focused investment strategy, highlighting our willingness to divest non-core assets to those who can derive greater value," Exxon spokesperson Meghan Macdonald said.</p>
        <p>Any transaction would not impact Exxon's imports of LNG into the Adriatic LNG terminal, nor its interest in the Italian and European markets as a natural gas supplier, the company said.</p>

          <li>The EU will expand its liquefied natural gas import capacity to help ease supply bottlenecks.</li>
          <li>The bloc has also encouraged bloc companies to not enter any further LNG agreements with Russia.</li>
          <li>Despite trying to wean away from Russian supplies, LNG exports from the country increased in 2022.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The European Union is set to increase its liquefied natural gas import volume by almost a third in a continued move to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies.</p>
        <p>Maros Sefcovic, vice president of the European Commission, tweeted on Thursday that the union was gearing up to add eight more LNG regasification terminals in the next year, up from 27 existing facilities.</p>
        <p>The extra infrastructure will help alleviate bottleneck concerns that the 27-member bloc experienced in the past year and provide the continent with more LNG for the future. The move will increase its regasification capacity from 178 to 227 billion cubic meters, Sefcovic tweeted.</p>
        <p>The announcement comes alongside remarks from European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson, directing European companies not to enter any new LNG trade deals with Russia, as the continent tries to completely shed Russian energy exports by 2027.</p>
        <p>"I encourage all member states and all companies to stop buying Russian LNG, and not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia once the existing contracts have expired," she said in an EU meeting on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago sparked an energy war as Russia cut off its gas and oil exports to the continent in retaliation for Western sanctions.</p>
        <p>Though the bloc weathered the crisis thanks to a mild winter and increased imports from alternative suppliers, such as the US, it continues to depend on Russian LNG, and imports of the commodity increased by 35% in 2022.</p>
        <p>"We can and should get rid of Russian gas completely as soon as possible, still keeping in mind our security of supply," Simson said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the EU has continued to develop on-sea floating import terminals, or FSRUs, that have allowed it to import LNG from new suppliers without the construction of pipelines.</p>

        <h3>In this article:</h3>
        <p>Shell Plc SHEL, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, has recently withdrawn its involvement in the Salym Petroleum Development in Russia. This marks a significant moment in the company's history, as it has been operating in the region for over two decades.</p>
        <p>The decision to exit the Salym project was made as part of Shell's ongoing strategy to streamline its global portfolio and focus on areas where it can generate maximum returns.</p>
        <p>The company has been divesting its non-core assets and reducing costs in recent years, in order to become more competitive and adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
        <p>Salym Petroleum Development was a joint venture between Shell and Gazprom Neft, with the former holding a 50% interest in the project. The venture was launched in 1996 to develop oil fields in the West Siberian Basin and has since produced over 200 million barrels of oil.</p>
        <p>Despite its success, the Salym project was not considered a strategic asset for Shell, and the decision to divest was made after a comprehensive review of the company's portfolio. The withdrawal was completed on Dec 22, 2022, and the stake was sold to Gazprom Neft for $233 million.</p>
        <p>While the sale of the Salym stake will have a limited impact on Shell's overall production, it is an important step in the company's efforts to simplify its portfolio and focus on areas of higher revenue generation. Shell is currently investing in a range of new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energy and electric vehicle charging, as it seeks transition to a low-carbon future.</p>
        <p>The withdrawal from the Salym project also reflects the broader trend of international oil companies reducing their exposure to Russia, due to political and economic risks. Sanctions imposed by Western countries in response to Russia's Ukraine invasion in 2022 have made it more difficult for foreign companies to do business in the country.</p>
        <p>The withdrawal is also a clear indication of the company's commitment to strategic focus and adaptability in a changing industry. As the energy transition accelerates, companies will need to be proactive in adapting to the new energy landscape.</p>
        <p>Shell, a multinational energy and petrochemical company, headquartered in London, engages in the exploration, extraction, marketing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also produces gas-to-liquid fuels and other products.</p>
