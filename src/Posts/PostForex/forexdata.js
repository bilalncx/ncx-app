	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has rallied significantly during the trading session on Thursday, as we continue to see inflation in the United States cool off, and therefore it’s likely that we continue to see the US dollar drop a bit.</p>
	    <p>This will be the case as traders anticipate that the Federal Reserve may not have to be as aggressive, and with that being the case, I do think that we will continue to go higher.</p>	
	    <p>A short-term pullback should offer buying opportunities, and I do think that you would get those occasionally. However, this is the scenario where the market will continue to go higher given enough time and therefore I think you will eventually see value hunters coming in to pick up this market.</p>	
	    <p>The 1.30 level will continue to be an area of intense focus, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and of course an area that just offered a significant amount of resistance. “Market memory” comes into the picture here, so with that being the case I think you’ve got a situation where the market will find itself testing the resolve of the overall bullish pressure.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the US dollar might be the biggest mover, and therefore I anticipate that the market may continue to go higher, perhaps as high as the 1.3250 level, maybe even the 1.35 level. Because of this, I think that it is only a matter of time before we see value hunters come in on those pullbacks, and therefore I have no interest in shorting this pair.</p>
      <p>I believe it is probably obvious at this point that the US dollar is on its back foot, and it’s obvious also that the British pound has been very strong. I don’t expect to see this changing anytime soon, and therefore I remain bullish of this pair. Ultimately, the market will probably continue to be bullish, but we are getting a little stretched so don’t be surprised at all if you see some type of short-term turnaround.</p>
      <p>As far as selling is concerned, I would need to see the massive trendline broken, something that we are nowhere near doing, and therefore it’s not even a thought at this point.</p>

    	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The Australian dollar has rallied significantly during the trading session on Thursday, blasting through the 0.68 level. This is an area that previously was resistance, and the fact that we have shot through there suggests that the US dollar weakness could continue.</p>
	    <p>This was exacerbated by the CPI numbers on Wednesday coming out lighter than anticipated and suggesting that perhaps the market is going to see slowing inflation. That being said, the market is likely to continue to be very sensitive as traders around the world worry about the central banks and what they are going to be doing. The idea that the Federal Reserve may slow down has certainly weighed upon the US dollar, so this will be interesting.</p>	
	    <p>Just above, the 0.69 level is an area where we have seen a bit of resistance after the previous shot higher. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to open up the possibility of a move to the 0.70 level.</p>
      <p>That being said, we are a little overextended at this point, so a pullback could be coming. Nonetheless, it is a market that has been wildly volatile, due to the fact that the Aussie is not only sensitive to the global growth situation, but it is also very sensitive to commodity markets as well.</p>
      <p>At this point, the US dollar is probably the biggest mover of this market, as we are seeing everybody focusing on the Federal Reserve’s next move, even though everybody already seems to know that there are a couple of rate hikes ahead.</p>
      <p>The question is whether or not traders can be convinced that the Federal Reserve will stay “higher for longer.” Furthermore, the Reserve Bank of Australia has been relatively aggressive as well, so that is another factor in this market.</p>
    	<p>The last couple of candlesticks have been very impulsive, and therefore one would have to assume that there’s a little bit of momentum, but a short-term pullback is probably necessary. Whether or not we can continue remains to be seen, but if we were to clear that 0.69 level, then we could start to see momentum really start to pick up.</p>

    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Thursday, and it looks like we may have a little bit of follow-through. At this point, the market is likely to get looking to the 1.1250 level, an area that of course is a large, round, psychologically significant mid-century range, and an area that in the past has been important previously. If we can break above there, then it’s likely that the market could go to the 1.15 handle.</p>
    	<p>Underneath, the 1.11 level is an area that previously has been resistance and should be supported on any type of pullback. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see plenty of buyers, especially as it seems like the US economy is finally going to see a little bit of relief from the inflationary headwinds.</p>	
    	<p>Granted, we are a little overdone to the upside in the short-term, but it shows that the trend is most certainly to the upside, and it’s probably worth noting that the market had previously formed a massive ascending triangle, and therefore it’s likely that the markets will continue to see technical traders chase this market higher.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, the 50-Day EMA sits right around the 1.09 level, an area that would be short-term support, and perhaps a bit of a “floor in the market.” Underneath there, then the market has to look at the 200-Day EMA as support as well, near the 1.0750 level.</p>
      <p>It’s not until we break down below that level that the trend would change, and therefore it’s likely that you would see a massive selloff if we do break down below there. I don’t expect to see that, but it is something to keep in the back of your mind for longer-term moves.</p>
      <p>In the end, it’s very likely that the euro continues to go higher but may need to pull back a bit in order to build up enough value so the traders will jump into the market and try to take advantage of “cheap euros.” The US dollar is on his back foot against most currencies, so this should continue to be the case going forward.</p>

    	<p>By Sethuraman N R</p>
    	<p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Indian rupee ended higher for a fourth straight session on Thursday, driven by broad weakness in the dollar, while demand for the greenback from importers limited gains.</p>	
    	<p>The rupee ended at 82.0725 against the dollar, after closing at 82.2475 on Wednesday. The currency has risen 0.8% so far this week.</p>	
    	<p>The dollar index declined to 100.22, its lowest since April 2022, after U.S. inflation cooled at a faster-than-expected pace in June with traders now pricing in an end to U.S. interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>The dollar's slide also helped regional currencies such as the Korean won and the Malaysian ringgit to jump more than 1%.</p>
      <p>The bias of traders has now turned towards taking short positions in the dollar, said Dilip Parmar, research analyst at HDFC Securities, adding that the 82 level is acting as a resistance for the rupee.</p>
      <p>A break of the dollar index below 100 can only drive the rupee above 81.80 levels, while the Reserve Bank of India will not let the currency appreciate above that, Parmar said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, rupee forward premiums jumped, with the one-year implied yield jumping to a two-week high of 1.75% intraday. The yield ended at 1.73%, up 10 bps from previous close.</p>
      <p>There may be continued volatility in the rupee market between 81.85-82.90 levels, but three to six months down the line, the rupee is expected to rise towards the 81.25 range as Indian markets have shown a lot of strength in recent times with the dollar index topping out, said, Jateen Trivedi, vice president - research at LKP Securities.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) hit a 15-month high against the dollar on Tuesday as UK wage growth reached a record 7.3%.</p>
    	<p>Sterling was trading at $1.2914, up 0.4% on the day, the highest level since April 2022, while it also climbed 0.4% against the euro (GBPEUR=X) to €1.1731.</p>	
    	<p>Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that average pay rose by 7.3% year-on-year in the quarter to May, the joint-highest reading on record.</p>
      <p>The reading came in stronger than expected, with economists forecasting a small slowdown in pay growth to 7.1%.</p>
      <p>It comes as workers have sought pay rises in order to help keep up with the increased cost of living. However, despite the record increase, pay rises still lag behind inflation which currently stands at 8.7%.</p>
      <p>“With sterling at a 15-month high the value of the overseas earnings which dominate the index is relatively less. The reason for the pound’s move higher is today’s UK jobs data,” Russ Mould at AJ Bell said.</p>
      <p>“While there are some signs the tightness in the labour market is starting to ease, wage growth remains uncomfortably high in the context of the Bank of England’s (BoE) efforts to get surging prices under control.</p>
      <p>“If inflation is like toothpaste, to borrow the well-worn analogy, then the Bank is likely to have to make a big mess of the economy trying to get it back in the tube. Borrowers face more pain with the prospect of further rate hikes to come.”</p>
      <p>Private sector regular pay also rose 7.7% on the same basis, a record high outside the pandemic period, and running well ahead of the BoE’s forecast for growth of 6.3% in Q2.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the UK unemployment rate rose to 4% in the three months to May, up from 3.8% in the previous three months, the ONS added.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: "Our jobs market is strong with unemployment low by historical standards. But we still have around one million job vacancies, pushing up inflation even further.</p>
    	<p>"Our labour market reforms - including expanding free childcare next year — will help to build the high wage, high growth, low inflation economy we all want to see."</p>
      <p>The news causes further concern for the BoE, which is looking to cool the economy and has already warned about a price-earnings spiral.</p>
      <p>Financial markets are predicting that Threadneedle Street is set to hike UK interest rates at its next meeting in August.</p>
      <p>The City is betting there is a 70% chance that rates will rise by another half-point increase from 5% to 5.5%, the highest level since late 2007, while there is a 30% possibility of a smaller, quarter-point increase to 5.25%.</p>
      <p>The bank rate is expected to hit as much as 6% by November, and at least 6.25% by next spring.</p>
      <p>“The pressure on the MPC to continue increasing rates in August will be intense,” Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Monday, as it looks like we are trying to form a bit of a double top. The 1.2650 level is an area underneath it could offer quite a bit of support, and of course we can also have a little bit of support due to the 50-Day EMA at the same time.</p>
    	<p>On the other hand, if the market were to break above the 1.2850 level, then it’s possibly a sign that we are ready to go to the 1.30 level above, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that’s been important in the past.</p>	
    	<p>Keep in mind that the Bank of England has further to go fighting inflation, while people are starting to bet that the Federal Reserve only has 50 more basis points worth of tightening coming. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to be very noisy, and therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see a little bit of a pullback.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I do think that people will look for some type of value on a dip, and therefore it’s worth noting that a lot of traders will probably be looking to take advantage of cheap British pounds.</p>
    	<p>Even if we break down below the 50-Day EMA, there is still a significant amount of noise underneath it that could come into play to offer support, extending all the way down to the 200-Day EMA, which sits at the structurally important 1.2350 level. This is an area that defines the trend, so therefore as long as we can stay above there, we should be in decent shape.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below there, then it’s likely that the British pound will really start to break down, perhaps opening up the possibility of a bullish run for the US dollar. Keep in mind that the risk appetite is still in a state of flux, so that will continue to cause a bit of volatility in this currency pair, as well as many others.</p>

    	<p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Monday, but then gave back gains to show signs of hesitation. Quite frankly, I think this is a market that’s simply trying to pull back in order to find value, or perhaps support so that we can continue the overall drive higher.</p>
    	<p>Remember, the interest rate differential between the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan is very strong, and therefore it’s likely that we could continue to see a lot of buyers coming in to pick up and take advantage of the “swap” at the end of the day, just like the old “carry trade” days that had been so prevalent in the Forex market a few years back.</p>	
    	<p>The ¥180 level underneath is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and therefore I think a lot of people will be paying close attention to it. Furthermore, we had seen a bit of support in that general vicinity a couple of weeks ago, so it all ties together quite nicely. Just below there, we have the 50-Day EMA indicator, which is sitting right around the ¥177 level.</p>	
    	<p>In general, I think this is a situation where you are looking for value, and willing to take advantage of it. Ultimately, I think the market is trying to build up enough momentum to reach the ¥185 level, perhaps even break above their for a longer-term move.</p>
      <p>With the fundamental situation between the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan being so wide, I think it’s possible that we could see the possibility of a move to the ¥200 level. All things being equal, this is a situation where we continue to see a lot of value hunting coming into the market given enough time, but we are a little bit overstretched at this point, and therefore a pullback does make a certain amount of sense. That is in the selling anything it’s change, and I think a lot of people will be looking for “cheap British pounds” to take advantage of. All things being equal, I am bullish but I also recognize that you need to find signs of momentum shifting to the upside.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The euro has gone back and forth during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to hang around the 1.10 level, but cannot seem to break above it. All things being equal, we are in the midst of forming a bit of a bullish flag, but we have not broken out yet therefore you can’t necessarily jump in with both feet. That being said, I think we have a situation where both of these central banks are doing essentially the same thing right now, and that’s causing a bit of stagnation.</p>
	    <p>The European Central Bank is currently worried about inflation, but at the same time is starting to see signs of recession and concern in Germany. The Federal Reserve is expected to do 2 more quarter-point interest rate hikes, but at the same time is starting to see some signs of economic slowing.</p>	
    	<p>In other words, we have a really messy scenario at the moment, and that shows up in the charts as traders are trying to figure out which direction they want to run.</p>	
    	<p>In general, I think we continue to stay in a range bound type of market for a while, as we kicked around the idea of whether or not central banks can diverge. At this point, it doesn’t look that likely so I think we continue to trade this market from a short-term range bound perspective.</p>
      <p>The shorter time frames will probably continue to be the best way to approach this market, especially if you have some type of range bound system that uses an oscillator. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, and therefore position sizing will be everything.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, we will have to have some type of fundamental reason for everything to shift, and until we get that, it’s likely that we will continue to see a lot of back-and-forth. Ultimately, I think this range is what we are stuck in for the foreseeable future and therefore caution is the better part of valor, but you can take advantage of a lot of back-and-forth motion with small positions to slowly build up your account.</p>

	    <p>Because of this, traders are starting to attempt to bet on the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to change its trajectory, which of course is complete nonsense. However, the market is a little overextended so it does make sense that we can see a bit of profit taking at the first signs of trouble.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, we formed a massive bullish flag on the daily chart, which means that somewhere near the ¥140 level, and therefore I think that could be the bottom of the overall pullback.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, I am looking for a bit of value, and that value I will take plenty of advantage of. With that being the case, it is probably only a matter of time before you get the opportunity to start going along again, especially as the swap remains positive for owning this pair, as the Bank of Japan continues to see plenty of reasons to keep its monetary policy loose.</p>
      <p>As long as that’s the case, and the fact that the Federal Reserve is rather tight, it is very likely that we will see more upward pressure than down, although markets don’t go in one direction forever.

Because of this, I think the market will continue to see this as a market that’s trying to break out, but whether or not it is mainly about the overreaction on Friday remains to be seen.</p>	
	    <p>The Non-Farm Payroll number of course came out lighter than anticipated, so that has had a bit of an effect. If we can break out above the recent highs of the last couple of weeks, then it opens up a move to the 1.30 level.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we pull back from here we could look to find support near the 1.2650 level. The market has continued to be very noisy, and therefore I think you got a situation where we are either going to try to work off some of the excess froth, or simply consolidate.</p>
      <p>If we do break above the last couple of weeks, then it’s possible that we could have a run toward that 1.30 level, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. If we break above there, then the market could really continue to go higher.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Bank of England is very tight with its monetary policy, but at the same time the Federal Reserve seems to be going down the same path. There are enough people out there that believe the Fed will have to slow down that we see a little bit of an uptrend.</p>

    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The euro has initially pulled back a bit during the trading week, only to show signs of life. The candlestick ended up forming a bit of a hammer, and therefore looks like we are going to continue to trade in this overall range.</p>
    	<p>All things being equal, the 1.10 level above has offered a little bit of resistance, but if we were to break above there, then we have to deal with the 200-Week EMA, near the 1.11 level.</p>	
    	<p>On the other hand, if we were to break down below the last couple of candlesticks, it’s possible that we could drop down to the 1.08 level, maybe even down to the 50-Week EMA. All things being equal, this is a market that is going to continue to see a lot of noise due to the fact that both central banks are relatively tight, and therefore people are trying to read what they will do in the future via statements and innuendo.</p>	
    	<p>It is probably also worth noting that we are between the 200-Week EMA and the 50-Week EMA, so that means we more likely than not will technical traders as well. In general, this is a situation where we are trying to figure out where we are going to go for a longer-term move, and therefore I think we have quite a bit of volatility ahead of us.</p>
      <p>I think short-term trading is probably more likely than not going to be the case, so longer-term traders will probably have to look at the market from a short-term stance, at least until we can break out of one of the moving averages for a bigger move.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The US dollar has initially tried to rally during the session on Monday, but it looks as if we are struggling just a bit to continue going higher. That does make a certain amount of sense, due to the fact that we are overstretched, and it could pull back toward the ¥142.50 level.</p>
	    <p>This is an area that has a lot of market memory attached to it, so I think at this point it’s likely that we will continue to see that area attract a lot of inflow. Furthermore, we recently had a bullish flag kickoff, and therefore it makes quite a bit of sense since we continue to see upward pressure.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA sits at the top of the flag, and is rising quite rapidly. The ascending triangle before there was also a strong sign of bullish pressure, with the ¥138 level being massive support. Both of them have a “measured move” toward the ¥148 level, and I do think that it makes quite a bit of sense that we eventually get there.</p>	
    	<p>After all, the interest rate differential between the United States and Japan remains very wide, and that will continue to attract a lot of attention. With that being the case, I think you need to look at this from a prism of trying to find support and value occasionally, as we have gotten a little overdone, therefore we need to see a bit of value offered in order to put money to work. If you are patient enough, then you can find nice entries occasionally.</p>
      <p>As far as selling is concerned, it doesn’t look like you can do so anytime soon, and therefore I think you get a situation where it’s very unlikely that the trend changes unless of course the Bank of Japan changes its overall tone, something that I don’t see happening easily.</p>
      <p>With this, I think the market eventually continues to go higher, but keep in mind that Tuesday is July 4, meaning that it is Independence Day in the United States. This means that there will be a serious lack of liquidity during the day in North America, so I’m not expecting a big move in the short term.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound initially pulled back during the trading session on Monday, but then turned around to show signs of life again. By doing so, it looks as if the market is doing everything it can to continue going higher, which would be a simple continuation of everything that we had seen up to this point.</p>
    	<p>After initially pulling back, the market then broke above the top of an inverted hammer late last week, which is one of my favorite long signals.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA sits just below, and it should offer a certain amount of support for this market. Given enough time, I fully believe that this is a market that will do everything it can to continue going higher, as the US dollar is taking it on the chin in various pairs during the day.</p>	
    	<p>That being said, keep in mind that the Tuesday session is Independence Day in the United States, so there will be a certain lack of liquidity that you have to deal with. Nonetheless, this is a market that I think you will eventually continue to see upward pressure, and therefore by the end of the week I anticipate that the market will be higher than it is right now.</p>
      <p>Underneath, we have the 50-Day EMA coming into the picture also, and therefore I think we’ve got a situation where that could offer a bit of dynamic support. After all, it is a widely followed technical analysis indicator, and I think a lot of people will be looking to find “cheap British pounds” if they get the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Whether or not they get that opportunity remains to be seen, but I certainly think that given enough time they will. With this, I’m looking at more of a “buy on the dips” strategy, as we move forward.</p>
      <p>The market is one that I have no interest in shorting, because it has been one of the better performers even in times when the US dollar picks up a bit of strength. With that, I’m waiting for an opportunity and will be pulling the trigger on each dip to add to a bigger position.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has shown itself to be rather bullish to kick off the trading week on Monday, as we are trying to do everything we can to break out to the upside.</p>
    	<p>Keep in mind that the Bank of Japan continues its loose monetary policy, and that will be a major driver of where this pair goes in the future. With that being the case, I like the idea of buying dips going forward, offering a bit of value that you can take advantage of.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, I think this market breaks toward the ¥185 level given enough time by the interest rate differential between the United Kingdom and Japan, which is extraordinarily wide. Underneath, I think there is a significant amount of support near the ¥180 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area where we’ve previously seen a little bit of support.</p>	
    	<p>If we were to break down below there, then the market could go down to the ¥175 level, which is where the 50-Day EMA currently resides. All things being equal, the market will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, and we are a little bit stretched at this point, so I think a little pullback does make sense. On the other hand, if we were to simply shoot through the ¥185 level, then the market could go much higher. Kicking off the next “leg higher.”</p>
      <p>That being said, I think the market is stretched and sets up a bit of a pullback that we can take advantage of “cheap British pounds.” The 200-Day EMA is all the way down at the ¥168 level, so the fact that we are this far ahead of the 200-Day EMA does suggest that we are overdone.</p>
      <p>Regardless, it also tells me that it’s not a market that you need to be shorting under any circumstances. Be patient, and wait for some type of opportunity to get long again. Chasing this trade is not going to be the way forward, and therefore I think you need to understand just how to wait for an optimal entry.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The euro has initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Monday, testing the 50-Day EMA again. The 50-Day EMA is an area that I think you see a lot of noise at, and therefore I think we will continue to see buyers jump into the market in this general vicinity, as it offers a little bit of value.</p>
    	<p>With that being the case, it’s probably only a matter of time before we continue to try to reach toward the 1.11 level, which is a psychologically important figure, and an area that recently had been a bit of trouble. With that, given enough time I think you probably continue to have plenty of interest in this market, but I don’t like the idea of chasing it every time it drops.</p>	
    	<p>In general, we could find ourselves very choppy, and confused. That’s been the overall attitude of markets for a while, and I just don’t see how that changes with the ECB and the Federal Reserve essentially being on the same path.</p>	
	    <p>The 1.10 level has a certain amount of psychology attached to it, so I think that there might be a big fight just waiting to happen in the general vicinity, but we will have to wait and see. I have no interest in selling this pair until we break down below the 200-Day EMA, although I do think that the US dollar will probably start to strengthen again, it just might not be against the euro itself.</p>
      <p>With that being the case, I like the idea of buying dips, but on short-term charts only. Whether or not we can truly break out remains to be seen, but I certainly think that in the short term we have the high probability of the market going nowhere and essentially treading water.</p>
      <p>This will be especially true on Tuesday, as it is Independence Day in the United States, and we don’t have a lot going on. With the lack of liquidity and lack of economic news, I anticipate that we continue to see this market stay in this overall range for the time being. If you are short-term trader with a range bound system, this might be the market for you.</p>

    	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar has been very quiet on Monday, as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior. The 50-Day EMA sits just above, showing signs of resistance. Ultimately, this is a market that I think given enough time will probably have to squeeze out of this little range we are in, but currently it looks as if the 0.66 level underneath could be a major support level.</p>
	    <p>If we were to break down below the 0.66 level, then it opens up the possibility of a move down to the 0.64 level. That would be the so-called “measured move” from the previous consolidation range.</p>	
	    <p>If we were to turn around and break above the 50-Day EMA, then we could go look into the 200-Day EMA after that. Above there, then we have the 0.68 level, which was the top of the previous consolidation area before. That being said, this is a market that is going to continue to be very noisy, especially as we have a lot of questions as to what the global economy is going to be doing in the future.</p>	
	    <p>All things being equal, this is a market that continues to be very noisy, and therefore I think you have to assume that the Australian dollar will continue to be noisy as well. I need to see some type of impulsive candlestick in order to put money to work, so it can give us an idea as to where we are going to go for a bigger move. In the meantime, I think you need to be very cautious with your position sizing and recognize that we probably get a lot of back and forth more than anything else.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that Tuesday is Independence Day in the United States, so that will also keep the market somewhat choppy and noisy as well, so with that being the case, I think you have to look at this through the prism of a lot of hesitation and uncertainty, but given enough time, I do think that we will have to make that bigger decision. A little bit of patience probably goes a long way, to keep that in mind.</p>

    	<p>By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss</p>
	    <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's share of currency reserves reported to the International Monetary Fund rose in the first quarter of the year, in the midst of a still aggressive rate-hike cycle from the Federal Reserve aimed at curbing uncomfortably high inflation.</p>	
    	<p>The greenback's share of reserves rose to 59% in the first quarter of the year, from 58.6% in the last three months of 2022.</p>	
	    <p>The euro's share, however slipped to 19.8% in the first quarter, down from 20.4% in the previous three months.</p>
      <p>Global reserves, which are reported in U.S. dollars, are central bank assets held in different currencies used in part to support their liabilities. Central banks sometimes use reserves to help support their respective currencies.</p>
      <p>"The dollar remains an attractive destination for those seeking yield or a safe place to hide given the wobbly outlook for global growth," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Convera in Washington.</p>
      <p>The dollar index was down about 0.9% in the first quarter after falling as much as 7.7% in the last three months of last year. In the second quarter though, the dollar index recovered a bit, rising 0.4%.</p>
      <p>The euro, on the other hand, rose about 1.2% in the first quarter, after surging 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
      <p>The Fed, which has raised U.S. borrowing costs last year and in 2023 than at any time since the 1980s, has raised interest rates to a range of 5.0%-5.25%, from 0% in March of 2022. U.S. rate futures have priced in on Friday an 84% chance of a 25 basis-point rate increase in the July meeting.</p>
      <p>The U.S. central bank though is near the end of its tightening cycle.</p>
      <p>That said, market participants believe that while the dollar will remain the dominant currency, its influence will eventually wane.</p>
      <p>A survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), a think tank, showed that 75 central bank reserve managers surveyed only anticipate a slight decrease in the dollar's share of total reserves to 53% in the next decade, from just under 60% now.</p>
      <p>This shift, OMFIF, said, will be in line with the slow, decades-long trend of de-dollarization.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session but then started to grind higher again. Ultimately, we are in a massive uptrend, and therefore I think we got a situation where we eventually make the target of the ¥148 level, an area that is the “measured move” of the bullish flag underneath, and then of course, the ascending triangle underneath there that suggest somewhere around the same area as well. In other words, this remains a “buy on the dip” type of market, as we have such a huge interest rate differential between the United States and Japan.</p>
    	<p>As long as the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, which it looks like it may even raise interest rates 2 more times this summer, and the Japanese continue to keep a loose monetary policy, there’s no real reason why this pair won’t go higher over the longer term. With that being the case, I think we continue to see more of the same, and I look at any pullback as an opportunity to pick up a little bit of value. The ¥142.50 level underneath is the short-term “floor in the market”, with the 50-Day EMA digging into the bullish flag that I mentioned previously.</p>	
    	<p>Until the central banks change their monetary policies, it’s almost impossible for this market to drop from here, as you get paid to hold onto the US dollar, while you have to pay to hold onto the Japanese yen. Whether or not we get there quickly or not remains to be seen, but it certainly looks as if the market is going to continue to have plenty of upward pressure over the longer term, so there is no scenario in which I’m willing to start selling this market. Granted, it will change eventually, but we are probably several months away from that actually being the case. We are a little stretched, so any dip at this point in time will almost certainly be thought of as a buying opportunity by many traders around the world, which is something that I do not expect to change anytime soon.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has initially tried to rally during the trading session on Thursday, but then gave back gains rather quickly as it looks like we continue to see a lot of volatility. With that being the case, the market is likely to continue to see a drop toward the 50-Day EMA, which is closer to the 1.25 level. In general, I think we’ve got a situation where the market will be very noisy, but I also recognize that we are very much in an uptrend.</p>
    	<p>Because of this, and the fact that the Bank of England is so tight, I think it’s likely that we see a scenario that traders will still be attracted to the British pound in general. However, with the unemployment claims number being lower than anticipated, it has thrown a little bit of money back toward the US dollar as the Federal Reserve will have to remain tight for quite some time.</p>	
	    <p>If we were to turn around and break above the top of the candlestick for the Thursday session, then it would open up the possibility of a move to the 1.2750 level, which was the top of the Wednesday candlestick. Above there, then we test the highs again, as we have seen quite a bit of upward pressure over the longer term.</p>	
    	<p>Whether or not that continues remains to be seen, but I do think that we have a situation where you still have to look at this through the prism of an uptrend. In fact, it’s not until we break down below the 200-Day EMA, closer to the 1.2350 level that I would consider this as a potential trend change.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I suspect a lot of people will simply be stepping to the side and waiting to find some type of value that they can take advantage of. With that in mind, a supportive daily candlestick will attract quite a bit of attention from me, and I would probably be a buyer. However, if we break down below the 200-Day EMA, it’s very possible that we could plunge toward the 1.1850 level next.</p>

    	<p>The British pound has stabilized a bit during the trading session on Thursday, as it looks like we are going to continue the overall uptrend. That being said, we probably have a bit of choppy trading ahead of us, due to the fact that we are so overextended. Markets have a couple of choices when they get a bit parabolic like this, they can either spend time grinding sideways, or pull back. It looks at this point that the British pound may spend more time going sideways than anything else, despite the fact that Wednesday was a very negative session.</p>
    	<p>Underneath, the ¥180 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where a lot of people will be paying attention to. Any pullback to that area probably attracts a certain amount of support that people will be willing to take a look at, but even if we were to break down below there is very likely that the 50-Day EMA, near the ¥175 level, should continue to be a major influence as well. With that being said, I think that is the “floor of the market” at the moment, and therefore I would be surprised to see the market breakdown below there. If it did, then we can start to rethink the entire situation.</p>	
    	<p>That being said, just above we have the ¥185 level offering resistance, from a psychological standpoint. As far as longer-term trading is concerned, I assume that this pair will eventually try to get to the ¥200 level, over the longer-term. I don’t necessarily think that happens easily or right away, but in the meantime, I look at pullbacks as a potential buying opportunity, as the market has proven itself to be so resilient, and of course, the Bank of England has to worry about quite a bit of inflation, while the Bank of Japan is seemingly worried about trying to create more inflation, keeping its monetary policy very loose while its counterpart in London is very tight.</p>	
    	<p>Because of this, the swap in this pair continues to be a major driver of this pair going higher. With this, the market continues to see upward pressure in the longer-term, with perhaps the occasional value offering on the dips.</p>

    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Thursday but has since seen quite a bit of negative pressure. The unemployment claims number in the United States was better than anticipated, so people are worried about whether the Federal Reserve will have to continue tightening, which of course, they do.</p>
	    <p>Some people will not listen to Jerome Powell, even though he has already said there are 2 more interest rate hikes coming. With that, there is a certain amount of disbelief in the markets when it comes to the Federal Reserve, so when you see moves like this, it’s normally those people being slightly convinced a bit further.</p>	
	    <p>In general, this is a market that is facing the 50-Day EMA just below, and I think it probably could offer a little bit of support, just as it did last week. If we slice through that 50-Day EMA, then it’s possible that we could go down to the 200-Day EMA underneath. All things being equal, the market breaking through all of that opens up the possibility of a much deeper correction, perhaps even a trend change.</p>	
	    <p>It certainly looks as if the market is going to continue to be very noisy, and of course, the US dollar has the very tight Federal Reserve behind it. However, the European Central Bank has already stated that they are more likely than not going to raise interest rates next month as well.</p>
      <p>In other words, I think you continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, and therefore we have to be very cautious about position sizing. I would not go “all in” into this market, and quite frankly I expect to see further choppiness going forward. With this, the market is likely to be more noisy than anything else, so with that in mind, I think we have to look at this more or less as a consolidation area. Expect a lot of choppiness, and therefore you will probably have to trade this market from a very short-term perspective.</p>

    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Euro pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, as we continue to hang around the 1.09 level the market recently has fallen down to the 50-Day EMA, only to turn around and show signs of strength.</p>
    	<p>All things being equal, this is a market that continues to look at the 1.09 level as a bit of a fulcrum for price. Ultimately, this is a market that has been very noisy for quite some time, mainly due to the fact that both central banks are essentially in the same boat.</p>	
	    <p>All things being equal, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, but ultimately, I think we have to figure out whether or not the ECB or the Federal Reserve is going to be more aggressive.</p>	
	    <p>I think at this point, the market is likely to be very noisy and choppy in this area, and I believe that this is more or less going to remain a situation where short-term traders will continue to push things back and forth and therefore, I think we’ve got a situation where you will have to look at this through the prism of neutrality. If you are a short-term trader, then a range-bound system probably continues to work out quite well for you.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA underneath could offer a bit of support near the 1.0850 level, and then of course the 200-Day EMA underneath there would as well. That being said, I think the 1.10 level above is going to continue to be a bit of a short-term ceiling in the market, as traders try to determine whether or not they have the momentum to continue breaking above all of these levels.</p>
      <p>If we do, then the 1.11 level will offer the next ceiling. If we were to get above there, then the market could very well go much higher, as it frees the market from all of the short-term overhead resistance. I don’t see that happening easily though, so more likely than not you will have to focus on small movements, perhaps on the 15 minute chart.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Tuesday as we are trying to work off some of the excess profit from the last couple of weeks.</p>
    	<p>Ultimately, this is a market that I think is just simply starting to kill time to build up enough momentum to go higher finally. The ¥145 level is likely the next target, while the ¥142.50 region should be the short-term support.</p>	
    	<p>Looking at the chart, you can also see that there is a bullish flag that we broke out of, and this bullish flag measures for a move to the ¥148 level. Underneath there, we had previously been in an ascending triangle, which measured a move closer to the ¥149 level.</p>	
    	<p>In other words, this market eventually gets to go much higher, but in the short term, we must work off some of that momentum. This is typical because, in an uptrend, you get sideways action or some pullback after a burst higher like we had just seen.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, even if we do pull back rather significantly, the 50-Day EMA is sitting right in the middle of the bullish flag, and I think it shows that the market is probably going to continue to respect that previous area as a bit of a floor in the market, assuming that we even pull back that far. I recognize that the interest rate differential between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan continues to be very wide.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we should continue to see the US dollar gain at the expense of the Japanese yen. For that matter, the Bank of Japan is still very much in its quantitative easing program, so one of the best trades this year has been to go short of the Japanese yen, not only with the US dollar but multiple other currencies such as the British pound, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, etc. I think that continues to be the case as we advance, so the US dollar will continue to be the winner in this market by default, as the Japanese continue to keep their rates so low.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has pulled back during the course of the week, after initially touching the 200-Week EMA. This is interesting, considering that the Bank of England raised interest rates by 50 basis points this past week, instead of the expected 25.</p>
	    <p>In other words, you would have thought that the market was going to take off to the upside, but clearly had not. With this, we now start to focus on the 1.2650 level, which was an area of significant resistance previously, and now is significant support. With this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before you get some type of reaction.</p>	
	    <p>Even if we don’t, there is another support level near the 1.2350 level, which is also where the 50-Week EMA hangs about. That obviously would be an area of support as well, and therefore I think you would have to think that the market would eventually find buyers in that region. However, if we were to break down below that level, then there’s a real chance that the market breaks down for a longer-term move.</p>	
	    <p>That being said, if we turn around and take out the highs of the last couple of days, then it’s likely that we go looking to the 1.30 level, which is my target longer-term, unless things change.</p>
      <p>That being said, the fact that we broke down after the surprise interest rate does perhaps give me a lot of concerns, due to the fact that the market did the exact opposite of what you would expect. In general, this is a situation where we have to be very cautious, but we do have these levels of pay close attention to.</p>

	    <p>The euro has been noisy as of late, and it does make a certain amount of sense that we continue to see a lot of volatility as we are between the crucial 200-Week EMA above and the 50-Week EMA below.</p>
    	<p>The candlestick itself shows quite a bit hesitation, as the previous week was so bullish, we are now trying to figure out what to do going forward. After all, the European Union seems to be entering some type of recession, while at the same time we have the inflationary concerns worldwide.</p>	
    	<p>When you look at this chart, you can see just how noisy things have been as of late, and it does look like we are trying to form some type of “rising wedge.” Because of this, we could get a correction, but the 200-Week EMA above is a major resistance barrier.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, I think we are trying to figure out whether or not the Federal Reserve will continue to tighten, and the fact that Jerome Powell continues to reiterate that argument is something that traders should be paying attention to.</p>
      <p>With this, I do think that there is some downside risk, but whether or not we can truly break down remains to be seen. I think there are so many different people out there pushing so many different narratives that the market is going to continue to struggle.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, position sizing will be crucial, but I think this is more or less going to be a scenario where you’re probably better off trading more of a range bound short-term chart than anything else.</p>

    	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The Australian dollar has plunged during the course of the week as we continue to worry about the overall growth of the global economy. All things being equal, this is a market that I think will continue to move back and forth with the idea of whether or not we can strengthen economically. The 0.66 level being broken to the downside opens up the possibility of a move down to the 0.65 level, and then eventually the 0.64 level.</p>
    	<p>Looking at the weekly chart and most certainly the daily chart, you can see just how crazy the volatility has become, therefore I don’t have any interest in trying to get too cute with this market.</p>	
    	<p>We are still very much in a downtrend, but it’s also worth noting the recent reversal due to the Reserve Bank of Australia doing a surprise interest rate hike, shocking the market to say the least.</p>	
    	<p>With this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before the market turns things back around, and if Jerome Powell continues to be very hawkish, that obviously could be a major influence.</p>
      <p>However, I think the only thing you can count on at this point in time is going to be a lot of noisy behavior, so be aware of that and understand the fact that we have a lot of confusion out there and it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where longer-term traders are going to have an easy go at this. It is because of this that I look at this more or less from a consolidation range on the daily chart.</p>

    	<p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee declined on Friday, but performed better than the other Asian currencies, thanks to persistent foreign inflows into domestic equities, traders said.</p>	
    	<p>The rupee was at 82.0250 to the U.S. dollar by 11:28 a.m. IST, down from 81.95 in the previous session. The losses in the domestic unit paled in comparison to its Asian peers.</p>	
    	<p>The Korean won was down 0.7%, the offshore Chinese declined to a new year-to-date low and the Indonesian rupiah and the Malaysian ringgit were both down 0.4%.</p>
      <p>"Similar to how it has played out most of this week, rupee is an outperformer in the Asia space," a forex sales person at a private bank said.</p>
      <p>"Equity flows and lack of speculative interest in the face of low volatility, I assume, are the main reasons for this."</p>
      <p>Foreign investors have poured $2.5 billion into Indian equities in the last seven sessions, according to data from NSDL. Due to this, the BSE Sensex reached a record high this week.</p>
      <p>Worries over China's faltering post-pandemic recovery and hawkish central banks weighed on Asia equities and currencies.</p>
      <p>The Bank of England on Thursday raised rates by a bigger-than-expected half a percentage point to rein in inflation that is the highest among major economies.</p>
      <p>Norway's central bank, too, raised its key policy rate by 50 basis points, a larger-than-expected increase. Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that more rate hikes were needed to tame sticky inflation.</p>
      <p>The dollar index climbed to 102.66, helped by the weak risk appetite.</p>
      <p>Bigger-than-expected tightening across European central banks is affecting global growth outlook and this could trigger a safe-haven move back into the dollar, Ed Moya, senior market analyst at broker OANDA said.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The pound suffered trading volatility on Thursday as investors weighed up news that the Bank of England (BoE) had hiked interest rates by 0.5%, and what this could mean for the British economy.</p>
    	<p>After the noon announcement it made a knee-jerk spike of 0.4% against the dollar (GBPUSD=X), to more than $1.28, as higher interest rates mean the pound is worth more abroad. However, the currency pared back its gains amid recession fears.</p>	
    	<p>“Rather than sending sterling soaring, today’s bigger than expected jump in interest rates has left the pound like a rabbit in the headlights,” Simon Phillips, managing director at travel money firm No1 Currency, said.</p>	
    	<p>“Sterling has been fluctuating wildly as global investors decide whether buying pounds is still a good bet with so much uncertainty surrounding the UK’s economic prospects.</p>
      <p>“Nevertheless the pound is still hovering close to a 14-month high against the US dollar, and this week it hit its highest level against the euro since last August.”</p>
      <p>He added: “But exchange rates can fluctuate a lot at times like these. So if you are planning a trip abroad in the coming weeks or months, it could make sense to pick up some foreign currency now rather than leave it all to the last minute.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, warned that looking ahead to the end of the year the pound would be weaker</p>
      <p>“The outlook for sterling is weaker across the year. As the likelihood of a recession rises, the pound is likely to come under pressure,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sterling was also flat against the euro (GBPEUR=X), which is worth 86p.</p>
      <p>The volatility came as members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to increase the bank rate to 5%, its highest level in 15 years, in a bid to combat rising inflation and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.</p>
      <p>Financial markets are now betting on at least another four 25bps hikes still to come, making for a terminal rate of 6% by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>"We’ve raised rates to 5% following recent data which showed that further action was needed to get inflation back down," Andrew Bailey said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"The economy is doing better than expected, but inflation is still too high and we’ve got to deal with it.</p>
      <p>"We know this is hard – many people with mortgages or loans will be understandably worried about what this means for them. But if we don’t raise rates now, it could be worse later.”</p>
      <p>Shorter-maturity UK gilt yields also rose on the back of the news, while rates on longer bonds such as 10-year gilts fell due to bets that the tightening cycle would slow the economy.</p>
      <p>The yield on two-year UK bonds, which is the rate the government promises to pay holders of its debt, increased two basis points to 5.05%, while the coupon on 10-year gilts dipped almost five basis points to 4.35%.</p>
      <p>“Although the Bank warned of further tightening ahead, it shied away from using language that would signal a repeat of today’s bold move and confirmed data dependency,” Andy Burgess, fixed income investment specialist at Insight Investment, said.</p>
      <p>“The markets’ initial reaction was that more now means less later, with UK gilt yields rallying on the announcement.”</p>
      <p>Muhammed Demir, head of capital markets at Swiss Finance Corporation, added: “The Bank of England needs to face up to the fact that the UK is drifting aimlessly into emerging market territory.</p>
      <p>“If there are no structural improvements to the UK economy, we will continue to see rates rising, inflation sticky and anaemic economic growth. This will inevitably lead to a weaker pound in the long run.”</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday as we continue to see upward pressure. All things being equal, the market is trying to get to the ¥142.50 level, an area that was a previous swing high.</p>
	    <p>Because of this, the market looks as if it is trying to build up enough momentum to make a bigger move, perhaps finally breaking through a lot of resistance and going much higher. When you look at the overall market picture, the bullish flag that was recently broken measures for a potential move to the ¥148 level, perhaps even higher than that.</p>	
	    <p>Furthermore, we also had an ascending triangle previously that measured for something similar.</p>	
	    <p>Looking at this chart, we also had that ascending triangle shows a lot of resistance at the ¥138 level, which due to “market memory,” could offer a lot of support as it was so resistive previously.</p>
      <p>With that being the case, I think it also is interesting that it lines up as the bottom of the bullish flag, so it does suggest that we have a lot of support in that area just waiting to come into the market if necessary.</p>
      <p>Because of this, if we were to break down below that level, then I think it opens up a massive amount of selling. This would also make sense because the 50-Day EMA is hanging around as well.</p>
      <p>In general, this is a market that I think still looks higher, and therefore I am a buyer of dips. I do believe that longer term you will be rewarded with a bigger move, and of course you get paid a positive swap, depending on your broker, for holding onto it.</p>
      <p>The Bank of Japan has recently reiterated its desire to stay loose for longer, therefore I think this all lines up in a one way trade. After all, even at the Federal Reserve doesn’t raise interest rates next meeting, the interest rate differential is still wide enough to drive a truck through, and I think that is going to be the biggest driver of this market going forward.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday but then gave back gain rather significantly. At this point, the British pound may try to reach down toward the 1.2650 level, an area that has been important previously. This is previous resistance, and the fact that we have broken above there suggests that we should see a certain amount of support if we pull back to that level.</p>
    	<p>It’s also worth noting that the 50-Day EMA is racing toward the same area, so it does make a certain sense that we would see that perhaps offer a bit of support also. All things being equal, I think we are looking for support underneath, and the fact that the Bank of England has an interest rate decision on Thursday also has a lot to do with what we are seeing. If they sound very hawkish, that could be the catalyst to send this market higher. While the Federal Reserve remains tight, the Bank of England seems to be believed to be even more hawkish.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, this is a market that is going to be difficult to start shorting anytime soon, so I think you have to look at this pullback as either buying opportunity or just something you get away from.</p>	
    	<p>The British pound has been one of the better performers against the greenback all year, and I don’t necessarily think that’s going to change anytime soon, but if we get a huge run toward the US dollar, then we might see quite a bit of damage to this pair.</p>
      <p>That being said, you are probably better off shorting other currencies against the greenback, just due to the fact that the British pound has been so strong for so long. All things being equal, this is a pair that I think is simply looking for support at a lower level, and that might happen once we get through the Bank of England announcement and statement. Expect volatility, but don’t get too aggressive until we get through that issue.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Weakness in the yen is broadening with a trade-weighted gauge of the currency falling to the lowest in more than two decades as officials in Tokyo issue more warnings about sharp moves.</p>
    	<p>Deutsche Bank AG’s measure of the yen’s strength versus its global trading peers closed at a record low Monday, according to data going back to 2000. The currency has found itself caught once more in the widening gap between the Bank of Japan’s super-easy monetary policy and the hawkish shift seen in counterparts in Europe and the US.</p>	
    	<p>The move will add to expectations of at least more verbal intervention to help stabilize the currency, which has fallen by more than 7% this year against the dollar and 9% against the euro.</p>	
    	<p>Japan’s finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said Tuesday he continues to closely watch moves and will take appropriate action on foreign-exchange policy as necessary. Later, economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that officials were watching out for any excessive or speculative moves in the market.</p>
      <p>The yen pared a modest decline to edge higher to around the 141.70 per dollar level in Tokyo trading, just off a seven-month low against the greenback.</p>
      <p>“Actual intervention is unlikely now but risks may become more real when it drops beyond 145 and 150 at a fast pace,” said Tsutomu Soma, a bond and currency trader at Monex Inc. in Tokyo. “The European currency crosses look most bullish versus the yen.”</p>
      <p>The yen is down against every G-10 peer so far in June, thanks to the stark contrast between the BOJ and peers. Last week, the Federal Reserve signaled it may resume tightening after a June pause, the European Central Bank hiked and suggested more is likely in July, while traders expect the Bank of England to lift rates on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the BOJ kept a dovish tone, a move strategists said opened up the door for a further slide in the currency.</p>
      <p>Last year, the yen weakening toward 146 per dollar triggered Japan’s first intervention to prop up the currency since 1998, though in the build up to that there were repeated official warnings about direct action.</p>

    	<p>European Union legislation needed to underpin a digital euro, originally due to be published June 28, has been put on hold, CoinDesk has been told.</p>
    	<p>The move follows the leaking of the draft bill, which covers privacy and technical issues for the central bank digital currency (CBDC), and a statement by finance ministers that appeared to question the motivation for the plan last week.</p>	
    	<p>The timeline for the draft bill, intended to be published ahead of a firm European Central Bank decision on whether to issue the currency in a digital form, has shifted several times. It was at one stage planned for May.</p>	
    	<p>The bill was most recently been scheduled for discussion and publication at a June 28 meeting of the European Commission’s decision-making body, according to a tentative forward agenda published last week. The commission did not provide a reason for the delay, nor did it give a new date for publication.</p>
      <p>The plans were also discussed by finance ministers from the euro area at a regular Thursday meeting.</p>
      <p>Ministers stressed the “importance of developing a compelling and clear narrative regarding what would be the added value of this development” in terms of a difference to the economy and citizens’ lives, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe in a statement after he chaired the talks, adding that “within our institutions ministers want to support this work but also look at how we can further develop that narrative.”</p>
      <p>The legislative text seen by CoinDesk last week sought to bar banks paying interest on digital euros and merchants charging for using it.</p>
      <p>CoinDesk has reached out to the European Commission for comment.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The US dollar has tried to rally a bit during the trading session on Monday, but it’s worth noting that it was Juneteenth in the United States, so a certain amount of liquidity would be missing.</p>
    	<p>Furthermore, the market looks as if it is facing resistance near the ¥142.50 level. If we can break above there, then the market is likely to continue going much higher. On the other hand, if we pull back from here, I think that the ¥140 level is an area of significant support.</p>	
    	<p>We have recently broken out of a bullish flag, which of course makes a lot of technical traders interested in this pair. I think you have to be a buyer of dips in this market, and I do think that eventually we break above the ¥142.50 level.</p>	
    	<p>After all, the market has a massive interest rate differential between the 2 central banks, and it’s obvious that the Federal Reserve is still relatively tight. Despite the fact that they chose to skip the latest meeting for an interest rate hike, the Bank of Japan has made it clear that they are going to keep that loose monetary policy.</p>
      <p>Measuring the potential move based on the bullish flag, it looks like this pair will eventually go looking to the ¥148 level above. That being said, the ascending triangle that the market broke out of previously before breaking out of the bullish flag measures for a move closer to the ¥150 level.</p>
      <p>Pullbacks will more likely than not see the ¥138 level offer a significant amount of support as it was the top of the ascending triangle. Furthermore, the 50-Day EMA sits right around that level as well, so it all comes together for a nice potential floor in the market.</p>
      <p>At this point, I have no interest whatsoever in trying to buy the Japanese yen, so this is a one-way trade as far as I can see, which is the same thing I can say about multiple Japanese yen related pairs, not just this one. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see plenty of interest to the upside.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has shown itself to be a little bit hesitant during the trading session on Monday, as we have been overdone for the last few days.</p>
    	<p>Ultimately, the market has broken out and now it’s going to more likely than not try to pull back and find support. If the market can pull back toward the 1.2650 level, that’s an area where the market could find support based upon previously resistive action.</p>	
    	<p>Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility and upward momentum, but given enough time I do think that we will have to have a bit of a pullback in order to bring in more buyers. It’s worth noting that the United States is closed for the Juneteenth holiday, so this is not a normal trading session. The 1.2650 level should offer support, but even if we were to break down below there, then the 50-Day EMA comes into the picture as well.</p>
      <p>If we turn around and break above the candlestick from Friday, then it’s possible that we could go looking to the 1.30 level. The 1.30 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that I think is the target recently.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, this is a market that I think sees a lot of upward pressure given enough time, but I do recognize that there will be a significant amount of volatility on short-term charts. I have no interest in shorting this market, at least not unless something fundamentally changes with the overall economic situation. Yes, I do recognize that the global economy is going to be sluggish, and therefore the US dollar will probably attract a certain amount of attention when economic issues appear.</p>
      <p>As things stand right now though, there’s no point in shorting this market, and I do think that it’s only a matter of time before value hunters come back into the market based on some type of supportive action. Ultimately, it’s not until we break down below the 200-Day EMA that I would be interested in shorting, which is closer to the 1.2350 region.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound rallied rather significantly during the course of the week, using the ¥175 level as a launching pad. Looking at the size of the candlestick, it’s obviously a very bullish move, and we have broken through a ton of massive resistance. At this point, we’re even above the ¥180 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. That being said, we need some type of pullback in order to get involved. Chasing the trade all the way up at this level is very dangerous.</p>
    	<p>Markets can’t go straight up in the air forever, and you need to be very cautious with that type of attitude. I think at this point you need to find value, and that value may look kind of scary at one point. We might see some type of massive move lower in the short term, that is what gets people bailing.</p>	
    	<p>You need lower prices, even if I do think that given enough time, we will reach the ¥200 level. Obviously, that is a longer-term target, and even though we got to the ¥180 level much quicker than anticipated, I don’t envision a market where we take off straight up in the air to the ¥200 level.</p>	
    	<p>If we were to turn out and break down below the ¥165 level, then it’s possible that we could go down to the ¥172.50 level, an area that had been supported during the previous week. Below there, then we have the ¥170 level. All things being equal, this is a market that I think eventually find buyers on dips, and you need to be one of them if you plan on getting involved. If you are already long of this market, then it’s about trade management.</p>

    	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The Australian dollar has broken above the 0.68 level, showing a massive amount of bullish pressure. The market continues to look very bullish, despite the fact that there are a lot of concerns about the overall global economy.</p>
	    <p>This is mainly due to the fact that the Reserve Bank of Australia has recently had a surprise interest rate hike, while the Federal Reserve has stood still. While the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates later, it seems like the markets are not worried about it at the moment.</p>	
	    <p>That being said, the market is also above the 50-Week EMA, so that does suggest a certain amount of bullish pressure as well. The market will continue to see buyers on dips, but if we were to turn around and take out the bottom of the weekly candlestick, that could send this market back down to the 0.66 level.</p>	
	    <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is considered to be a major risk appetite based currency, and therefore we need to see more animal spirits in the markets overall. That being said, it looks like we are trying to get to the 0.70 level, although it may not necessarily be in a straight line like we seen over the last 3 weeks.</p>
      <p>If the Aussie is going to continue to go higher, that will not only be a sign of Australian dollar strength, but more likely than not be more indicative of US dollar weakness. While I do believe that the markets continue to look higher, keep in mind that if there are signs of trouble, this market will turn around and break down.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has rallied rather significantly during the course of the Friday trading session as we continue to see a parabolic move. The Bank of Japan continues to see the desire to keep monetary policy loose, and therefore it does make a certain amount of sense that the Japanese yen continues to get pummeled.</p>
    	<p>On the other side of the equation, the Bank of England has to deal with hot inflation, and therefore it does make quite a bit of sense that we would continue to see a lot of upward pressure on the British pound. Keep in mind that the market saw several massive candlesticks in a row, so we are without a doubt very impulsive at this point.</p>	
    	<p>But that type of impulsivity, it’s almost impossible to start shorting this market, due to the fact that the Bank of Japan is not changing its attitude anytime soon. This is a market that is overstretched, but I think at this point in time it’s only a matter of time before buyers stepped back into this market and take advantage of “cheap British pounds.” The ¥175 level underneath will be a major support level, but that’s also a drop of over 600 pips as I record this.</p>	
    	<p>On the upside, I think the market eventually goes looking to the ¥185 level, and longer-term it’s possible that we even go as high as ¥200. However, I don’t think you can chase the market as things stand right now, due to the fact that we have ripped 600 pips this week alone. With this, I think you’ve got to be very patient and wait for an opportunity to get long of the market again at a lower level.</p>
      <p>Selling is all but impossible at this point, due to the fact that it is such a bullish market. With this being the case, the market is likely to continue seeing plenty of people try to chase this market, but the smarter trader will simply wait for some type of value to get involved. Chasing all the way up at this level is a great way to lose money.</p>

	    <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar initially tried to rally during the trading session on Friday, as we threatened to the crucial 0.69 level. By doing so, it looks like we are finally going to see a little bit of gravity in this pair, but I don’t necessarily think it is going to turn the market around completely.</p>
	    <p>The market has gotten a bit parabolic, in several different markets, not just this one, and I do think that a correction needs to happen. After all, markets do not go in the same direction forever.</p>	
	    <p>The currency market looks at the Australian dollar as a “risk on currency”, and therefore I think you need to look at it through the prism of whether or not everybody is buying risk at this point. It’s probably worth noting that we have only had one negative date leading to this one over the last couple of weeks, so I think a pullback toward the 0.68 level makes quite a bit of sense, especially as it was the previous resistant barrier, and therefore a certain amount of “market memory” could come into play here.</p>	
	    <p>It was the top of a major consolidation area, but we have now ripped right back through it and shown quite a bit of volatility. Underneath there, we have the 200-Day EMA that offers support near the 0.6754 level, and therefore if we break down below that, I think it would really start to have this market selling off.</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia had a surprise interest rate hike recently, while the Federal Reserve chose to pause its interest rate hiking cycle, so therefore it does make sense that the Aussie has been bullish recently. However, the Federal Reserve swears up and down that they will be raising rates later in the year, so it’s possible that not only did we rally quite drastically, but we may be trying to carve out an even bigger range.</p>
      <p>A short-term pullback is the most likely outcome at the moment, and therefore I think we need to pay close attention to how the market behaves near the 0.68 level. The buyers will be trying to get to the 0.70 level.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- The yen weakened to its lowest since November as traders shifted their focus from a hawkish Federal Reserve to Friday’s Bank of Japan policy decision.</p>
    	<p>The Japanese currency fell as much as 0.7% to 141.08 per dollar, triggering comments from Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno that excessive movements weren’t desirable. Last month when the yen weakened to similar levels, top currency official Masato Kanda said that the government would take action if needed, after an unscheduled meeting between the BOJ, Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Agency.</p>	
    	<p>A hawkish stance from Fed officials on Wednesday stands in sharp contrast to BOJ policymakers who have stuck with monetary easing, a disparity that favors the dollar over the yen. The Fed projected borrowing costs will go higher than previously seen, while almost all of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg see the BOJ leaving its ultra loose policy unchanged Friday.</p>	
    	<p>“Given the market movements and the Fed’s policy outlook, there is growing possibility that the three-way meeting will be held and such concern will probably grow in the market,” said Takeshi Ishida, currency strategist at Resona Bank Ltd. “However, the upside of the dollar-yen may be limited as the US Treasury yields haven’t risen that much.”</p>
      <p>Demand for the dollar was also likely influenced Thursday by Japanese importers, who typically buy the greenback on trading days that are a multiple of five such as the 10th, 15th and 20th of any month.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to Friday, BOJ officials likely see little need to adjust their yield curve control program given some improvement in the functioning of the bond market, according to people familiar with the matter. Governor Kazuo Ueda said earlier this month that the BOJ has consistently stated it will maintain easing until its price goal is achieved in a stable manner, feeding further into speculation the central bank will stay pat in coming months.</p>
      <p>BOJ’s Ueda Likely to Hold With Bond Market on His Side for Now</p>
      <p>Last year, the yen weakening toward 146 per dollar triggered Japan’s first intervention to prop up the currency since 1998, though in the build up to that there were repeated official warnings about direct action. The Japanese currency has fallen about 7% this year.</p>
      <p>“A sustained break above 141 opens the door for levels above 142 to be tested and potentially quite quickly,” said Rodrigo Catril, strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “Intervention is unlikely to do much to arrest yen weakness, it merely offers an opportunity to reset shorts.”</p>
      <p>(Updates with additional context. A previous version corrected the date of Fed comments.)</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as we wait for the Federal Reserve announcement. That being said, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, and therefore I think we will have to wait to see what the Federal Reserve does, and then of course what happens in England, although it’s probably worth noting that the British are dealing with very hot wage gains, which will continue to fuel inflation. In other words, it’s very likely that the Bank of England will have to remain tight for quite some time, and I think a lot of people are looking at it through the prism of this fact.</p>
    	<p>Currently, it looks as if we are trying to form a little bit of a double top, or breakout. I suspect that within the next day or 2, we should have a resolution to this question. With that being the case, I think a little bit of patience probably goes a long way. If we were to turn around and break down below the 1.2550 level, then it’s possible that we could go down to the 1.2350 level underneath, to continue the overall consolidation area.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA underneath offers plenty of support, and therefore it’s likely that a lot of people will pay close attention to that level. Underneath there, then we have the 200-Day EMA near the 1.2250 level, where the overall trend will be dictated. Ultimately, this is a situation where the market will have to make a lot of decisions if we get anywhere near that indicator.</p>	
    	<p>As things stand right now, I think there will be plenty of buyers willing to take advantage of dips in this market, but whether or not we break out right away remains to be seen. There is the possibility of a “double top” foreman, but I think it’s probably a little early to try to start shorting this market anytime soon. Ultimately, I think the only thing you can count on is a lot of volatility over the next couple of days as we have the Federal Reserve and of course the European Central Bank influencing the dollar with their rate decisions.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the early hours on Monday, to continue the move above the ¥175 level. That being said, the market does look like it’s running into a lot of resistance, and perhaps the British pound is a little bit tired against the Japanese yen. Nonetheless, there is a lot of support underneath, so I do think that this will only open up the likelihood of buyers jumping into this market based on value.</p>
    	<p>The ¥175 level of course is a significant round figure that a lot of people will pay attention to, and an area where we had seen a lot of resistance previously. If we were to break above the top of the candlestick for the Monday session, that would obviously be a very bullish sign.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, I see the ¥172.50 level as potential support, so if we were to break down significantly, then that will be our first major buying area. Underneath there, then you have the ¥170 level, where the 50-Day EMA has just crossed. It is probably worth mentioning that there is a minor support level near the ¥171.50 level, so that could also come into the picture as well.</p>	
    	<p>At this point, the pair does continue to be very noisy, but overall it does end up being a lot of upward momentum over the longer term. Quite frankly, this is just simply a matter of trying to find “cheap pounds” and take advantage of the overall structural weakness of the Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Bank of Japan does have a meeting on Friday, and therefore that could come into the picture as well, although they have already somewhat signaled that that it is very unlikely that they are going to be doing anything to change monetary policy.</p>
      <p>In other words, you continue to get paid to hang on to this currency pair via swap, so I just don’t see why traders would suddenly run away from that interest-rate differential situation. Ultimately, I do think that we will try to get to the ¥177.50 level, but you don’t want to be overly exposed to any particular one currency pair at the moment right now, due to the fact that we have so many central banks meeting this week.</p>

    	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar has rallied significantly during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to reach toward the 0.68 level. That being said, we are getting overstretched, and one would have to assume that sooner or later, we get some type of pullback.</p>
    	<p>This is especially true due to the fact that the market has been straight up in the air for the last couple of weeks, and of course we have the Federal Reserve meeting coming up on Wednesday, which will obviously have a major influence on the US dollar.</p>	
    	<p>Pay special attention to risk appetite in general, as that’s a major driver on the Australian dollar, and therefore I think at this point in time it’s likely that the overdone attitude in this market could cause a lot of headaches. After all, the 0.68 level above has been a major barrier that has been difficult to take out previously, and therefore I think the fact that we’ve shot straight up in the air to get here makes it even less likely to be taken out.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, we have the 50-Day EMA near the 0.6675 level, and that should offer a certain amount of support. If we were to break down below there, then it’s likely that we could go to the 0.66 level underneath, which was the previous support level for the overall consolidation range.</p>
      <p>The question now isn’t so much as to whether or not the Australian dollar is bullish, but whether or not we have just simply entered that previous consolidation area that we spent so much time in previously.</p>
      <p>That being said, if we were to take out the 0.68 level, then it does open up the possibility of a move to the 0.70 level. The one wildcard that could make that happen easily is the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, if for some reason they sound extraordinarily dovish.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the RBA recently did a surprise interest rate hike, but at this point almost all central banks are tight, perhaps with the exception of the Bank of Japan, so I don’t know how drastically the market would change unless they did something truly shocking.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar continues to see a lot of noisy sideways action against the Japanese yen, as we are in the midst of forming something along the lines of a bullish flag. Furthermore, we just broke out of a major ascending triangle a couple of weeks ago, and therefore it looks like the market is trying to find its footing.</p>
    	<p>Now that we have the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, there’s a lot that could come out of that as well, not to mention the fact that the Bank of Japan has a meeting on Friday, although they have already stepped in front of that and suggested that not much was going to change.</p>	
    	<p>If the Federal Reserve were to raise rates yet again, that might shock the market a bit, sending the pair higher. Ultimately, I do think that’s what happens anyway, due to the fact that the Bank of Japan is showing absolutely no proclivity to change its monetary policy anytime soon. With that being the case, the interest rate differential alone will be interesting for people out there to take advantage of.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, the ¥138 level seems to be a major support level, with the 50-Day EMA racing toward it to offer a bit of support. It’s not until we break through all of that that I would be somewhat concerned with the uptrend. This does not mean that it will be easy to go higher right away, but what it does suggest is that there are plenty of buyers willing to take advantage of “cheap US dollars” along the way.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the ¥141 level is a barrier that a lot of people will be paying attention to, as it is previous resistance and it does make quite a bit of sense that we would see the market trying to break it. If we do break above there, then you kick off the next leg higher which could be a measured move all the way up to the ¥148 level, based upon not only the potential bullish flag, but also the ascending triangle that was such a huge part of this market previously.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Monday but gave back gains to show hesitation yet again. Quite frankly, the British pound has been a little overly noisy, as the area above the 1.2550 level seems to be very noisy.</p>
    	<p>Anything above there does attract a lot of pressure, but quite frankly, the market is likely to see a lot of noisy behavior above that level. If we do break down below there, the market then opens up the possibility of a move back down to the 50-Day EMA underneath.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA of course is an area that people will be paying close attention to from a technical standpoint, and it could be a short-term target, possibly short-term support. On the other hand, if we turn around and take off to the upside, we could see an attempt to break above the 1.2680 level, an area that has been massive resistance.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, this week will be very noisy for this pair and many others as the Federal Reserve has an interest rate meeting on Wednesday that comes into the picture. This of course could cause a lot of volatility for the US dollar, and therefore you could see a lot of noise right around Wednesday.</p>
      <p>That being said, the Thursday session also features the ECB meeting, and while it won’t directly affect the British pound itself, it will have a knock on effect on the US dollar also. In other words, there will be more volatility that day if we see a sudden move in the greenback.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, this looks like a buy on the dip type of situation, but a certain amount of caution will be needed to keep this market easily traded, as the volatility is going to be very extreme in the middle of the week, thereby keeping your position size reasonable allows you to move through the volatility that we are certainly going to see, and therefore gives your trade a bit of room to breathe going forward.</p>

      <p>In this article:</p>
    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The euro rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to test a short-term range. The 1.08 level above seems to be offering resistance, while the 1,07 level underneath offers a little bit of support due to the 200-Day EMA coming into the picture.</p>
    	<p>There’s also an uptrend line underneath, and therefore I think there is plenty of support to keep this market afloat. However, this week is going to be extraordinarily dangerous in this pair once we get going, as the Federal Reserve has an interest rate meeting on Tuesday, and the European Central Bank has its meeting the very next day. In other words, we are about to get a resolution to all of this choppiness.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA is sitting just above as well, so that’s also worth something as far as resistance is concerned. Ultimately, this is a market that I think over the next 2 days might be somewhat quiet, but once we get to that Federal Reserve meeting and statement, things are about to get really wild. Another thing you need to keep in mind is that the reaction on Wednesday could very well be counteracted by the one on Thursday, meaning that the initial reaction might be the wrong one.</p>	
    	<p>All things being equal, this is a market that is in an uptrend, and you would have to assume that we will eventually see that takeover, but things could change rapidly due to the events over the next couple of days, so caution is the better part of valor, and quite frankly you might even be better off staying away from this pair until we get some type of resolution.</p>
      <p>That being said, if the market makes a move ahead of the announcements, it’s possible that we could see the market trying to “front run the central banks”, but again, that would be extraordinarily difficult, and therefore you need to be cautious, as this will be the epicenter of most of the volatility for the next week or so, and therefore a situation that needs to be taken using caution and experience.</p>

    	<h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The US dollar initially tried to fall against the Japanese yen during the trading session on Tuesday, but then turned around to show signs of life again. By doing so, the market ended up showing more of a “buy on the dip” mentality, therefore allowing the market to go looking to the ¥141 level above, which was where we pulled back from a couple of weeks ago. Breaking above that level then opens up the possibility of a move to go much higher.</p>
	    <p>Ultimately, I do think that happens and therefore this recent pullback to test the top of the ascending triangle that had been so important in this market for so long. I do think that we do see plenty of upward momentum over the longer term, so I remain very bullish of this pair.</p>	
	    <p>This will be especially true if next week the Federal Reserve decides to raise rates again or sounds hawkish in general. If they do, then we could see this market go much higher. Ultimately, if we do break above the ¥141 level, I think it becomes more or less a “buy-and-hold” market. Ultimately, at that juncture it’s likely that we could go looking to the ¥148 level. The ¥148 level is the “measured move” of the ascending triangle so that then becomes my target.</p>	
    	<p>On the other hand, if we were to break down below the ¥130 level, then we could test the 50-Day EMA. The 50-Day EMA of course is a technical indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to, so therefore it does make a lot of sense that it could offer a little bit of a moving floor. Breaking down below that would of course be very negative, but I just don’t see that happening unless of course the Federal Reserve surprises with its interest-rate statement or perhaps its future outlook. If that’s the case, then just about anything can happen obviously, but right now it seems as if we are more likely than not going to see a lot of choppy behavior more than anything else.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gain rather quickly. At this point, the market is likely to see the 50-Day EMA is an area of interest, as we are testing it yet again. Underneath, we have the 1.2350 level, an area that had previously been supported. Breaking down below that then opens up the possibility of a move to the 200-Day EMA, and therefore dropping down toward the 1.2250 level.</p>
    	<p>Ultimately, the market turning back around and showing signs of life could open up the possibility of a move toward the 1.2550 level above, which is an area that has been significant resistance previously. Because of this, I think we’ve got a situation where the market is more likely than not going to continue being noisy, and therefore will be worth paying close attention to when we approach some of these levels mentioned. I think we continue to see a lot of back and forth more than anything else, so keep your position size reasonable and recognize that the market has a lot to chew through in order to get moving for any significant move.</p>	
    	<p>Ultimately, this is a market that I think will be paying close attention to the idea of whether or not the Federal Reserve is going to continue hiking, of course what the deal is going to be when it comes to economic growth or perhaps even the lack of it around the world. If there are a lot of economic concerns, this does drive money into the US dollar historically.</p>	
    	<p>That being said, this is a market that I think eventually will have to figure out which direction to focus on, and I think the next couple of weeks could be important to determining the overall directionality of this market given enough time. With that in mind, I suspect we will see a lot of sideways action in the short term, but eventually should give it a bigger break that we can follow. With this, be cautious with your position sizing but once we do break out of this overall range, it’s time to get much bigger.</p>

    	<p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session early on Monday, as the Japanese yen continues to lose value. That being said, there is a little bit of pushback, so it is worth paying close attention to the fact that the ¥140 level has caused a little bit of a headache for the bulls.</p>
	    <p>However, we have sliced through here previously, so now it’s just a matter of time before we have to determine whether or not we can breakout above the recent high. If we can, then the market is more likely than not going to continue to go much higher, with a potential move all the way to the ¥148 level based on the previous ascending triangle that I have marked on the chart.</p>	
	    <p>That does not mean that we get there overnight, nor should you jump in with both feet. However, I still believe in the bullish narrative here, and I think that it is probably only a matter of time before the rest of the market moves right along with it. That being said, the choppiness that comes along with this pair is something that you need to keep in mind when you put on a position. Position sizing will be crucial, but eventually you should get some type of clarity. Once we get a breakout above the recent high, then I think the next target will probably be ¥142.50.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, the top of that previous consolidation triangle sits right out the ¥138 level, so it is with paying close attention to that area as a potential value buy. I don’t even think we get there, but if we do I’d be very interested in anything that looks a lot like a supportive candlestick or a possible bounce. The 50-Day EMA is starting to race toward that area as well, so it all ties together quite nicely and I think it is probably only a matter of time before the 2 meet, but the question at this point is whether or not they be closer to the ¥138 level, or if it is later down the road.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, as we may have gotten a little too close to the ¥175 level in short order for people to feel comfortable. That being said, the market will more likely than not offer a bit of a pullback that we can take advantage of, in order to pick up a bit of value. </p>
    	<p>The ¥170 level underneath would obviously be a great candidate for value, but there are support levels between here and there. The main reason for the ¥170 level being mentioned of course is the large, round, psychological importance of the number, and the 50-Day EMA racing toward that level.</p>	
    	<p>Between here and there, the ¥171.50 level has been supportive multiple times a little over a week ago, and I think that could be where you start to see buyers jump into the mix. It’ll be interesting to see if that plays out, but right now I think you got a situation where it would be an area to start “scaling into a position.” Keep in mind that the interest rate differential between the British pound and the Japanese yen will continue to make this market bullish given enough time, but ultimately, I do think this is a situation where we will have to see some type of resolution to the overall attitude.</p>	
    	<p>When you look at the chart, if we were to break above the ¥175 level, it would obviously be a major breakout, and it’s likely that we could go all the way to the ¥177.50 level, and then eventually the ¥180 level. Until we get some type of change from the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England, there’s no real interest in shorting this pair, but it’s probably worth noting that again, we are a bit overstretched. There are plenty of people willing to go long in this market, and I do think that will continue to be the case given enough time. In general, I think this market continues to be noisy, but I do look at it as a positive one.</p>

    	<p>Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noise in this general vicinity, as we have seen the 1.2350 level offer support, while the 1.2550 level has been resistance. Ultimately, this is an area where we have seen a lot of noisy behavior and therefore, I think it’s likely that we will continue to see choppiness.</p>	
	    <p>If we do break down below the 200-Day EMA, then it’s possible that the market could drop down to the 1.1850 level, an area that we have seen a lot of support at previously, and of course it’s very likely that we continue to see a lot of interest in that area. If we were to break down below there, obviously would open up the trapdoors and we could go much lower.</p>	
	    <p>In general, this is a market that I think probably finds a little bit of support underneath, and therefore it could be very noisy, and therefore you need to be very cautious with getting too aggressive at this point. Ultimately, this is a market that I think will probably move back and forth along with risk appetite, which of course is going to be all over the place. With this, I would be very cautious but I also recognize that it looks like the US dollar is starting to pick up a little bit of steam.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if the market were to turn around and break above the recent high near the 1.2680 level, then we could go to the 1.30 level above, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where a lot of people will be paying close attention to, and therefore I think it could cause a lot of noise.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar has gone back and forth during the course of the trading session on Thursday, as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior. With this being the case, the market is likely to looking toward the ¥140 level above, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area where we’ve seen a little bit of selling pressure.</p>
    	<p>That being said, I do think it is probably only a matter of time before we see this market breakout above there, especially as the interest rate differential between the United States and Japan is so wide.</p>	
    	<p>The ¥138 level underneath is the top of an ascending triangle, which of course is a pattern that almost everybody is paying close attention to. With this being the case, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we find plenty of buyers, due to the market memory, and of course the fact that most people will understand that technical traders will be chasing this move. Because of this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we get a bit of a move. If we do break above the ¥140 level, that opens up the possibility of fulfilling the entire measured move, which is all the way to the ¥148 level.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA sits right around the ¥136 level and is rising quite drastically, and therefore I think it’s probably only a matter of time before that would come into the picture to show signs of support as well, assuming that we even drop down that level. In general, I think this is a scenario where we continue to see a lot of noisy volatility, but clearly we have a lot of questions to ask, and clearly have a lot of upward pressure on the US dollar. Furthermore, the market also has to keep in mind that the Federal Reserve is likely to remain tight for the foreseeable future, while the Bank of Japan continues to insist on a very loose monetary policy, making the Japanese yen much less appealing.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has pulled back initially during the trading session on Thursday, to test the 50-Day EMA. However, we have turned around to show signs of life again, and it now looks as if we are going to go looking toward the 1.2550 level.</p>
    	<p>If we get there, it does have a significant amount of resistance built into it, despite the fact that we have broken above there previously. Short-term pullbacks should continue to offer buying opportunities, but I don’t necessarily think that we are breaking out anytime soon.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, the 1.2350 level should offer a significant amount of support, especially as there is an uptrend line right around the same area, and of course it is the area between the 200-Day EMA underneath, and the 50-Day EMA above. In this area, we will see a lot of noisy behavior, and I do think that eventually buyers would come back into that area. However, if we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, the market is likely to drop down to the 1.1850 level underneath, which is a significant support level.</p>	
    	<p>In general, this is a market that I think will continue to be very noisy, but you can probably say the same about most currency pairs right now, and with that being the case I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we would see both buyers and sellers get aggressive. At the end of the day, I do think that we have more buying pressure than selling pressure at the moment, as the Bank of England continues to be fighting major inflation. With this, it’s unlikely that we will continue to see the British pound fall significantly, unless of course we see a huge run into the US dollar overall. That being said, the British pound has been one of the better performers against the greenback this last year, so I think it’s probably only a matter of time before the buyers will come back on short-term debts. Whether or not we break out is a completely different question.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Thursday but has turned around to show signs of life again. Ultimately, it looks as if the market is trying to do everything he can to break out to the upside, and if we can break out above the ¥174 level, then it’s possible that the market could go much higher, perhaps reaching toward the ¥175 level. Ultimately, I think this is a market that will eventually break out to the upside, and it’s more of a “buy on the dips” type of situation.</p>
    	<p>When you look at the chart, the ¥170 level is a major support level that we will have to pay close attention to as support, especially with the 50-Day EMA running toward it. Because of this, it’s probably only a matter of time before we see buyers coming back into the market and start picking up value along the way. I don’t necessarily think that it’s going to be a straight shot higher, but I certainly believe that the buyers have most of the control at the moment.</p>	
    	<p>Furthermore, keep in mind that the interest-rate differential between Great Britain and Japan continues to be huge, therefore it does make quite a bit of sense that we continue to see the pair go higher based on the interest-rate differential, and of course the so-called “carry trade.” Ultimately, I do think that we go much higher, but we may get the occasional short-term pullback which you should look at as a potential value play, that traders will take advantage of going forward.</p>	
    	<p>I have no interest in shorting this market, as I believe the Japanese yen has quite a bit of pain ahead just waiting to happen. Because of this, I do think that it’s impossible to short this market anytime soon, at least until the Bank of Japan changes its overall attitude and monetary policy, something that I just don’t see happening very easily anytime soon.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the trading session on Thursday as we continue to dance around the 1.2350 level. The 1.2350 level has been supported a couple of times in the past, and therefore the market reacting to this level is not a huge surprise. The market is trading between the 50-Day EMA above and the 200-Day EMA underneath. This typically is an area that will be very choppy on a chart, because the market is trying to determine whether or not it is going to stick with what has been an uptrend, or if we are going to turn around.</p>
	    <p>There are certainly enough reasons out there to be concerned about the uptrend, not the least of which would be the fact that there are a lot of economic concerns around the world. While it is not necessarily the United Kingdom that traders are concerned about, the reality is that a lot of traders will run toward the US dollar in times of economic uncertainty, and therefore it has a bit of a “knock on effect” in this currency pair. If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, then we could make a move down to the 1.1850 level. The 1.1850 level has been a major swing low, so breaking that could open up the floodgates to the downside.</p>	
	    <p>On the other hand, if we turn around and break above the highs from the Wednesday session, we could make a move toward the 1.2750 level, which is an area that has been resistance in the past.</p>	
	    <p>The market should continue to be noisy to say the least, but if we were to reach toward that area you would have to start to question whether or not the British pound could finally make it to the 1.30 level. Looking at this chart, it’s easy to see that we are at an area of potential inflection point, and that typically means that you are going to see some type of volatility, right along with the possibility of some type of impulsive candlestick that could get the market moving rather quickly.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has fallen initially against the Japanese yen during the trading session on Thursday, and it looks as if we are going to continue to see pressure to the upside and it looks like if we can break above the area here at the ¥172.50 level, it’s likely that we go looking for the ¥175 level after that. The ¥175 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and therefore one would assume that there is going to be a certain amount of reaction to that region.</p>
	    <p>On the downside, I believe that the ¥170 level offers a lot of support, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area that we see some action at in the past. For the short term trading situation, I believe that the ¥170 level underneath is a significant short-term “floor in the market.” The market will continue to see more of this “buy on the dip” mentality, therefore I think we’ve got a situation where you can only be long of this market, and shorting it is all but impossible.</p>	
	    <p>Keep in mind that the interest rate differential between the 2 currencies is rather drastic, and that of course will drive a lot of money toward the British pound for the “carry trade” that is now back in vogue. It’s worth noting that we broke through the top of the most recent significant pullback, so now we are just simply building up the pressure to go to the outside.</p>	
	    <p>Expect a lot of volatility, but that’s nothing new for this pair. The pair does tend to be very noisy and therefore you have to be cautious with your position sizing and recognize that you may have to ride out a significant amount of volatility. Nonetheless, I do think that we get to the ¥175 level sooner rather than later, therefore I look at this market as a lot like a beach ball being held under water, in the sense that once it breaks above the resistance, it will pop straight up in the air.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The euro has fallen again during the trading session on Thursday, as it looks like we’re going to head down to the 200-Day EMA. The 200-Day EMA of course is a longer-term indicator that a lot of people use to determine the overall trend. Ultimately, the market will probably find a little bit of support in that area, but if we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, then it opens up the possibility of a move down to the 1.05 level.</p>
	    <p>One thing is for sure, this correction in the euro has been a bit deeper than I think a lot of the bulls are comfortable with. Now we ask ourselves whether or not this is going to be a bigger turnaround, or if the market is going to bounce from here and try to go toward the 50-Day EMA above. The 1.09 level of course would be an area that could be resistance, especially as the 50-Day EMA is right around the same area. Breaking that opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.11 level, which is where the market had pulled back from.</p>	
	    <p>All things being equal, this is a pretty deep correction and we have not necessarily broken down to a bearish trend yet, but we certainly are getting relatively close to doing so. I suspect that the next few days will probably be crucial in determining whether or not the euro can continue to go higher over the longer term. If we were to somehow break down below the 1.05 level, that would be lights out for the euro, meaning that it would almost certainly fall apart at that point.</p>	
	    <p>There are a lot of concerns out there about the global economy, and that money flowing toward the US dollar for safety. While the euro is not necessarily a “risky currency”, it is not as much of a safety currency as the greenback is. With that being said, I think the next couple of days will be crucial and we should see some type of bigger move start to formulate.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>During the week, the US dollar rallied again, breaking out from a major resistance level at the ¥138 level. With that being the case, the market will continue to see plenty of noise above, but it certainly looks as if the interest rate differential between the 2 currencies will continue to play the main part of what happens in this market right now. It’s worth noting that the major breakdown that we saw late last year was a pullback to the 50% Fibonacci level, and therefore it’s likely that the market could go looking to the ¥140 level.</p>
	    <p>The size of the candlestick certainly suggests that there is a lot of noise out there, and with that being the case, it looks as if you will probably have to ride out through a lot of volatility, and therefore it does make a certain amount of sense that the trading community will continue to be somewhat schizophrenic.</p>	
	    <p>All things being equal, I am a buyer of dips, and it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see a lot of back-and-forth trading. If you are a longer-term trader, you are going to have to deal with that, perhaps with a reasonable position size.</p>	
	    <p>On the downside, the ¥134 level should be massive support, right along with the 50-Week EMA which sits just underneath it. All things being equal, the ascending triangle has been broken to the upside, so that obviously is very bullish as well. All things being equal, this is a market that I am looking for value on, and I do like the occasional short-term pullback to offer that opportunity.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The euro has gone back and forth during the trading week as we are trying to figure out what’s going on with markets in general. We are between the 50-Week EMA underneath, and the 200-Week EMA above. This typically means that you’ll see some choppy volatility, which in this environment makes quite a bit of sense as we have so many questions to be asked.</p>
	    <p>With this, the market has a lot of questions to ask of itself, and of course, the risk appetite of the market will continue to have a major influence attached to it. The risk appetite is all over the place, but quite frankly I think this is a situation where you need to be very cautious of putting on too big of a position in one direction or the other. That being said, Friday did show some signs of life for the euro again, suggesting that perhaps we are not ready to fall apart quite yet.</p>	
	    <p>I would anticipate a lot of back and forth in what could end up being a summer range, and therefore a range bound market trading strategy might come into the picture, but as things stand right now it’s obvious that there is quite a bit of buying pressure over the longer term. That being said, it’s probably worth noting that we are near the 50% Fibonacci or to level, and that of course has its own ramifications.</p>	
	    <p>The markets still have to deal with the volatility and noise going forward and therefore you will have to exercise caution more than anything else at this point.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Thursday but then turned around to show signs of life again. At this point, the ¥138 level is being threatened, and a breakout above that level could open up the possibility of a much bigger move, something that, more likely than not, will be a lot like a “beach ball being held under water,” only to be released and shoot straight up.</p>
    	<p>This is a lot of selling pressure in this area that the market will have taken out. In that scenario, you would anticipate that there should be a certain amount of “FOMO” trading coming into the market.</p>	
    	<p>On the downside, the ¥135 level should be pretty significant support, especially considering that the 50-Day EMA is starting to race toward it, and thereby offers a bit of support. The market more likely than not will continue to be noisy, as interest rates have a major influence on where we go next. Ultimately, this is a situation where a lot of people will be looking to buy the dip, as it offers value.</p>	
    	<p>The interest-rate differential will continue to favor the US dollar, so at this point in time I just don’t see how this changes. This will be especially true if there are a lot of traders jumping into the market to buy dollars in order to look for safety. Ultimately, this certainly looks as if the market is doing everything it can to break out, and once it does it should be a pretty significant one.</p>
      <p>I have no interest in selling this market anytime soon, and I believe that most participants feel the same way. The Bank of Japan remained steadfast in its need to do quantitative easing, and as long as that’s going to be the case and of course the Federal Reserve remains tight, it does make a lot of sense that this market continues to grind to the upside. Once the resistance gets broken though, the floodgates could open and the Japanese yen could be sold off across the board.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar has pulled back just a bit against the Japanese yen during the session Tuesday, as we continue to see the uptrend play out, and traders come in to try to stabilize the move higher. Ultimately, this comes down to interest-rate differential between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, which of course is currently working with each yield curve control policy. In this environment, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where the pair changes its overall attitude, which has been building and ascending triangle, showing signs of building even further upward pressure. If we could break above the ¥138 level, it will kick off a much bigger move.</p>
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA sits underneath, with the 200-Day EMA just underneath there. This all revolves around the ¥134 level, so at this point as long as we can stay above there, we should see plenty of bullish behavior. If we were to break down below this moving averages, then we would test the bottom of the ascending triangle, which of course should have plenty of support. Anything breaking that triangle would completely change the picture in this pair.</p>	
    	<p>If the market were to break above the ¥138 level on a daily close, I believe that the market could go much higher, perhaps to the ¥148 level before it is all said and done. As the Bank of Japan looks like it is going to stay ultra-loose with its monetary policy and has to flood the market with Japanese yen occasionally to buy bonds, it’s likely that we will continue to see more upward pressure than anything else.</p>	
    	<p>However, a lot of noisy behavior would be expected along the way, as is pair is very sensitive to interest-rate differential and all economic announcements that give us a bit of a heads-up as to where interest rates may go. It’s also worth noting that the market is doing everything it can to convince himself that the Federal Reserve is going to have to loosen monetary policy sooner rather than later. Although this is probably not true, it certainly has a major influence on this pair.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the trading session on Tuesday, as the 50-Day EMA underneath continues to offer a little bit of support, but at the end of the day, there’s probably even more support at the 1.2350 level. The 1.2550 level above offers a little bit of resistance, and the market seems as if it is happy to chop back and forth in this area. With that being the case, the market is likely to continue seeing a lot of volatility and uncertainty, and that does make a certain amount of sense considering everything that’s going on with the debt ceiling situation in the United States and of course, the overall economic uncertainty around the world.</p>
	    <p>Looking at this chart, it’s obvious that we have been very noisy for a while, and I don’t think that changes anytime soon. Ultimately, this is a situation where remains “buy on the dips”, but if we were to break down below the 1.2350 level, it could change quite a few things. In that scenario, the 200-Day EMA would almost certainly be tested, sitting near the 1.2250 level, and then after that we could drop as far as the 1.1850 level.</p>	
	    <p>Either way, this is going to be an interesting market to follow, because there is a huge inflation battle in the United Kingdom, while at the same time there are questions out there about whether or not the Federal Reserve can stay tight forever. I doubt they can, but at this point in time it’s very likely that they will stay tight for much longer than the market give them credit for.</p>	
	    <p>Ultimately, if we do eventually break out to the upside, clearing the 1.27 level would be the first major hurdle to get beyond. If we do, then it opens up the possibility of the British pound trading at 1.30 eventually, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant number that would attract a lot of headlines. If that happens, it’s probably going to be in an environment where the US dollar sells off in general.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The euro initially tried to rally during the session on Tuesday but gave back gains as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior around the 50-Day EMA. The 1.09 level has been important previously, so it should not be a huge surprise to see it act as a bit of a barrier, especially considering that the 50-Day EMA sits right there as well.</p>
	    <p>Ultimately, this is a market that I think given enough time will have to make a bigger decision, but it’s obvious that we are in an area that is going to be hotly contested. This makes sense, considering that there is so much in the way of confusion economically, and of course traders around the world continue to build their own narrative as to what the central banks are going to do.</p>	
    	<p>Underneath, the 1.08 level does offer a certain amount of support, and if we were to break down below there it’s likely that the market could drop down to the 200-Day EMA, which sits near the 1.07 level. The 200-Day EMA attracts a lot of attention as a trend defining indicator, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would expect to see volatility if we do drop to that area. We have seen a lot of negativity in the euro recently, but at the end of the day, the US dollar has been oversold for a while so this should not be a huge surprise.</p>	
	    <p>Ultimately, choppy volatility will probably continue to be the way forward, especially as we head into the summer time, and volumes may drop a bit. Either way, it does look like we probably have more downward pressure than up in the short time, so therefore I lean toward fading rallies, but I would not get too heavy in a position, regardless of the direction you choose. With this, short-term charges will probably be favored, with a shorter-term bias of “fade the rally” as the markets continue to see a lot of uncertainty, perhaps driving more money back into the US dollar. Keep in mind, you cannot get married to anyone position in this environment.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar initially fell against the Japanese yen during the week but has turned right back around, showing signs of life again. This makes perfect sense, considering that the Federal Reserve continues to be very tight, while the Bank of Japan continues to do everything it can to keep interest rates low. By doing so, they have to print Japanese yen in order to buy those bonds, keeping the JGB down to 50 basis points or less. With this, I think the situation continues to see a lot of Japanese yen being printed, and that of course works against the value of the Japanese yen. Because of this, there is a bit of upward pressure in this market.</p>
    	<p>If the market was to break above the top of the weekly hammer, then it’s likely that we go looking toward the ¥138 level above, which has been like a brick wall. If we were to break above that, then we would clear the top of the triangle, and open up a bigger move to the upside. In that environment, we could be looking at the ¥147 level before it’s all said and done, which is my target eventually. I don’t expect to get there anytime soon, but I think a retest of the high that we made last year is probably on tap unless of course the Japanese change their monetary policy quickly, or if the Federal Reserve steps away from its tight policy, something that I don’t expect to see from either one.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Week EMA is sitting right around the 133.50 again level and is rising, and of course we have the trend line just below there. In other words, this is more likely than not going to end up being a “buy on the dips” type of market, just as it has been for some time. Expect choppiness, but eventually I would anticipate that the buyers will overwhelm the sellers, offering a bit of momentum above that ¥138 level. As far as selling is concerned, I don’t have any interest in doing so at the moment, but would reevaluate things if we were to break down below the ¥132 level.</p>

	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
	<p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading week but gave back quite a bit of the gain to show signs of negativity. The market has been in a strong uptrend for several weeks in a row, and therefore printing a negative candlestick is a reasonable thing to do. After all, markets cannot go in one direction forever. That being said, a lot of traders will look at this as an opportunity to find a bit of value. A lot of traders will be out there looking for a “buy on the dips” situation, and they may get one if they are willing to wait for a candlestick or 2 to form.</p>
	<p>The 1.2350 level is an area where I would expect to see support based upon the fact that it was previous resistance, so with that in mind I’m looking for supportive candlesticks underneath to take advantage of. Even if we were to break down below there, the 50-Week EMA will certainly offer a bit of support as well. Alternatively, I think it’s only a matter of time before the buyers return, and I don’t necessarily think this is the end of the overall uptrend, at least for now.</p>	
	<p>That being said, the market will continue to be very noisy, and therefore I think you need to pay close attention to monetary policy because both of these banks are going to be very tight. The British pound has been one of the better performers over the last year or 2, so, therefore, it’s difficult to fight this trend, but if we do see some type of change in tone from the Bank of England, that might be a reason to send this market lower, or perhaps if we get some type of negative economic news that sends people running toward safety in the form of the US dollar. However, this one negative candlestick is not enough to change the overall attitude at this point.</p>

    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The euro initially tried to rally during the trading week but then fell apart. At this point, the euro has turned around quite drastically, breaking down below the 1.09 level. The 1.09 level is an area that had been supported previously, and the fact that we are plunging so quickly, it’s likely that we could go down to the 1.07 level, maybe even a little bit lower, to reach the 50-Week EMA. The 200-Week EMA has offered significant resistance, so it’ll be interesting to see whether or not the market will look at that as a ceiling.</p>
	    <p>In general, this is a market that is squeezing between the 2 major moving averages, and that typically causes a lot of volatility. Furthermore, you need to keep in mind that the European Union is probably going to be facing some major issues, and with concerns about the global economy and banking sector, it does make a certain amount of sense that the US dollar could attract inflows. Furthermore, the tight monetary policy coming out of the Federal Reserve also makes the US dollar potentially attractive.</p>	
	    <p>It might be worth noting that on Friday, both the US dollar and gold were showing signs of strength, so it does suggest that there is a certain amount of fear in the market, and that could offer quite a bit of demand for the greenback and perhaps traders trying to run away from riskier currencies, although admittedly the euro is not necessarily like a commodity currency or an emerging market currency, it is considered 2nd to the US dollar when it comes to protecting wealth. At this point, it’s likely that we continue to see volatility and choppiness going forward.</p>

	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
	<p>The Australian dollar initially tried to rally and break above the 0.68 level. That being said, the market is likely to continue to look at this range as something that we are going to stick in, with the 0.68 level offering a significant amount of resistance, not only due to the recent price action but the fact that the 50-Week EMA sits right there as well. On the downside, we have the 0.66 level offered significant support multiple times, so we probably have a strong possibility of continuation.</p>
	<p>However, if we were to break down below the 0.66 level, then it’s likely that the market could go down to the 0.64 level, based on the “measured move” of the consolidation area. The 0.64 level is an area where we have seen buying pressure previously, and therefore it’s likely that we would see a bit of a target, and of course, buyers jumping back into the market. On the other hand, if we were to break above the 50-Week EMA, then it’s likely that the market could go all the way to the 0.70 level, based upon that same measured move as well.</p>	
	<p>Ultimately, this is a market that continues to be noisy, and I think it’s more likely than not going to continue to focus on the short term. However, if we break out of this range, you can start thinking about longer-term trades. Keep in mind that the RBA has recently had a bit of a surprise interest rate hike, but at the same time the Federal Reserve remains very tight with monetary policy. Furthermore, if there is a lot of concern out there when it comes to the global economy, that also has people running to the greenback for safety.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The US dollar bounced a bit during the trading session on Friday as we continued the recovery we had seen on Thursday. On Thursday, the market tested both the 50-Day EMA and 200-Day EMA indicators, both of which have attracted some support. Furthermore, it’s probably worth noting that the market is in an ascending triangle, which of course a lot of traders will be paying close attention to. On the top of this triangle, we see a lot of resistance near the ¥138 level. If we were to break that level, it would be a very bullish sign, and the “measured move” would suggest that the market could go as high as ¥147.</p>
    	<p>On pullbacks, plenty of buyers should be waiting to get involved because we have seen so much interest every time we have dipped. Furthermore, we have that uptrend line from the triangle that will continue to act as support, so in this environment, it’s difficult to get overly negative of this currency pair. Furthermore, the market is also cognizant that the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy, meaning they are not allowing 10-year JGB markets to offer more than 50 basis points. To do so, they need to purchase those bonds and to purchase those bonds; they have to print more currency. This lets the market with the Japanese yen, causing moves like we had seen most of last year.</p>	
    	<p>On the other side of the equation, you have the Federal Reserve. Although they may be getting close to or even be done raising interest rates, they are far from loosening them. Because of this, the interest rate differential alone will make this an attractive investment for traders in what is known as the “carry trade.” That being said, if we were to break down below the ¥132 level, it would break the pattern of the triangle, perhaps sending the market into a bit of a messier consolidation play. Either way, at this point, there seems to be no real interest in trying to sell this market off, so therefore I continue to look at dips as buying opportunities, waiting for the inevitable breakout to the upside.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has been slightly positive during the trading session on Friday, trying to stabilize after the nasty selloff on Thursday. That being said, even though the Thursday candlestick was rather negative, it did not change the trend, nor do I think that we are ready to make some attempt to do so. Rather, buyers will continue to come in and pick up dips as potential value; therefore, this remains the same as it has been.</p>
	    <p>It’s probably worth mentioning that the 50-Day EMA sits near the 1.24 level and is rising. It will eventually enter the picture and offer technical support on a pullback or when it reaches the price. However, it’s probably worth noting that the 1.27 area offered some resistance the last time we got close to it, so it will likely do it again if the price gets to that handle. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will not be able to break above there.</p>	
    	<p>Great Britain has much more inflation than a lot of other nations right now, and therefore the Bank of England will possibly remain tighter for longer than many other ones. The British pound has been one of the better-performing currencies of the year, and even though Thursday was a very nasty candlestick, one day doesn’t necessarily change the trend in a currency pair without some extraordinarily disruptive news attached to it.</p>	
    	<p>With this in mind, I believe this pair remains “buy on the dips,” at least as far as I can see. It is not until we break down below the 1.2350 level that you question whether the uptrend is running out of steam. Even then, some areas underneath it will almost certainly attract buyers. If you are looking to buy the US dollar, you probably will have better luck against other currencies as the British pound itself has been such a juggernaut for most of the last several months. If we can break above the 1.27 level, it’s possible that the British pound could go as high as 1.30 over the next several weeks. That said, it will probably be choppy behavior on the way up.</p>

    	<h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The US dollar has gone back and forth during trading this week, as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior in general. We are in a larger ascending triangle that should be paid close attention to, but I think it does make a certain amount of sense that one would have to assume there are buyers underneath willing to get involved. Having said that, we have seen a lot of erratic movement in the market as the jobs number on Friday came out much stronger than anticipated.</p>
    	<p>With that being said, there are a lot of questions as to what the Federal Reserve will have to do, and there has been a lot of panic behavior on multiple fronts. Nonetheless, we are still very much in this triangle, and I think the compression is still a very real thing. Because of this, it’s more likely than not going to be a scenario where the market will have to figure out what it’s going to do longer-term, and that might mean more volatility. The 50-Week EMA sits at roughly ¥132.50, an area that has been important multiple times on daily charts. On the upside, we have the ¥138 level offering a significant amount of resistance, so it will be interesting to see if we can get above there.</p>	
    	<p>Ultimately, this is all going to come down to the bond market, which of course is currently acting more like the equity market as far as volatility is concerned. It is because of this that you will need to be very cautious, recognizing that the currency markets are very dangerous place to be at the moment.</p>

With this being the case, I anticipate that eventually we break above the highs of the week, and continue to go higher, perhaps reaching toward the ¥175 level.</p>
	    <p>On the other hand, if we turn around and break down below the bottom of the candlestick, then it opens up the possibility of a move down to the ¥165 level, which is an area that has been an important multiple times in the past, therefore I think we have a situation where the market may have seen quite a bit of noise in that area, but I don’t necessarily think that it is reason enough to be overly concerned about reaching that area. If we do, then I would anticipate seeing a lot of value hunters coming back into the market as interest rates are obviously climbing around the world.</p>	
    	<p>Furthermore, the British economy is going to continue to see a lot of inflation, therefore it makes quite a bit of sense that we would continue to see the British pound strengthen against other currencies such as the Japanese yen. Keep in mind that the Bank of Japan continues to do everything it can to keep its interest rates down, so therefore it will have to print currency, driving down the value as they flood the market with more currency.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The Euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Friday but found enough resistance above to turn things around and started selling off. Alternatively, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, because quite frankly the markets have no idea what to do with the idea of inflation. After all, the Federal Reserve continues to reiterate its desire to stay tight for longer, and the jobs number gives it yet another reason to think so. That being said, the market seems to be arguing with the Federal Reserve and doesn’t seem to believe them.</p>
    	<p>Looking at this chart, it’s obvious that we have been consolidating for a while so it’s not a huge surprise if we get some type of buyer coming into the picture, with a 50-Day EMA reaching the 1.09 level. At this point, the euro continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, and I think a lot of questions asked about whether or not the Federal Reserve can actually stay tight for as long as they claim to. That being said, on the 1.11 level above is a significant resistance barrier, and therefore I think a break above there would really open up the floodgates. That being said, I could probably say the same thing about the 50-Day EMA underneath, as it would bring in a lot of sellers.</p>	
	    <p>All things being equal, you can only read so much into the Non-Farm Payroll number, because it does cause quite a bit of noise under the best of circumstances, and it’s not rare at all to see the market lunge in one direction, only to turn right back around later. Ultimately, the volatility is probably something that we continue to stick with, and therefore you have to be very cautious with the idea of the market suddenly changing its stripes. After all, we have seen quite a few attempts by the dollar to strengthen again, only to see it fail yet again. Ultimately, this is a market that continues to stick to the short term movement, and therefore the noisy behavior should continue.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>(Reuters) - The dollar rose on Thursday against the euro after the European Central Bank eased its pace of rate hikes, a day after the Federal Reserve hiked rates by 25 basis points and indicated that it may pause further increases.</p>
    	<p>The ECB’s 25-basis-point increase was the smallest since it started lifting them last summer, but the bank also signalled that more tightening would be needed to tame inflation.</p>	
    	<p>The Fed on Wednesday dropped from its policy statement language saying that it "anticipates" further rate increases would be needed. Market reaction was relatively subdued, however, with the euro and yen failing to break out of recent ranges against the greenback.</p>	
    	<p>The single currency has gained against the dollar in recent months as investors bet the dollar’s interest rate advantage over the single currency would continue to decline.</p>
      <p>But analysts said that much of that expected move may already be priced in, with the next focus likely to be when the U.S. central bank will start cutting rates.</p>
      <p>“The monetary policy dynamics are more or less fully priced in here at this point in terms of the tightening cycle, now it’s going to be a focus on the bets on when the Fed starts to ease, how much it eases and how that relates to what (other) central banks are doing,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.</p>
      <p>The dollar index was last up 0.15% on the day at 101.36. The index is holding just above a one-year low of 100.78 reached on April 14, and has fallen from a 20-year high of 114.78 on Sept. 28. The euro fell 0.41% to $1.1018. It reached a 13-month high of $1.1096 last week. The dollar also fell 0.34% to 134.17 Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>Fed funds futures traders are now pricing in a roughly 62% chance the Fed will begin cutting rates by July, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch.</p>
      <p>Adding to the argument that the Fed will soon begin easing monetary conditions were lingering fears of banking sector turmoil.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley said that "we think the Fed is done hiking rates. But we expect the US dollar to gain," noting that "falling Treasury yields may herald a risk-off trading environment, implying US dollar strength to come."</p>
      <p>Shorter-dated rates are likely to fall on growing concern about the U.S. banking sector, the analysts said in a report, as money market fund assets continue to grow and banks see more deposit outflows.</p>
      <p>Shares of PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp shares plunged on Thursday, dragging other regional lenders down, as reports of both banks exploring strategic options sparked investor worries of a widening financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The greenback got a brief boost on Thursday after data showed that U.S. Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - surged at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter, after increasing at a 3.3% pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>"That gave the dollar a bit of a push up because it came in quite a bit higher than expected and it’s not really commensurate with the Fed on hold story," said Osborne. This week’s main U.S. economic focus will be Friday’s jobs report for April, which is expected to show that employers added 180,000 jobs during the month, while average earnings are expected to have increased at an annual rate of 4.2%. Sterling was last up 0.10% at $1.2580 after hitting $1.2593 earlier on Thursday, the highest since June 2022.</p>
      <p>The greenback was last down 0.87% against the Norwegian crown at 10.76 after Norway's central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points as expected.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The dollar's status isn't under threat anytime soon, but the yuan and euro look most likely to cut into its lead.</li>
        <li>A "tripolar" reserve currency system is plausible, economist Stephen Jen told Insider.</li>
        <li>The greenback saw a dramatic erosion as a global reserve currency in 2022, but it's still dominant in international trade.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>The dollar has been king for decades but its slippage as a reserve currency has raised concerns as to whether a rival currency will dethrone it.</p>
    	<p>But to economist Stephen Jen, the CEO of Eurizon SLJ, a more plausible outcome would be multiple currencies cutting into the dollar's dominance.</p>	
    	<p>He recently pointed out that the greenback's nominal share in global reserves eroded at 10 times the pace seen in the last two decades.</p>	
    	<p>"Our best guess is that this trend will likely continue, but probably not to a point where a non-dollar currency commands a bigger market share than the dollar," Jen wrote in emailed comments to Insider. "More likely, we will evolve from a unipolar reserve currency world to a multi-polar world."</p>
      <p>To be sure, its role in international trade looks to remain dominant, but that won't necessarily prevent its decline as a reserve currency.</p>
      <p>When asked which currencies stand the best chance as a challenger, Jen noted that all others have flaws, especially as international currencies.</p>
      <p>"But if I have to guess," he said, "it should be the [euro] and the [yuan] having roughly equal presence. Such a 'tripolar' reserve currency configuration would also make sense and be more aligned with the economic heft of the three blocs."</p>
      <p>For China in particular, Jen said that the country's financial sector would first have to improve in quality for the yuan to make headway.</p>
      <p>Foreign investors, he explained, remain wary of buying into Chinese equities and bonds.</p>
      <p>"Without foreign demand for Chinese assets, Chinese savers and households cannot be allowed to invest overseas, and thus the capital controls would need to remain in place," the economist said. "With capital controls, it would be difficult for the [yuan] to become a viable international currency."</p>
      <p>And while there have been some announcements of bilateral trade being settled with China's currency, those volumes are small, and don't compare to volumes seen across larger financial flows, according to Eurizon.</p>
      <p>Talk of de-dollarization has surged of late amid growing signs of a tilt away from the US currency. For the first time ever, the yuan eclipsed the US dollar last month as the most used currency for Chinese cross-border transactions.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, central banks are ditching the US dollar and shifting to gold, Rockefeller International Chairman Ruchir Sharma said. Central banks account for a record 33% of monthly global demand for gold and are buying more gold than at any time since data began in 1950, he wrote in the Financial Times earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Still, the dollar's share of global currency transactions for trade finance was 83.7%, compared to 4.5% for the yuan, with analysts saying the yuan is too tightly controlled by the Chinese government.</p>

	    <p>The Euro initially rallied during the trading session on Thursday but still sees a lot of noise just above that could cause some headaches.

At that point, we would be threatening the 50-Day EMA and of course, a plethora of areas where we’ve seen some buying in the past.</p>
	    <p>All things being equal, I think this is a situation where the market certainly favors the upside, but it’s also a bit of a misunderstanding because even if the US does go into recession, it’s never happened that the US goes into a recession without the rest of the world following. In other words, sooner or later, we are going to see a flush lower, but right now it looks like we continue to see a lot of back-and-forth. In fact, I would not be surprised at all to see the market simply grind sideways for a while as we try to figure things out between now and the next Federal Reserve meeting.</p>	
	    <p>The market will continue to be noisy, as we have seen in FX markets worldwide. With this being the case, the market is likely to see a lot of choppy behavior, and therefore a lot of confusion. I think at this point in time we probably have a situation where you are more likely than not going to see a lot of short-term opportunities in a range-bound type of system going forward. Ultimately, I do favor the upside in the short-term, but longer term I do think that the Euro is going to start to have to deal with the idea of gravity. With that, it will take a lot of patience to wait and get the opportunity to short, so the market is one that you will be playing at “2 speeds.”</p>

All things being equal, this is a market that I think eventually sees sellers come back into the market to drop yet again. That being said, if the market were to take off to the upside, then clearing the 50-Day EMA could open up the possibility of a move to the 0.68 level, which is currently where the 200-Day EMA resides.</p>	
	    <p>I do believe this point in time, we will see a “fade the rally” type of market, and therefore it’s likely it’s probably a scenario where it’s difficult to get overly bullish on the Australian dollar, especially as we have a lot of economic headwinds out there. Remember, the Australian dollar is very sensitive to economic news, and of course global trade. It’s a commodity currency, and that is probably going to be one of its weaknesses going forward.</p>	
	    <p>The Federal Reserve comes into focus as well, due to the fact that the central bank will more likely than not continue to stay “tighter for longer”, despite the fact that a lot of traders out there wish differently. It’s been a bit of a standoff between the trading community and the Federal Reserve, and eventually something has to give way. I believe we are going to see that happen rather soon, so therefore I’ll be paying close attention to a potential breakdown as it certainly looks as if that’s the direction we will be heading eventually.</p>

    	<p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, as it continues its upward pressure against the Japanese yen. Ultimately, this is a pair that is trying to determine whether the longer-term trend will continue or if the recent pullback is something a bit bigger.

In other words, it does make quite a bit of sense that we would see upward pressure, but at the same time, it’s probably worth paying attention to the fact that the US dollar is struggling a bit against most currencies.</p>	
    	<p>It does not take a lot of imagination to notice that the market is forming something along the lines of a “higher level,” or you could even make an argument for someone with a longer-term double bottom. All things being equal, this is a market that I think eventually has to make a bigger decision, and it does look like the Japanese yen is going to continue to struggle. However, it is worth noting that the market may continue to show a lot of noise more than anything else, as the entire global economy is in a bit of flux at the moment.</p>	
    	<p>From a technical analysis standpoint, you can see that the 200-Day EMA sets just below, right along with the 50-Day EMA just below there. With this being the case, the market is likely to continue to see plenty of support and noisy behavior, so pullbacks will more likely than not be buying opportunities for most traders. In fact, it’s not until the market breaks down below the ¥130 level that I would be concerned about a potential bounce.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the ¥137.50 level could very well be the target, and if we break above there, then it’s likely that this market becomes more “buy-and-hold”, and therefore it could really start to take off to the upside. I’m not expecting massive moves like we saw last year, but more of a general uptrend to form makes quite a bit of sense in this situation.</p>

    	<p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
    	<p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to look at the market between the 1.24 level and the 1.25 level as trying to fight through a barrier. That being said, the market is likely to continue to break above there, then it’s likely that we could continue to go much higher. The initial target would be the 1.2750 level, an area that had been significant resistance previously.</p>	
    	<p>At the same time, we also have support underneath near the 1.2350 level and of course, the 50-Day EMA which sits just below there. The 50-Day EMA has a nice slope to it, so it does suggest that there will be buyers in this market if we pull back. In general, I think the market will continue to try to go higher, perhaps more of a grind than anything else. However, whether or not we can actually break out as a completely different story. There are a couple of candles near the 1.2350 level underneath it suggest there are buyers in that area, so if we were to break down below there then I think the British pound could start to pull back.</p>	
    	<p>For what it is worth, it is probably worth mentioning that the British pound seems to be struggling quite a bit more than the euro at the moment against the US dollar, so perhaps the real trade would be in the EUR/GBP pair. While both currencies have been bullish against the US dollar, it appears that the British pound has had a bit of a brick wall in this area, so it’s possible that it’s trying to tell us something as it slows down momentum.</p>
      <p>That being said, if you choose to short the dollar, it’s probably easier to do it against other currencies than the British pound, which has already been one of the best-performing currencies this year, but has obviously run into a significant amount of resistance, and perhaps even exhaustion after such a big move against the greenback. The volatility will probably only pick up at this point, so that’s probably something worth paying attention to as well, which can be worked against via position sizing.</p>

    	<p>The euro initially pulled back a bit during the Monday trading session, only to turn around and rally again as we continue to fight with the 1.10 level. This is obviously a psychologically important level that a lot of people will pay close attention to, as people like big figures. That being said, we have sliced through here before so it’s not exactly ironclad. If we can break above the recent high, then we could continue to grind upward and go looking toward the 1.1250 level. The 1.15 level would then be next, but all of this will take quite a bit of effort.</p>	
    	<p>If we do pull back from here, and quite frankly would not be overly surprising, I do think that there is a lot of support near the 1.09 level and of course at the 1.08 level where we have the 50-Day EMA. The 50-Day EMA is rising quite steadily, so a lot of traders will look at this as a sign that we are in an uptrend.</p>	
    	<p>In general, this is a market that I think will continue to be very noisy and choppy, especially as we are in the midst of earnings season, meaning that Wall Street will be throwing money around in various directions. Furthermore, we also have a lot of confusion as to what the Federal Reserve is going to do, because quite frankly the market has been fighting the Federal Reserve the entire way through the rate hiking cycle. That being said, the question now will probably be whether or not the European Central Bank will continue to be hawkish.</p>
      <p>At this point, they claim that they are going to continue to fight inflation, but that’s the same thing that the Federal Reserve says as well. In other words, it looks like people are paying more attention to and believing the ECB more than the Federal Reserve, and that’s probably the biggest driver of this pair at the moment. Regardless, keeping your position size reasonable is going to be crucial at this point, as we are getting a bit stretched, and of course there is so much noise out there that the market is trying to sort through at the moment.</p>

    	<p>The Euro initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday but continues to see a lot of noise near the 1.09 level, in an area that of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we’ve seen a lot of noise recently. That being said, there’s also a lot of noise above near the 1.10 level, which is eerily reminiscent of the GBP/USD pair. Ultimately, I think this is a market that is trying to decide whether or not the US dollar is going to continue to sell off, or if we have peaked.</p>
	    <p>Because of this, and the fact that we have a lot of PMI numbers coming out on Friday, I anticipate that this market is probably going to hang out in his general vicinity for a while, therefore I think it’s more or less going to be sideways chop over the next couple of days. If we do break down below the 1.09 level, then it opens up the possibility of a drop down to the 1.08 level, followed very quickly by the 50-Day EMA. On the other hand, if we turn around and rally from here, we need to take out the high to get super bullish, and at that point in time I think that the Euro will probably go looking to the 1.1250 level, possibly even as high as 1.15 level over the longer term.</p>	
	    <p>A lot of this comes down to the fact that the European Central Bank is still in the midst of its tightening cycle, while it is generally believed that the Federal Reserve is coming to the end. Whether or not that’s actually the case remains to be seen, but at this point there are a lot of stresses in the economy, so traders are trying to jump ahead of the Federal Reserve, but quite frankly if the Federal Reserve does start cutting, that’s not going to be a bullish thing in the end so you may see the Euro spike for a bit, only to turn around and crumble as people rush toward the safety of treasuries. In other words, chop is going to continue to be the way forward.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has had a very choppy trading session on Wednesday, as it looks like we are getting a bit noisy just below the 50-Day EMA. 50-Day EMA is an indicator that obviously will attract a lot of attention, as the market is also near the 0.67 level. Lately, the market has been consolidating between 0.68 level on the top and the 0.66 level on the bottom, in a relatively well-defined trading session. It is also probably worth paying attention to the fact that the 200-Day EMA is near the 0.68 level, so it does provide yet another reason to think that there is a “ceiling” at that area.</p>

	    <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar has had a very choppy trading session on Wednesday, as it looks like we are getting a bit noisy just below the 50-Day EMA. 50-Day EMA is an indicator that obviously will attract a lot of attention, as the market is also near the 0.67 level. Lately, the market has been consolidating between 0.68 level on the top and the 0.66 level on the bottom, in a relatively well-defined trading session. It is also probably worth paying attention to the fact that the 200-Day EMA is near the 0.68 level, so it does provide yet another reason to think that there is a “ceiling” at that area.</p>
	    <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is very sensitive to the commodity markets, and of course the idea of global growth. After all, the Australian economy is essentially built upon the idea of exporting copper, aluminum, iron, and other hard metals to places like China as the world grows or shrinks. As it looks like we are heading into a global recession, it’s difficult to imagine a situation where the Australian dollar suddenly becomes very strong. That being said, you should also keep in mind that the Reserve Bank of Australia chose not to raise interest rates recently, and it does not look like they are anywhere near changing their attitude. With this, I think we will continue to see the Australian dollar someone underperform other currencies, especially the US dollar which still has hiking to go.</p>	
	    <p>Ultimately, this is a situation where I think you stay in this range, but you probably prefer the downside over the upside. However, if you are range bound trader, you could go both ways, as long as you don’t over lever your position in what looks to be like a very noisy market to say the least. The market breaking out of this range obviously could be a significant move, but in the meantime, it doesn’t look like we have the momentum to make that move easily, so therefore you need to be very cautious with trying to get too big too quick when it comes to playing any momentum swing.</p>

	    <p>Ultimately, the 50-Day EMA sits underneath and is starting to rise, so that does offer the ability to see a bit of support in that area as well. Ultimately, this is a market that could go reaching toward the ¥135 level. The market breaking above the ¥135 level opens up the possibility of the ¥137.50 level, which is where the market has seen a lot of selling pressure previously. Because of this, I think it’s likely that we would see that area as a potential ceiling in the market, and therefore you would have to be cautious trying to get long in that area. However, if we were to break above there then it would obviously be a very bullish sign and could send the market racing higher. In that environment, I would fully anticipate that the market is looking to reach the ¥140 level.</p>	
	    <p>Keep an eye on the bond markets of both countries, as the interest rate differential has a huge part to play in this market. You should also keep in mind that the Bank of Japan continues to have a major yield curve control policy and effect, and therefore will have to print currency if rates start to rise again, devaluing the Japanese yen itself. In that scenario, we could see the US dollar, and most other currencies, take off against the Japanese yen if yield start to rise again. Underneath, I would anticipate that the ¥130 level should be rather supportive, and to break down below there could open up the possibility of a move to the ¥127.50 level.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we have broken back above the 1.24 level to begin looking toward the same range that we had been in previously. There does seem to be a lot of noise between 1.24 and 1.25, so I think it is worth paying close attention to what is going on. If we were to break above the 1.25 level, then it’s possible that the market really could take off to the upside, perhaps trying to get to the 1.2750 level.</p>
      <p>That being said, the market is more likely than not going to continue to see a lot of resistance just above, so I don’t necessarily think that we break out quite easily. The fact that there is not a lot of economic announcements until the end of the week probably keeps this market somewhat quiet over the next couple of days, so therefore it’s likely that we could see a lot of back and forth in this general vicinity. Ultimately, this is a situation where I think we are trying to determine whether or not we can finally break out for a bigger move.</p>	
      <p>There are a lot of different reasons to believe that we are on the precipice of something big, not the least of which would be technical analysis. However, a lot of traders out there are trying to bet on whether or not the Federal Reserve will have to loosen its monetary policy. If they do, that obviously would be negative for the US dollar, and it seems as if a lot of people are betting on that being the case. Whether or not that’s actually true might be a completely different argument, but right now it looks as if we are trying to sort things out. If we were to break down below the lows of the last couple of weeks, then the market is likely to go down to the 50-Day EMA, or perhaps down to the 200-Day EMA.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The euro rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as the market continues to probe the ability to go higher. The 1.10 level above is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and therefore it will attract a certain amount of attention. If we were to break above that level, then it’s possible that the market could start to take off again, perhaps going to the 1.1250 level.</p>
	    <p>On the other hand, if we were to turn around and break down below the 1.09 level, then it’s possible that we could go down to the 50-Day EMA, which is sitting right around the 1.08 level. The 1.08 level is an area that has been important multiple times, and of course a lot of headlines will be made if we test that area. If we were to break down below there, then I think you have a real shot at falling down toward the 200-Day EMA, which is currently sitting just around the 1.06 level.</p>	
    	<p>Keep in mind that there are a lot of questions as to whether or not the Federal Reserve will start to loosen monetary policy, and that is part of why the euro has seen so much in the way of strength recently. However, there are a lot of economic concerns out there right now, and you need to be cautious about the economic performance of most major economies. After all, it looks as if we are heading into a recession, and that typically bodes well for the US dollar eventually.</p>	
	    <p>We are essentially working with 2 major themes here, the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to slow down, and the idea that we are going to see a slowing global economy. Typically, what will happen from a historical point of view is that the US dollar takes it on the chin initially, but then starts to strengthen as people race toward safety. Regardless, I think the thing that you can probably count on in this market is going to be a lot of choppy behavior in the short term going forward, with a lot of concerns with both economies going forward, and therefore a lot of money will be flowing into the bond markets.</p>

Ultimately, this is a situation where we will continue to see a lot of choppy behavior, and therefore it’ll be interesting to see where we kick off from.</p>
	    <p>You can make a bit of an argument for a bearish flag, although I do think that it is stretching it a bit to say the least. The market breaking down below the consolidation area could then send this market down to the 0.65 level. If we break down below there, then the market goes down from there. Ultimately, this is a market that I think is more likely than not going to be in a situation where overall traders will wish to fade rallies but in the short term it looks like it’s probably more consolidation than anything else.</p>	
	    <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to the commodities markets, and of course global growth of economies. After all, if the economy starts to slow down, then it’s likely that we would see the Australian dollar suffer as a result. Keep in mind that the Australian economy is highly levered to the export of hard commodities such as aluminum, copper, gold, and the like. It’s also highly levered to the Chinese mainland economy, which does seem to be doing better, so that’s probably the one thing that is working out for Australia at the moment.</p>	
	    <p>Either way, I think you get a situation where you continue to see a lot of volatility and choppiness, so I will be using those 2 levels as a bit of a guide as to where the market may go in the short term, but it still looks a bit heavy, and that the downside may eventually prevail. If it does, we could see a flush lower and a move down to the 0.65 level, perhaps even followed by the 0.64 level.</p>

This is an area where we’ve seen some noise in the past, and therefore it does make a lot of sense that we would see it tested.</p>
    	<p>Underneath, the 50% Fibonacci level has offered a bit of support a couple of times now, so it is an area where you would expect to see the market take off again, assuming that the overall trend remains. On the other hand, if we make a move below that crucial ¥127.50 level, an area that I think defines the overall trend. You can make an argument for a little bit of negativity, due to the fact that squint you can figure out that there is a bit of a bearish flag, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to kick off.</p>	
    	<p>That being said, if we did break down below the ¥127.50 level, the 200-Week EMA is sitting just below the ¥121 level, and that would be the first target. After that, the market could drop all the way down to the ¥116 level. Ultimately, this is a market that continues to be very noisy, as is normally the case. Ultimately, this is a situation where I think you’ve got a lot of questions to be asked about the market, but ultimately, I think you also have to look at the market through the prism of the yield curve control policies coming out of Japan, and of course whether or not the US dollar is strengthening. All things being equal, this is a market that will continue to frustrate traders, but we are coiling up for some type of inertia to be released, and once it is released, things will be very explosive.</p>

	<h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
	<p>The British pound has been all over the place during the trading week, breaking down initially, shooting straight up in the air after that, and then struggling to get above the 1.25 level as retail sales on Friday came out very anemic in the United States, suggesting that perhaps we are going to see more economic trouble than a lot of traders had been expecting. There was a rush into treasuries on Friday, which helped the US dollar pick up a bit of strength as it is a safety currency.</p>
	<p>At this point, the question is which direction do we break out, because the end of the candlestick in both directions could be a signal to go one way or the other. If we break down below the bottom of the candlestick, then we could go looking toward the 1.22 level, where the 50-Week EMA is currently sitting. All things being equal, this is a market that has a lot of inertia trying to build up, and eventually it will get released.</p>	
	<p>If we do break above the top of the candlestick for the week, then the 1.2750 level will be the next target. Anything above there then opens up a potential move to the upside, perhaps as high as 1.30. All things being equal, this is a market that is going to continue to be very noisy, so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. I think given enough time; we will probably have to make a significant decision for the longer term.</p>	
	<p>The next week or 2 should give us answers, but keep in mind that we are right in the midst of a significant amount of noise on the chart, so it does make a lot of sense that you would see volatility pick up over the next several weeks. The market will continue to be very noisy and therefore the only thing that you can do is keep your position size reasonable in order to protect your trading capital. That’s generally true with almost everything that we are dealing with at the moment, and I just don’t see how it changes anytime soon.</p>

    	<p>The British pound has rallied significantly during the course of the week to reach the ¥166 level, an area that of course is the top of the overall range we had been in for a while. Because of this, it’s very likely that we will continue to see this market bounce around, with this area just above offering quite a bit of trouble. Ultimately, the market does look very bullish, but at the same time you can make the argument that it is in fact going to be a situation where we are little overstretched, and it’s obvious that the sellers keep returning to this market every time we get here.</p>
    	<p>On the downside, the 50-Week EMA sets right around the ¥162 level and is rising, perhaps offering a bit of potential support. In that environment, I think you’ve got a situation where the market will probably find plenty of buyers on dips, especially as the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy. As long as that’s the case, the yen related repairs will continue to have a bit of a floor in them, and therefore I think you have to look at dips as an opportunity to pick up value, as the British pound has been one of the better performing currencies around the world. Ultimately, I think we got a situation where the market continues to see volatility, but it certainly looks as if it is favoring the overall upside, but that does not necessarily mean that you need to see some type of major melt up, rather more of a gradual grind.</p>

    	<h3>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The Euro initially pulled back just a bit during the trading week, breaking below the 1.09 level. However, by the end of the week we have seen the market turn right back around to show strength again, as the market participants seemingly are hell-bent on selling off the US dollar. That being said, it is probably worth noting that the retail sales number in the United States came out weaker than anticipated. Because of this, it looks like there’s been a run toward the US dollar and the relative safety of it, and Friday has been a bit of weakness. Whether or not that sticks remains to be seen, but it clearly is a situation where we have a lot of noise ahead of us.</p>
    	<p>Breaking above the 200-Week EMA opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.1250 level, an area that has been important multiple times. In that scenario, we could very well have a move that extends all the way to the 1.15 level, but this would assume that we will continue to see the oversold conditions of the dollar remain. Things are getting a bit stretched, so it would make a certain amount of sense to see a bit of a pullback anyway. With that being the case, you would anticipate seeing a certain amount of value hunters coming into the picture and trying to get long again.</p>	
    	<p>With this, the market is likely to continue seeing a lot of volatility, as traders wish for one thing, but seemingly the Federal Reserve is ignoring them. As long as that’s going to be the case, you could see a lot of volatility in this market, so therefore your position sizing will be crucial. That’s going to be true in this market, and just about anything else you are trading at the moment. The uncertainty out there is palpable, and therefore has created very difficult trading environments for most raters. The 50-Week EMA is just above the 1.06 level, so it might be worth paying close attention to as a potential target as well.</p>

	    <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The US dollar went back and forth during the trading session on Friday as we continue to see a lot of volatility in Forex markets around the world. That being said, the market sits just below the 50-Day EMA, which of course is an indicator that a lot of people will be paying attention to. However, the 50-Day EMA, and the 200-Day EMA for that matter, are both relatively flat so I don’t know whether or not the markets will pay a lot of attention to it. That being said, if we break above there, then it would be sign of strength.</p>
	    <p>On a breakout above the 200-Day EMA, then the market could go looking toward the ¥135 level, which is an area where we had seen resistance previously and have even seen support from time to time. It’s a large, round, psychologically important figure, so that in and of itself will probably have a lot of influence on the fact that it is not only a magnet for price, but it’s also going to offer a little bit of volatility if we get to that area.</p>	
	    <p>On the other hand, if we break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the trading session on Thursday, we could see the market dropped back down to the ¥131 level, an area that has been important previously, and therefore I think it could offer a significant support. If the market were to break down below the ¥130 level, then the very last messages of support would be near the ¥127.50 level, which was where we formed a double bottom.</p>	
	    <p>Ultimately, this is a market that will continue to be very volatile, but at the end of the day I think we get a situation where we will have to pay attention to the bond markets and interest rates, as the market is highly influenced by the 10 year notes from both countries and the differential. Remember, the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy as well, which also has a major influence on this pair.</p>

      <p>The British pound had initially tried to rally a bit during the trading session on Friday but gave back the gains almost immediately after the retail sales number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated, therefore it looks like people are starting to run toward safety, as the Federal Reserve seems to be hell-bent on tightening into an economically weak situation.

    	<p>The British pound had initially tried to rally a bit during the trading session on Friday but gave back the gains almost immediately after the retail sales number came out of the United States much weaker than anticipated, therefore it looks like people are starting to run toward safety, as the Federal Reserve seems to be hell-bent on tightening into an economically weak situation. If that’s going to be the case, then it’s very likely that we will see ripples throughout the financial markets across the world, and ironically could make the US dollar stronger.</p>
    	<p>The British pound of course has been one of the better performing currencies around the world, so I think at the very least you could probably look at this as a situation where the British pound will probably outperform other currencies against the greenback regardless of how we react from here, but nonetheless it certainly looks as if we are getting a little bit overstretched. The 1.24 level underneath should be support, so if we break down below there, then it would obviously be a very negative turn of events.</p>	
    	<p>If we were to break down below there, then it’s likely that we could go looking to the 50-Day EMA, closer to the 1.2250 level. On the other hand, if we turn around and take off to the upside and break above the highs for the session on Friday, then it’s very possible that the market could go to the 1.2650 level, followed by the 1.2750 level, both areas have seen a little bit of noise recently. At the end of the day, this is a situation where the market probably needs the pullback to find enough value to get involved in this market to the upside. Regardless, this market will probably continue to be noisy, right along with so many others as there are a lot of questions out there about where we are going next. Expect volatility, and size your positions accordingly, as the market seemed very erratic to say the least.</p>

      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) has rallied significantly over the last several days, climbing to a 10-month high against the US dollar.</p>
      <p>Sterling hit $1.2546 on Friday morning, the highest since last June, as the dollar dropped on the foreign exchange markets on hopes that the US Federal Reserve could stop lifting interest rates soon.</p>
      <p>Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, said: “The US dollar continued to weaken on Thursday, mostly against currencies where the central bank still remains hawkish, or the economic backdrop is improving.</p>
      <p>The dollar has come under renewed pressure after more signs emerged that inflation has peaked.</p>
      <p>“Traders are thus betting that the Fed will stop hiking interest rates, and soon it may even start loosening its policy again.”</p>
      <p>The pound was also supported by a speech from Huw Pill, chief economist at the Bank of England, who said the path of inflation “may be bumpier than expected".</p>
      <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: “The pound has hit a 10-month high against the US dollar while EUR/USD has rallied to the highest level since April 2022.</p>
      <p>“Cable (GBP/USD) is up over 3.6% year-to-date and is up over 12% in 6 months since the fiscal fiasco around the mini-budget last September which heavily punished the British currency.</p>
      <p>“Since the lows, the pound has been steadily regaining ground while the US dollar depreciates as traders price in the growing expectation that we are near the peak of the Fed’s rate hiking cycle. After last year’s bull run for the greenback driven by aggressive monetary tightening in the US, 2023 has seen King Dollar lose its crown with the euro and the pound appreciating significantly against it.</p>
      <p>“However there is still a long way to go to revisit the levels of dollar weakness seen at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.”</p>
      <p>Sterling has gained almost once cent this week, and is on track for its fifth weekly gain against the dollar in a row.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The euro jumped to its highest level in more than a year as the dollar dived against its major developed market peers, fueled by increasing market expectations that a worsening US economic situation will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates later this year.</p>
      <p>Europe’s common currency rose as much as 0.7% to $1.1068, a level last seen in April 2022, while the British pound touched a year-to-date high of $1.2537. The New Zealand and Australian dollars were the biggest gainers along with the Norwegian krone and the Swiss franc, while the Bloomberg dollar index declined as much as 0.7% to its lowest mark since early February.</p>
      <p>The moves gained additional momentum in the US morning after producer price index data that showed reduced inflationary pressures. Investors had already turned more confident the Fed will cut interest rates later this year after data Wednesday showed US consumer-price inflation decelerated more than expected and the minutes of the central bank’s March meeting revealed policymakers scaled back expectations for rate hikes this year after a series of bank collapses roiled markets.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of focus on the probability that the Fed could be cutting by the end of the year,” said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank. “The market is celebrating that.”</p>
      <p>The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen more than 10% since reaching an all-time high in September, and after a short-lived rally earlier this year it resumed its downward trend in mid-March, when the collapse of three US lenders sparked fears of a global banking crisis. Tighter financial conditions have led investors to rethink their expectations for interest rates around the world, paring bets on aggressive tightening by the Fed and its main counterparts.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar spiked as much as 1.6% to 0.6797 against the dollar, the highest level since Feb. 24. The Aussie was supported by domestic labor data highlighting economy’s resilience in the face of aggressive rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Swap rates tied to Fed meeting dates suggest that officials are more likely than not to raise rates by another quarter point at their May meeting, but then proceed to lower the benchmark by year-end to a level more than half a point below the current effective fed funds rate.</p>
      <p>The dollar weakness has lifted investor sentiment toward the euro, with three-week risk reversals versus the dollar — a tenor that captures the next monetary policy decisions by the Fed and the European Central Bank — reaching the least bearish levels since February 2022.</p>
      <p>“The markets are expecting further divergence between the hawkish ECB and the peaking Fed,” said Credit Agricole foreign-exchange strategist Valentin Marinov. “That said, I think that the divergence has reached extreme proportions,” noting that he sees growing downside risks to the euro versus the dollar.</p>

      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Thursday, as we have seen the market break above the psychologically and structurally important 1.25 level. This of course is an area that’s going to attract a lot of attention, from both a structural and the psychological point of view. At this point, it certainly looks as if the British pound is trying to do everything it can to continue going higher, but at this point we are also running into a lot of selling pressure. Next couple of candlesticks could be very noisy going forward, so therefore you need to be very cautious.</p>
      <p>That being said, if we do get a significant close on the daily chart above the 1.25 level, it will more likely than not send the British pound toward the 1.2750 level, and then possibly been as high as 1.30 over the next several weeks. However, if we get a sudden “risk off” type of move, that could send the British pound back down to the 1.24 level, which is an area that I would consider to be support after it had been significant resistance previously. That being said, I am a bit cautious about getting overly aggressive one way or the other until we get some type of confirmation candle.</p>
      <p>If we were to turn around and break down below the 1.24 level, that could send this market much lower, perhaps down to the 50-Day EMA which is closer to the 1.2250 level. It is rising, so one would have to assume that there is a certain amount of dynamic support attached to it. That being said, there is probably even more support near the 1.22 level where the 200-Day EMA currently sits. Either way, I suspect that the British pound will continue to be a very noisy currency, as it has been extraordinarily bullish, and of course we have seen a lot of questions about inflation in the United Kingdom. That being said, I do think that the pound will continue to be a little bit better performing against the US dollar than its contemporaries, as we have seen all year long.</p>

However, I think we also have a situation where the noise above is without a doubt a major contributor to a lot of the confusion, and quite frankly hesitation that we will continue to see in the market.</p>
      <p>The ¥166 level has been important multiple times, therefore it’s not a huge surprise to think that it’s an epicenter of trading as we formed a hammer leading up to it, but then saw the level pull price right back to it to show it itself as a bit of a magnet. Ultimately, I think you’ve got a scenario where the market will continue to be a situation where we will see plenty of questions asked about this region, and I think a pullback at this point in time would make a certain amount of sense. That being said, I also believe that a pullback at this point could very well end up being a value proposition as we’ve seen so much strength in the British pound.</p>
      <p>At this point, the market is trying to break out and I think it’s probably only a matter of time before does, simply based on British pound strength. What the Japanese yen does probably remains to be seen, but it should be noted that the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy, but as time goes on, a lot of this is starting to go by the wayside, as yields have dropped. In other words, it appears that the market is probably starting to pay attention to other concerns. With this, I think we’ve got a situation where we will pull back, but there will be plenty of buyers underneath to take advantage of potential value in a market that clearly has a lot of momentum over the last couple of weeks to the upside.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro rallied a bit during the trading session on Thursday, as it looks like we are trying to fight off any US dollar strength yet again. Ultimately, the market has broken above the 1.10 level, but quite frankly the market is sitting near the most recent high, so the question is still whether or not we are going to have a bit of a double top. The next 24 hours could be very crucial as to where we are going to go for the longer term.

However, if we were to break down from here, then the market will more likely than not revisit the 1.08 level.</p>
      <p>Marketers dispenser trying to price in the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to have to change its monetary policy, and of course the ECB is still hawkish at the same time. This does set up for a potential move higher in the Euro, but the question is whether or not it can last a significant amount of time in the economic environment that we find ourselves in. While the inflation situation in the United States is starting to slow down a bit, it still has a long way to go before it would fall within historical norms, meaning that the Fed will probably continue to be tight going forward. Because of this, I think that we need to look at this market from 2 different perspectives.</p>
      <p>The first perspective of course will be whether or not the Federal Reserve can continue to raise rates, and whether or not they sound hawkish. It appears that the financial world is expecting the Federal Reserve to write to everybody’s rescue now that there are some banking issues, but quite frankly even if that were the case, it may put a little bit of downward pressure on the Euro as people go running to the dollar for safety, after the initial selloff.</p>
      <p>The sec. perspective would be that you just simply follow momentum, as markets have run more on momentum than anything else as of late. That being said, expect the volatility to continue.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied again during the trading session on Thursday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA to show signs of life again. At this point, the market looks as if it is going to continue to see a lot of noise between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA, which is about what you would expect under normal circumstances. Ultimately, this is a market that I think is going to have to wrestle with the idea that the global economy is slowing down, despite the fact that it looks like inflation is doing the same in the United States. While that will weigh upon the US dollar, the Australians have already walked away from interest rate hikes, so it does look to me like sooner or later we are going to see this market make a bigger decision.</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied again during the trading session on Thursday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA to show signs of life again. At this point, the market looks as if it is going to continue to see a lot of noise between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA, which is about what you would expect under normal circumstances. Ultimately, this is a market that I think is going to have to wrestle with the idea that the global economy is slowing down, despite the fact that it looks like inflation is doing the same in the United States. While that will weigh upon the US dollar, the Australians have already walked away from interest rate hikes, so it does look to me like sooner or later we are going to see this market make a bigger decision.</p>
      <p>The 0.68 level is a major resistance barrier, and breaking above that, which would also be breaking above the 200-Day EMA, would be a very bullish sign indeed. Alternatively, if we do that then I think the market could go racing toward the 0.70 level, at least until we start to contemplate the idea of a global slowdown. Traders are betting that the Federal Reserve is going to come bail everybody out, and unfortunately with the behavior that we have seen out of the Federal Reserve for the last 14 years, one can hardly blame them.</p>
      <p>I suspect at this point the market is more likely than not to try to work against the US dollar, but keep in mind that it could eventually come back to the dollar as traders run for safety. In other words, volatility is going to be worse, not better. However, in the short term it does look like we’ve made a decision, and therefore I think you got a situation where you have to be cautious with your position size, but clearly the Federal Reserve is just now starting to see its past rate hikes slink through the economy, and therefore I think you got a situation where you probably will have a nice opportunity given enough time to look to the short side, but in the immediate future, momentum is taking over to the upside.</p>

    description: <div className="blog-desc">
      <p>The British pound has initially rallied during the trading session on Wednesday but gave back gains as the Americans came on board. Ultimately, this is a situation where we see a lot of resistance between the 1.24 level in the 1.25 level. With that being the case, it does make sense that we would continue to see a short-term “fade the rally” type of attitude. Furthermore, we have to worry about whether or not the global economy is slowing down, which typically helps the US dollar.</p>

      <p>The British pound has initially rallied during the trading session on Wednesday but gave back gains as the Americans came on board. Ultimately, this is a situation where we see a lot of resistance between the 1.24 level in the 1.25 level. With that being the case, it does make sense that we would continue to see a short-term “fade the rally” type of attitude. Furthermore, we have to worry about whether or not the global economy is slowing down, which typically helps the US dollar.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA is sitting just above the 1.22 level, an area that has caused a little bit of noise in the past. Just below there, we have the 200-Day EMA, so therefore there are a couple of major moving averages below that could be a bit of a target. This of course would need to see the US dollar strength in general, which is a very real possibility considering how many economic concerns there are at the moment.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we do take off to the upside, and close above 1.25 on a daily close, then I might be interested in buying this market, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move to the 1.2750 level. This is an area that has been a bit noisy in the past, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see that area be like a magnet for price. That being said, I think the one thing that you need to pay close attention to is going to be risk appetite, and therefore you can look to other markets to get an idea as to how traders are “feeling” during the trading session. I do believe that the US dollar will continue to see inflows due to the fact that it is where people run toward when they need safety and let’s face it, there are plenty of reasons to look for safety in this environment as it looks like we are heading into a global slowdown, and of course there are still issues with credit out there that demand US dollars.</p>

      <p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday, as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior against the Japanese yen. Ultimately, we are threatening an area where we had a massive “wipeout candle” from previous trading that could come into the spotlight. The ¥166 level is essentially where we are at, and therefore we need to pay close attention to what’s going on.</p>
      <p>This is a pair that is highly sensitive to risk appetite, so therefore you need to be cautious with your position size and recognize that the market could be very noisy to say the least, and therefore you have to look at the longer-term charts. We have gone higher recently, and now it looks like we will probably see quite a bit of upward pressure on dips. I think looking for value on a pullback is probably going to be the best way going forward, so therefore you need to be looking for “cheap British pounds” in order to take advantage of.</p>
      <p>If we do break down from here, the ¥163 level should be support, especially as the 50-Day EMA is racing toward it. That should be an area that a lot of value hunting will occur, and I do think that it would probably be only a matter of time before we got a supportive candlestick that told us it was time to get long again. That being said, if we break down below those moving averages, being the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA just below it, then it could open up a bigger move down to the ¥160 level, which is the bottom of the overall range.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Bank of Japan continues to do its yield curve control policy, meaning that it is going to continue to print yen every time interest rates rise, at least toward the 50 basis point level. Because of this, the Japanese yen will continue to be somewhat soft in general, and it is probably worth noting that the British pound has been one of the better performing currencies of the year. With that in mind, this still looks like a market that the buyers have control of.</p>

      <p>Underneath, the 1.08 level is significant support, and of course we have the 50-Day EMA racing toward it, which will offer even more support as well. With that in mind, it does make for a potential target, but it’s also worth noting that this pair has been extraordinarily choppy, so I don’t necessarily think that it is going to go racing in one direction or the other. While we do have to worry about inflation numbers, the reality is that the global economic situation is starting to deteriorate, that typically will bring money toward the US dollar given enough time. Yes, a lot of traders are out there celebrating the fact that the Federal Reserve may be getting relatively close to the end of its cycle, but the reality is that eventually we begin to worry about safety, just as we have seen in the gold markets.</p>
      <p>In the short term, I would expect a lot of choppy and noisy behavior, but that would be nothing new for this pair. It does tend to be very choppy in general, and I don’t think that’s going to change anytime soon. Because of this, it’s a situation where we should continue to see plenty of volatility, therefore you need to be cautious with your position sizing. Nonetheless, I do think that we are getting a bit stretched so there should be plenty of overhead issues.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, showing signs of life again as we continue to see a lot of noise around the 0.67 level. The 0.67 level is an area that’s been important multiple times in the past, and therefore it’ll be interesting to see how this market plays out in the current environment.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar is highly sensitive to risk appetite and global growth, so you should pay close attention to both of those. The Aussie dollar is highly correlated with the commodity markets, so that is something worth paying attention to as well, as they will have a major influence on where this pair goes.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA sits near the 0.6225 level and is dropping rather significantly. The market currently sees a lot of support near the 0.66 level, an area where we have bounced from. The market continues to see a lot of volatility, and that is going to continue to be the major problem. Ultimately, this is a market that recently had broken down below and uptrend line, so one would have to think there is a little bit of something to that as well, as technical analysis based traders will be paying close attention to it.</p>
      <p>If we can break above there, then it would be a very bullish sign, but ultimately, I think this is a scenario where we are going to see more noise than anything else. Because of this, position sizing will be very crucial, as the volatility could pick up quite drastically. That would be nothing new for this pair, as the Australian dollar does tend to be very noisy in general.</p>
      <p>It’s probably worth noting that the longer-term trend, at least on the monthly chart, is negative. We’ve had a nice bounce recently, followed by a significant fall. At this point, I do think it’s probably only a matter of time before we see a continuation of the downward pressure if all of the global fears of a slowdown come true. Whether or not the market buys it anytime soon remains to be seen, but it’s a story that I think a lot of people are starting to think about, thereby putting negativity in the Aussie.</p>

If we break down below the hammer from the Monday session, then the market is likely to go looking to reach the 50-Day EMA, and then possibly down to the 200-Day EMA.</p>
      <p>The British pound course has been one of the better performing currencies around the world this year, so therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that it is trying to break out. Whether or not it can remains to be seen, but at the very least we would need to see a daily close above the 1.25 level. If we get that, then it’s possible that the market is looking to the 1.2750 level above. That being said, we need to see some type of fundamental reason, or massive US dollar so often make that happen. While the US dollar has been sold off rather stringently as of late, it is oversold at this point.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this is a situation where the US dollar will be the main driver, so therefore it’s likely that we will continue to see a lot of volatility, as traders around the world continue to think about the questions of global growth, and of course whether or not safety will be crucial. The Federal Reserve is likely to continue raising interest rates at the next meeting in May, but the question is whether or not they keep raising after that. They are ready to deal with inflation, and therefore people are expecting the Bank of England to remain tight, but at the end of the day, the Federal Reserve has been screaming from the mountain tops that they are going to stay tight regardless. The question now is whether or not we are breaking out of the range that I have marked on the chart, or if we are simply at the top of the range and getting ready to pull back.</p>

As long as the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control scheme, it will put downward pressure on the Japanese yen. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, but we are a bit stretched at the moment so a little bit of a pullback does make a certain amount of sense.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, this is a market that I think continues to make a lot of noise, but you certainly would struggle finding a reason to short this market with any type of gusto or super conviction. Alternatively, this is a situation where if you are patient enough, you should be able to find plenty of value going forward.</p>

The question at this point is going to be whether or not we are forming some type of double top, and if the US dollar is going to start to strengthen again.</p>
      <p>Even if we did break down from here, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the Euro is going to fall apart. After all, you would have to deal with the 1.08 level as potential support, right along with the 50-Day EMA indicator shortly thereafter. After that, then you are talking about the 200-Day EMA which is right around the crucial and psychologically important 1.05 level. In other words, there are a lot of things that can happen on the way down, but at this point, it looks like the Euro is going to struggle to continue going higher. The question now is whether or not this will become an important double top.</p>
      <p>A lot of this will more likely than not come down to risk appetite, as we have seen multiple times in this pair. Just above, we have the 1.10 level which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where a lot of people would be paying close attention to the Euro in general. If we were to take out that level significantly, then it opens up a much bigger move to the upside, perhaps reaching all the way to the 1.1250 level.</p>
      <p>A lot of things have happened over the last couple weeks it could give us a situation where there are so many different outcomes are possible, but at this point I would be very cautious about trying to buy this market, as there is so much in the way of overhead selling pressure. Alternatively, a lot of this will come down to whether or not people are feeling like global growth continues, or if it is going to be a situation where people start running back to the safety of the US dollar.</p>

Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of overhead pressure, and this of course makes quite a bit of sense that we would see this market drought, due to the fact that there has been so much noise in the general vicinity, and of course all of the fundamental reasons that you have to think about the Australian dollar.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar of course is levered to the commodity markets, which by extension are levered to global growth. With this being the case, the market is likely to see a lot of hesitation, as inflation is raging across the world and while it can be good for commodities, the reality is we are also seeing a lack of growth. A lack of growth obviously will drive down demand for a lot of the assets to come out of Australia such as iron, aluminum, copper, etc. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Australian dollar is highly levered to the Chinese economy, so you need to pay close attention to it</p>
      <p>If we do break above the 0.67 level, then we could see a run toward the 50-Day EMA, which is sloping lower and will more likely than not cause a bit of technical resistance. After that, we have the 200-Day EMA which is near the 0.68 level, which is the top of the previous range. The 200-Day EMA is obviously an important technical indicator that people pay attention to, so that of course is going to come into the picture as well. All things being equal, this is a market that I think you continue to fade rallies, and if we can break down below the 0.6550 level, it opens up quite a bit more selling, down to the 0.64 level, followed by the 0.63 level after that. Ultimately, the US dollar course is a currency that people run toward in times of fear, which I think is part of what we are seeing.</p>

    	<p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee declined past the key psychological mark of 82 per dollar on Tuesday on likely corporate outflows and importer demand for the greenback, traders said.</p>	
    	<p>The rupee finished at 82.1250 to the dollar, having declined up to 82.15 during the session. It closed at 81.98 in on Monday.</p>	
    	<p>Persistent dollar-buying when the dollar index is weaker indicates there is an outflow, a trader said.</p>
      <p>However, dealers couldn't identify the nature of the outflow. They also cited importer demand through the session.</p>
      <p>A move towards 82.20 could set the rupee for further weakness, they said.</p>

    	<p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
    	<p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to see a lot of volatility. At this point, it looks like the market is trying to figure out what to do next, but quite frankly this is a situation where we have dug into a major resistance barrier between the 1.24 level in the 1.25 level. Ultimately, we have to ask questions as to whether or not the US dollar is going to strengthen or weaken, and of course we have to determine whether or not risk appetite will still be out there. After all, there are a lot of different moving pieces at the moment, but we also need to keep in mind that there are multiple reasons why the British pound or the US dollar my strengthen.</p>	
    	<p>Looking forward, if we can break above the 1.25 level, then it is likely that this market takes off. If it does, then the 1.2750 level might be the next target, perhaps even to the 1.30 level given enough time. Ultimately, I think this is a scenario where this is going to be about risk appetite more than anything else. The Federal Reserve has at least one more interest rate hike ahead of it, so now the question is going to be whether or not there are more than just one.</p>	
    	<p>Recently, the 50-Day EMA has broken above the 200-Day EMA, showing signs of strength in what is typically known as a “golden cross.” That being said, the market is more of a “buy on the pullback” type of market going forward, therefore it looks like looking at this chart, this is a market that is going to continue to see plenty of volatility, but I think given enough time we probably have to make bigger decisions. A breakdown below the 1.2350 level opens up the possibility of a move down to the 50-Day EMA, which is closer to the 1.22 level. Underneath there, then you have the 200-Day EMA that comes into the picture as well, which of course will typically attract a lot of attention. With this being the case, I think you need to be very cautious with the position size, as we are about to make a bigger move.</p>

      <p>The British pound initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Monday, but then turned around to show signs of strength as the Japanese yen started to lose strength against currencies across the board.

    	<p>The British pound initially pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Monday, but then turned around to show signs of strength as the Japanese yen started to lose strength against currencies across the board. It’s worth noting that we are getting close to the top of the overall range, with the ¥166 level offering a significant resistance barrier. That being said, the market is more likely than not going to be very noisy and have to deal with a lot of selling pressure just above.</p>	
    	<p>If we do pull back from here, the 50-Day EMA sits near the ¥162.50 level, and has recently just crossed above the 200-Day EMA. Ultimately, this is a market that looks as if it will find plenty of buyers on dips, based upon the recent action that we have seen in this market, and therefore I think it’s more or less going to be a situation where you will be looking for buying opportunities. However, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of risk appetite moves, so I think at this point you will probably have to count on a lot of volatility more than anything else. With this, I think you need to be cautious with your position sizing, but if and when we can break above the shooting star that we formed last week, then I think the market has more of a shot of going “buy-and-hold.”</p>	
    	<p>If we were to break down below the moving averages, then it opens up the possibility of a move to the ¥160 level underneath, which is an area that is previous support, and of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that will make for good headlines. However, it’s probably worth noting that the most recent pullback was much shallower than the previous one suggesting that more pressure is building to the upside than anything else in this pair. If interest rates start to rise, keep in mind that the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy, thereby putting a lot of pressure on the Japanese yen.</p>

      <p>The Euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Monday but gave back gains above the 1.09 level as we continue to see a lot of overhead resistance. The market has seen quite a bit of noise recently, so it does make a certain amount of sense that the Euro could struggle a bit. Ultimately, I think that we are in the midst of potentially trying to form some type of double top, perhaps showing just how difficult it’s going to be to get above the 1.10 level. If we do break down below the 1.08 level, then it’s very likely that we will continue going lower. I understand that the 50-Day EMA is coming into the picture, as it is near the 1.0750 level and rising.</p>

    	<p>If we break down below the 50-Day EMA, then it would make a certain amount of sense that we would see a bigger drop down to the 200-Day EMA, which sits right around the 1.0550 level, perhaps down to the 1.05 level. Ultimately, this is a market that I think is a situation where a lot of buyers would come back into this picture. If we were to break down below the 1.05 level, then the market is likely to drop rather significantly from there, as it has been a rather important support level recently.</p>	
    	<p>This is a situation where the sellers have a lot to prove, but quite frankly the market is likely to continue to see a lot of significant volatility as we continue to see a lot of questions around the world about global growth, and of course the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at the next meeting in early May, but the question now is whether or not they will continue to raise rates. While the European Central Bank is almost certainly going to be a situation where we are probably going to see a lot of upward pressure on interest rates, but given enough time I think we’ve got a situation where risk aversion could send the US dollar into a much stronger position, but right now I think we’ve got a lot of choppiness so keep your position size reasonable.</p>

    	<p>Furthermore, we have to worry about the idea of whether or not there’s going to be global growth, and quite frankly it’s a situation where the reaction by the Australian dollar is going to highly mimic what we are seeing in the commodities market as global growth demands commodity consumption. That being said, it’s worth noting that the Reserve Bank of Australia chose to sit tight during the last interest rate decision, so it does suggest that the Australians will be at the end of their interest rate hiking cycle.</p>	
    	<p>The 50-Day EMA sits right around the 0.6750 level and is starting to drop. That will be a technical resistance barrier, as the market continues to see a lot of negativity over the longer term. That being said, I do think that if we break above here, then you could see a move looking toward the 200-Day EMA, which is just above the 0.68 level, an area that has been important multiple times. That being said, it’s probably worth noting that in limited trading on Monday, the rally did run out of momentum, and we gave back about half of the gain by the time we got to the United States trading.</p>

    	<p>The US dollar initially fell during the trading week to reach down to the ¥131 level, an area that of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area where we have seen support multiple times. The market turned right back around to show signs of life, and we ended up forming a hammer-shaped candlestick for the week. That being said, this is a market that has a lot of noise around it, and of course, you have to keep an eye on several moving pieces.</p>	
    	<p>The first thing you need to keep an eye on is the fact that the Bank of Japan has its yield curve control in full effect, meaning that they are willing to print unlimited yen in order to keep the 10-year JGB interest rate at 50 basis points or lower. This is exactly what caused so much trouble for the Japanese last year, but now the rates are starting to fall across the world, and it has released some of that pressure. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve continues to have its hands full as we worry about inflation in the United States, and of course, traders are betting in both directions at the moment as to what the Federal Reserve is going to do. Ultimately, most traders are starting to come around to the idea that the Fed is going to loosen monetary policy, and the Fed Funds Rate is starting to price in an astronomical amount of interest rate cuts later this year. Whether or not that actually happens is a completely different question of course, and the Federal Reserve of course vehemently denies this.</p>	
	    <p>That being said, if we break down below the ¥131 level, then it’s likely that we could go down to the ¥127.50 level, an area that has formed a bit of a double bottom recently. If we were to break down below there, then the market will certainly fall quite drastically from there. On the other hand, if we turn around and take out the ¥134 level, then we could go looking to the ¥136 level, but it would take a bit of effort to get there. I suspect that the next couple of weeks are going to continue to be noisy.</p>

Breaking through all of that would be very bullish, and would send the British pound into a bullish phase, perhaps all the way to the 1.37 level.</p>	
    	<p>The British pound has been one of the better currencies to own this year, and at this point, it’ll be interesting to see if that changes anytime soon. After all, we are starting to see serious concerns about global growth and inflation, so risk appetite is going to be a bit of a moving target. Underneath, the 50-Week EMA sits at the 1.22 region, so that could be supported. On the other hand, the 1.2660 above is significant resistance, and we just started to pile into the resistance region, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we’ve seen a little bit of a pushback. Whether or not that continues remains to be seen, but right now it seems as if we are content to simply hang around in this area.</p>	
    	<p>Keep in mind that this coming week could be a bit volatile, in reaction to the Non-Farm Payroll announcement in the United States as most of the liquidity would have been taken out of the market on Friday, and then again in Europe on Monday. Regardless, we have a handful of levels to pay attention to, and I do think it is probably only a matter of time before we make a decision as to whether or not we are going to truly break out or pull back toward the bottom of the overall consolidation area that we have been in for the last couple of months. Keep your position size reasonable, this is going to continue to be a very volatile and choppy market, right along with the rest of the Forex world. The most important thing you can do is practice sound money management in this environment.</p>

      <p>The British pound has rallied during the trading session on Tuesday to pierce the 1.25 level. The 1.25 level is an area of significant psychological importance, and we had been looking at this chart through the prism of meeting the resistance between the 1.24 level in the 1.25 level. The question now is whether or not we can continue to go higher, because if we do it would be a major breakout for a longer-term move from everything I can see on the charts.</p>
      <p>However, if we turn around and give this up, it could be a sign that this is a barrier that simply cannot be broken. In that scenario, we would see the market drop to the 1.23 level more likely than not, and then perhaps down to the moving averages underneath. Speaking of moving averages, the 50-Day EMA has broken above the 200-Day EMA in the so-called “golden cross.” Ultimately, longer-term “buy-and-hold” traders are attracted to this type of setup.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that a lot of this comes down to the Federal Reserve and what traders think it will do, as there is a sizable amount of the population that thinks the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates rather soon, so they are trying to price in a weaker US dollar. That being said, the reason the Federal Reserve would have to cut would be due to recession. Over the longer term, the US dollar tends to perform fairly well in these recessions, because although interest rates will drop, the reality is that there is very little in the way of global growth to support other currencies.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the most important thing you can do is pay attention to what the market is actually doing, not what it “should be doing.” I think as traders we all make this mistake from time to time. That being said, if we get a daily close well above the 1.25 level, you have to assume that the British pound will continue to go much higher, but we will have to wait and see.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied significantly during the trading session on Tuesday to breakout to a fresh, new, high. The market has broken above the ¥166 level, and now is threatening the top of the major wipeout candlestick after the Bank of Japan announced that they were going to allow the 10 year JGB to rise to 50 basis points instead of 25. Now that we have made a complete “round-trip”, it suggests that the Japanese yen will continue to lose ground against most currencies. This currency pair had been a bit of a laggard until the last couple of days, and now looks as if it’s ready to lead the charge against the Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>That being said, the market is entering an area that is very noisy, so I don’t think that it’s simply going to take off to the upside. That being said, as long as we can stay above the ¥164 level, then it’s likely that we could have buyers on dips going forward. Alternatively, you should also pay attention to the fact that the 50-Day EMA is starting to shift to the upside, breaking above the 200-Day EMA. The so-called “golden cross” is an indicator that a lot of longer-term players in the market watch, but it’s also worth noting that the moving averages had been flat previously, so it’s still a little early to call for some type of longer-term breakout.</p>
      <p>Going forward it’s more likely than not going to be a situation where you’re looking for value, and of course paying attention to interest rates. As they rise, the Japanese yen takes it on the chin, as the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control monetary policy. Keep in mind that this pair is somewhat turbocharged compared to many others, so even if you aren’t trading this one, and gives you a good idea as to where other yen related pairs might be going. In other words, you could think of it as a secondary indicator in a market that is all about interest rates at the moment. Furthermore, the market has formed a very strong looking candle, so it does suggest that there’s probably plenty of interest.</p>

      <p>The Euro has initially shot higher during the course of the trading session on Tuesday, breaking above the 1.09 level. That being said, the market is in an extreme high, so it’ll be interesting to see if we can hang onto these gains. The US dollar of course is suffering at the hands of traders expectations of the interest-rate markets, and whether or not they are going to continue to see interest rates possibly fall going forward in America. If that’s going to be the case, then obviously it works against the US dollar. However, the Federal Reserve has reiterated that inflation is nowhere near where they wanted to be, so I do think that the market will probably end up being somewhat disappointed.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it doesn’t really matter what the fundamentals are if the price doesn’t agree. Because of this, I’ll be watching very closely the area between the 1.09 level and the 1.10 level. This area has been very difficult to overcome in the past, so one would have to assume there is a certain amount of selling pressure here. If we were to break down below the bottom of the Monday candlestick, that would obviously be very negative, and could send this market reeling. Speaking of which, it is a bit interesting to see just how deep we plunged during the day on Monday at one point.</p>
      <p>I would expect a lot of choppy and noisy behavior over the next several sessions as we try to sort everything out. Keep in mind that Friday is Good Friday, and of course we have to think about the idea of the market trying to sort out the idea of a holiday and the Non-Farm Payroll announcement comes out at the same time. Ultimately, this could set up a rather strange week. Furthermore, as most markets will be closed on Friday, it might just be a matter of being in a bit of a holding pattern between now and then. The Euro has its own issues, but at this point it looks like the ECB is going to continue to see a reason to be hawkish as well, so at the end of the day, it could just be a bit of a wash.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has gone back and forth during the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now hanging around the 50-Day EMA.

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has gone back and forth during the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now hanging around the 50-Day EMA. The question is whether or not we are going to break out to the upside, as the 0.68 level has been a bit of a major barrier for some time. The fact that we pierced that level and then turned around suggests that perhaps we aren’t quite ready to go higher. If we break down below the lows of the day, it’s possible that we could go down to the 0.6650 level. That’s where we took off from during the previous session, and therefore one would have to assume there is a significant amount of demand in that region.</p>
      <p>The 0.68 level being broken to the upside makes a move toward the 200-Day EMA. If the market were to move above the indicator, then it opens up a longer term uptrend. I would also expect to see a move towards the 0.70 level. I do think this is a situation where the risk appetite will have a lot to do with what happens next, but it’s worth noting that the RBA sat still overnight, so it suggests that perhaps interest rate differentials won’t have much to say.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to the commodity markets, and of course global growth. At this point, it seems like it’s a bit of a mixed picture across the board, so I think you will continue to see a lot of volatility in this pair. The Australian dollar also represents a certain amount of risk appetite, so you have to be willing to keep that in mind as well. It does make a certain amount of sense that we would consolidate in this area, because it has been so important. However, if we can get a reasonable impulsive candlestick, then it could give you an idea as to which direction we are going, and then it’s simply a matter of following the momentum in this market. The momentum has been contained for a while, and the fact that we reversed after the massive shot higher on Monday suggests that it will remain so.</p>

      <p>The Euro has rallied significantly during the trading week to test the 1.09 level, an area that has been resistance previously, extending to the 1.10 level for selling pressure. Ultimately, this is a market that will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior in general, and therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that we could fall from here. If we do, then it’s possible that the market could go down to the 1.07 level, followed by the 1.06 level, both of which are areas that we’ve seen a little bit of support at.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind that the interest-rate situation in the United States continues to be parsed, and of course traders are still trying to figure out whether or not the Federal Reserve is going to continue to see a reason to tighten monetary policy. Ultimately, this is a situation where we also have to worry about risk appetite, because if things get truly ugly, the US dollar continues to see money running into the currency to get into the bond market for safety.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we do turn around and break above the 1.11 level, then it opens up a much bigger move to the upside. While this has been a big move higher, I also recognize that we are still below the 200-Week EMA, and of course have had a nice bounce, but were still just around the 50% Fibonacci level of the overall selloff that happened previously. Another thing to be concerned about is the fact that there are still quite a few issues in the banking sector, giving you the likelihood of the US dollar being a safe haven going forward.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit against the US dollar during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see major resistance just above. After all, the market had formed a double top near the 1.24 level, and it looks as if there is significant resistance that could extend all the way to the 1.25 level. After all, the 1.25 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that has shown itself to be important in multiple times.</p>
      <p>Underneath, we have the 200-Day EMA which sits just above the 1.21 level, which is also intertwined with the 50-Day EMA. That should offer a significant amount of support, so if we do break down from here, that might be the first area where you start to see buyers pushback. After that, we then have the 1.20 level, which has a significant amount of psychology attached to it, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. Underneath that level, then we look at the 1.1850 level, an area that has already shown itself to be important in a couple of times in the somewhat recent past.</p>
      <p>Looking at the longer-term chart, it seems as if we are trading between 1.24 on the upside and 1.1850 on the downside. Because of this, I’m looking for some type of exhaustion just above the start shorting again, but I do recognize that if we were to break above the 1.25 handle, then it’s very possible that we could go looking to the 1.2750 level above. After that, then we would go looking to the 1.30 level. If we do break above the 1.25 level, it’s very likely that we would see the US dollar falling against most major currencies in general, so it would be a market wide move.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, a lot of this will come down to risk appetite, as the US dollar is considered to be a safety currency. We have seen this move a couple of times recently, and each time there is selling pressure that enters the market. I suspect that we are going to see more of the same going into the short-term future.</p>

      <p>The British pound initially fell against the Japanese yen during early trading on Tuesday, as we continue to see a lot of choppy behavior in the Forex markets. It’s worth noting that the pair is highly sensitive to risk appetite, but more importantly is paying close attention to the Japanese bond markets as of late. Remember, the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy, meaning that they are trying to keep the 10 year yield down to 50 basis points or lower. Currently, they do not seem to have a lot of problems doing so, but every time interest rates around the world rise, it puts a bit of pressure on the Japanese yen as they will have to print more yen to buy more bonds.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the British have reiterated their need to fight inflation and not worry so much about the banking crisis. In other words, they are going to continue to be tight with monetary policy, and therefore it’s likely that the British pound will continue to be somewhat elevated. The 200-Day EMA sits just above, and of course will attract a certain amount of attention, but at the moment it seems as if the market is going back and forth in this range, as the moving averages are essentially flat, and therefore it suggests that we don’t have any conviction one way or the other.</p>
      <p>That being said, the market is likely that we go higher rather than lower, as long as the trendline stays intact. That’s all the way down at the ¥157.50 level, so we are a long way from breaking the trend in general. That being said, the market is likely to see a lot of noise above, so I think the market is going to be one that you have to look at through the prism of range bound trading, as there are a lot of questions as to what the economic health of the world is at the moment. The ¥165 level above looks to be like a hard ceiling also, so pay attention to that.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we have seen resistance again at the 0.67 level, an area where we’ve seen a lot of action in the past.

In other words, this is more or less going to be a “fade the rally” type of market.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to the commodity market, as Australia is a huge exporter of hard commodities such as copper, iron, and of course gold. With that in mind, it’s probably worth paying close attention to the idea that the commodity markets are highly influenced by the overall economic health of the world, with the demand for commodities being highly correlated. Furthermore, it also comes down to the health of the Chinese mainland, as Australia sends a majority of its exports to that part of the world.</p>
      <p>If we do break to the upside, it’s not until we clear the 0.68 level that I would be impressed with the move. In that scenario, we could see the market going toward the 0.69 level where would run into further resistance. On the other hand, if we turn around and break down from here, we could see the market reaching to the 0.66 level where there is a considerable amount of support. Anything below there then would open up a bit of a trapdoor, allowing the markets to flood to the downside. The overall attitude of the markets. The slowing of choppy confusion, and I think that will remain the same here in the AUD/USD pair, with more or less an eye on the downside more than up. Either way, I’m not expecting big moves in the short term, rather more or less a range bound scenario to continue.</p>

      <p>The Euro has fallen rather significantly during the trading session on Friday to reach down to the 1.07 level. At this point, the market has completely wiped out the post-FOMC burst higher, and now it looks like traders are starting to worry about risk appetite yet again. After all, the entire global economy seems to be threatened, as credit issues are going to be a significant weight around the neck of the markets.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that the 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.07 level, and it is starting to turn higher again. That’s a technical indicator that will attract a lot of attention, but you can also make an argument for the fact that we have failed near the 1.09 level, which is basically where the market had collapsed from previously. At this point, it looks like the Euro is going to continue to see a lot of negativity going forward, or perhaps it should be said that the US dollar is going to be a lot of strength in this type of environment.</p>
      <p>Underneath, the 1.06 level is an area that a lot of people will be paying attention to, and then of course the 200-Day EMA that could offer quite a bit of support that sits just below there. The market breaking down below the 200-Day EMA would of course be extraordinarily negative, so therefore you need to pay close attention to a move like that. In that scenario, we would probably see a resumption of the overall negativity in the market.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we turn around a rally from here, we could get a short-term bounce, but I think at this point in time you need to see the Euro break above the 1.10 level to clearly enter a bullish phase. That of course would probably coincide with a lot of US dollar weakness in general, so pay attention to other currency pairs around the world, because if we see the US dollar falling everywhere, then it will give even more of a boost for buyers in this market. In general, this is a market that will continue to be very noisy, right around this area as we are trying to make a bigger decision.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Friday, which was not a huge surprise considering that we formed a couple of shooting stars during the previous 2 days. The 0.67 level is an area that a lot of people will be paying close attention to, as it has been important multiple times. Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to risk, and there are a lot of concerns that you need to pay attention to around the world, and that does work against the value of a currency like this.</p>
      <p>That being said, it has been rather resilient in the sense that we could have broken down multiple times in the past, so I think more choppy volatility is probably ahead for the market. The 0.67 level has previously been support just a couple of weeks ago, with resistance at the 0.68 level. In other words, there’s a huge block of noise that people will be paying attention to. This is even further confirmed by the 50-Day EMA sitting at the top of it and dropping lower, a technical signal that a lot of people will be using as a directional indicator.</p>
      <p>If we do break down from here, the 0.6550 level is an area where we have seen a significant bounce from, so it should be a certain amount of support, but if we were to break down below there it could send this market much lower, perhaps down to the 0.65 level, maybe even down to the 0.63 level. That being said, when we look at this chart, it’s hard not to notice the fact that the market is trying to bounce a bit, and therefore by the end of the day we may have seen the market turn things completely around. If that is in fact going to be the case, then it’s possible that we could just simply enter a bit of consolidation, but either way, I am not bullish of the Australian dollar and will more likely than not stay that way for the time being, what could change my mind is if we take out the 0.68 level on a daily close.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit against the US dollar early during the trading session on Thursday, breaking above the 1.23 level. 1.23 level is an area that begins the cluster that formed the double top at the 1.24 level. In other words, there will probably be a significant amount of resistance just above, so giving up some of the gains does make a certain amount of sense. After all, the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates, and has reiterated during the session on Wednesday and that they are going to stay tight going forward, even if that means that they have to continue tightening interest rates.</p>
      <p>Looking at this chart, it certainly looks as if we are a little overextended anyway, and the fact that we gave back some of the gains does suggest that perhaps we are ready to start pulling back towards the US dollar. On the other hand, if we were to somehow break above the double top at the 1.24 level, that means that the market would then challenge the psychologically and structurally important 1.25 level. That being said, the market would then start to see the British pound take off to the upside, perhaps kicking off a huge move higher.</p>
      <p>If we break down from here, the 1.20 level underneath would be a large victory for the US dollar, as it is an area that’s been a bit of a magnet for price over the last several months, so it does suggest that perhaps we are going to see a bit of a fight in that area if we do get down to it. Anything under there would then threaten a move down to the 1.1850 level, an area that previously had been major support. That’s essentially the bottom of the overall consolidation area, and if we were to break down below there it opens up a bit of a trapdoor for falling prices. Ultimately, this is a market that looks a little heavy, so I’ll be looking for opportunities to short if there’s any opportunity to do so over the next several days.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro initially rallied significantly against the US dollar during the trading session on Thursday, but has run into a previous selling area, from which we plunged from. At this point, the market is likely to see a bit of exhaustion set in, due to the fact that we went parabolic over the last couple of days. Whether or not the market starts to roll over and turn trends again, that’s of course a different question, but at this point it certainly looks as if we have gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve raised rates just 25 basis points during the session on Wednesday, but at the end of the day there are a lot of concerns around the world about the banking system, and if that’s going to be the case, the US dollar is going to be at a premium. This area that we are in right now is an area that had been so bearish previously that one would have to assume that there should be a significant amount of selling pressure.</p>
      <p>If we do break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the trading session on Thursday, then it’s likely that we could go down to the 1.08 level, an area that has been previous resistance. On the other hand, if we can rally above the top of the range for the Thursday session, we may try to threaten the 1.10 level, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that would attract a lot of attention. Anything above there then would kick off the next great leg higher. I think at this point, there are so many different economic issues out there that it’s probably only a matter of time before the US dollar picks up strength again, so it will be interesting to see how they play this out going forward. Regardless, I would not be a buyer all the way up here without at least seeing the market consolidate for a while as I don’t like to chase trading positions after a market has made such a sharp move.</p>

      <h3>In this article:</h3>
      <p>The Bank of England (BoE) has raised the UK interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 4.25% to combat double-digit inflation.</p>
      <p>This is the 11th time in a row, in less than 18 months, that the central bank has increased rates, making borrowing costs higher despite the cost of living crisis that has hit UK households.</p>
      <p>It lifts UK interest rates to their highest since October 2008, early in the financial crisis, when Bank Rate was 4.5%.</p>
      <p>It also comes after inflation took a surprise leap to 10.4% in February. Inflation hit a 41-year high at 11.1% in October.</p>
      <p>The monetary policy committee voted 7-2 in favour of a 25bps increase, with two members preferring to maintain at 4%.</p>
      <p>Seven members (governor Andrew Bailey, plus Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of raising Bank Rate by a quarter-point, to 4.25%.</p>
      <p>But two members, Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro, voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 4%.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Casey, investment strategist at wealth manager Evelyn Partners, said: “The split in voting is indicative of the tricky state of affairs confronting the MPC and other central banks, with committee members having to weigh the fragility of the global banking sector against the need to bring inflation back to target.</p>
      <p>“The recent turmoil in the banking sector, which began with collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) nearly a fortnight ago, has reminded central banks that things can break when monetary policy is rapidly tightened. Although contagion risks from the tech bank crisis and Credit Suisse look to have receded for the time being, the BoE will need to tread carefully if it decides to further tighten monetary policy from here. The Bank recently acknowledged that ‘more sharp moves in asset prices could expose weakness in parts of Britain’s financial system’ in a letter to lawmakers."</p>
      <p>This increase will have an immediate impact on some borrowers and savers. High-street banks use the Bank's base rate to work out the interest rates it offers to customers.</p>
      <p>Sam Richardson, Which? money deputy editor, said: "This rate rise will push up housing costs for already hard-pressed households – with millions more likely to be hit over the coming months.</p>
      <p>"Those on a tracker mortgage will see an immediate impact on monthly repayments, and those on a variable rate could also see their costs rise. Mortgage owners on a fixed-term deal will not be affected for the duration of their deal, however they will likely be stung with much higher rates when the time comes to renew.</p>
      <p>"Homeowners struggling with payments should speak to their lenders, which are required to offer support, such as temporarily reducing payments or extending the mortgage term. Discussing your options with your lender will not affect your credit rating.</p>
      <p>"Higher rates will also have an impact on renters, as buy-to-let landlords will likely pass on increased costs to their tenants. If you are unsure about how you will be able to make monthly repayments, contact your landlord or letting agent to see if a different payment plan is available."</p>
      <p>The Bank of England says up to 4 million households face a higher monthly mortgage bill this year. An estimated 356,000 mortgage borrowers could face difficulties with repayments by July next year, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
      <p>When interest rates rise, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments.</p>
      <p>For the average UK property costing £270,708 on a variable rate and with a 75% LTV, monthly mortgage repayments would increase by £26 a month, according to data from TotallyMoney and Moneycomms.</p>
      <p>Three-quarters of mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage so their payments should not be affected for now but prospective house buyers or those seeking a remortgage will pay more.</p>
      <p>Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said: "For first-time buyers shopping around for a fixed rate deal, another interest rate rise will leave them feeling very nervous. Mortgage rates rose rapidly last year – hitting a peak of 6.5% in October in the wake of the mini budget chaos when unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets. Despite interest rates continuing to rise since then, the average two- and five-year fixed rates are currently at a six-month low as most of the recent Bank Rate rises were already priced in by lenders."</p>
      <p>Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla, commented: "We don't expect the increase in the base rate to make much difference to the outlook for the housing market. Demand for homes is down on last year but sales are still being agreed albeit at a slower rate (20% lower). People still want to move and households are resetting their plans in an environment of higher borrowing costs. Talk of a big price correction in home values has been overplayed and if you price your home sensibly, it’s likely to attract interest subject to some negotiation on the final price."</p>
      <p>The Bank of England said in its latest monetary policy report that global growth "is expected to be stronger than projected" in its last meeting and that the UK banking system "remains resilient".</p>
      <p>Markets predict this to be the final rate hike in the Bank of England’s run.</p>
      <p>"Assuming the broader inflation data continues to point to an easing in pipeline pressures, then we suspect the committee will be comfortable with pausing by the time of the next meeting in May," ING economist James Smith said.</p>
      <p>The BoE has raised its outlook for the economy in the near term, now expecting the economy to grow in second quarter.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “With rising prices strangling growth and eroding family budgets, the sooner we grip inflation the better for everyone.</p>
      <p>“That's why we support the Bank of England's actions today and why we will continue to play our part in this fight by being responsible with the public finances, alongside providing cost of living support worth an average of £3300 per household over this year and next.”</p>
      <p>The Bank of England follows other central banks in rising interest rates amid sticky inflation and an international banking crisis.</p>
      <p>The US Federal Reserve raised its main rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday but indicated it would stop further increases.</p>
      <p>The European Central Bank also raised its three main interest rates by 50 basis points last week.</p>
      <p>This Thursday, the Swiss National Bank’s policy rate has been lifted to 1.5%, from 1%, to counter “the renewed increase in inflationary pressure”.</p>
      <p>The Norges Bank’s Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee also announced today it had decided to raise the Norwegian policy rate from 2.75% to 3%, as it battles inflation.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday as we are waiting for the FOMC meeting results. Obviously, the FOMC will have a major influence on what happens with the US dollar next, and therefore have a major influence on what happens with most major forex pairs. Currently, it looks as if we are getting close to the top of the range that we have been in, and therefore we will have to make some serious decisions. The 1.23 level sits just above, which is a short-term resistance barrier.</p>
      <p>After that, then we have the 1.24 level, an area where we had formed a major double top, and therefore it will be interesting to see if that holds on any type of big move to the upside. The 1.24 level begins an area that extends to the 1.25 level, so it’s obvious that there are a lot of things above that could come into the picture and cause problems. Keep in mind that the market has been chopping back and forth for a while, and therefore one would have to assume that we could keep doing that.</p>
      <p>The 200-Day EMA sits just below the 1.2150 level, with the 50-Day EMA sitting just below there as well. However, that’s not the bottom of the range that I’m looking at, and it extends all the way down to the 1.1850 level. All things being equal, this is a market that is more likely than not going to stay in this range, and as we are closer to the top than the bottom, unless we get some type of extraordinarily dovish statement or action out of the Federal Reserve, which could send the dollar plunging.</p>
      <p>However, at this point it’s all speculation and we need to see what ends up being the case with the Federal Reserve and what they are going to do. With this, a lot of caution will be needed, but if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 basis points and sounds like they are still looking to fight inflation, one would have to anticipate that the double top above will hold.</p>

      <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday to test the 1.08 level. The 1.08 level is an area that previously has been resistance, so it should be well known as an area that we could struggle at. Furthermore, the Euro has rallied rather drastically over the last couple of days, so you would have to keep in mind that we may see signs of exhaustion, and a FOMC meeting might be the perfect reason.</p>
      <p>The Euro is now heading into an area that has been sold off rather aggressively, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see hesitation if we did rally. However, the FOMC meeting could change everything, so you need to be very cautious with putting big positions into the market. The market breaking above the 1.08 level would be very bullish, but again, there’s a lot of noise above that could cause significant selling pressure all the way up to the 1.0950 level.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA sits near the 1.0650 level and is rising. The 50-Day EMA is an indicator that a lot of people will pay attention to, so could be dynamic support. Any short-term pullback at this point will more likely than not offer value the people are willing to pay attention to, unless of course the Federal Reserve remains extraordinarily hawkish.</p>
      <p>If that’s the case, then we could see the market could break down and go looking towards the 1.06 level. The 1.05 level underneath there would be massive support as well, and breaking down below that area would also be a break of the 200-Day EMA. That of course is a very negative sign and could send the market much lower. In that environment, we could be looking at a move down to the 1.03 level, perhaps down to the parity level.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this is a market that will be making a lot of decisions over the next couple of days that could be more permanent, but at this point it still looks like there is a lot of trouble above that could keep a bit of a lid on any Euro rally.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied during early hours on Wednesday as we wait for the FOMC meeting results and of course the interest rate situation afterwards.

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied during early hours on Wednesday as we wait for the FOMC meeting results and of course the interest rate situation afterwards. Ultimately, the 0.68 level is major resistance, which extends all the way down to the 0.67 level. This is a situation where we are more likely than not going to cause some issues, and therefore it’s likely that signs of exhaustion will be jumped on.</p>
      <p>The 0.68 level above offers a significant amount of resistance that is now backed up by the 50-Day EMA, so that must be kept in the back of your mind at this point. Even if we do break out above there, the upside is somewhat limited due to the fact that there are plenty of areas of trouble above. That being said, the market will continue to be very noisy, and therefore it’s likely that we see sellers into the market center later. This makes quite a bit of sense considering that the Australian dollar is so highly levered to the global commodity market, which of course is levered to the global growth situation.</p>
      <p>As things stand right now, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of back-and-forth and volatile concerns, meaning that the Australian dollar is probably going to suffer at the hands of US dollar strength. This will be especially true due to the fact that the FOMC meeting will more likely than not introduce another rate hike, and of course the statement and press conference will be paid close attention to as well. If Jerome Powell sounds hawkish, the Australian dollar will more likely than not be a major victim as there will be concerns about global recession, which is very toxic for the Aussie.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have been in a downtrend for a while, so it’ll be interesting to see if this holds up. You could make an argument for a little bit of a rising wedge at the moment, which of course is a bearish candlestick pattern as well. Regardless, I think it’s probably a market that you do not want to be long of, so if you were looking to sell the US dollar against a currency, you may want to do that against another one.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, to reach toward the sea ¥132.50 level. This is the top of the range from the previous session, suggesting that perhaps we are trying to figure out whether or not we can kick off the uptrend again. The 50-Day EMA is starting to break down below the 200-Day EMA, kicking off another bearish signal. Nonetheless, the reality is that both moving averages are essentially flat, and therefore it suggests that we are going to go back and forth.</p>
      <p>The ¥135 level above is a major resistance barrier, but I do think that’s where we attempt to get to before it’s all said and done. This will be especially true when it comes down to what’s going on with the bond market, as the Bank of Japan continues to fight higher interest rates. That being said, interest rates have been dropping as of late, and that’s part of what has pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher at one point.</p>
      <p>Underneath, the ¥130 level is an area where I think a lot of people will be paying close attention to, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. Underneath there, we have the double bottom that formed at the ¥127.50 area. It’s also where the 50% Fibonacci level from the huge move last year, and therefore it makes a certain amount of sense that the market will pay close attention to it. That being said, the most important factor to keep in the back of your mind is that the Federal Reserve has a meeting on Wednesday, and therefore it’s likely that we will be paying close attention to it for hints as to where the Federal Reserve is going next.</p>
      <p>After all, there have been tremors in the global financial system, so a lot of people are hoping that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates very much, or at all. However, with inflation running as rapid as it is, it’s very difficult to imagine a scenario where they do not. As they raise interest rates, rates could very well right across the board, putting more downward pressure on the yen and allow this pair to go higher.</p>

      <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday to reach the 1.08 level.

A lot of this will come down to whether or not Jerome Powell is hawkish or dovish, and what they do as far as interest rates are concerned. There is consensus across the board that nobody really knows, and I think that’s probably part of what you are seeing here.</p>
      <p>While Wall Street and various large firms want the Federal Reserve to stop raising rates, the reality might be something different. After all, they start to worry about inflation, and if they choose to loosen monetary policy again, that will almost certainly kick off even more inflation. That being said, the market has been arguing with the Fed for a while, and now that we have had a couple of banks failed, they believe that the Fed simply “must loosen” sooner than later.</p>
      <p>The market has sold the US dollar as of late, but if Jerome Powell and company surprise everyone, and stay extraordinarily hawkish, that could send this market plunging. I do think that the next couple of trading sessions could be rather important, so therefore we need to be watching how the market behaves. Any sign of exhaustion between now and 1.09 has to be looked at with suspicion, as it’s an area where we have seen an impulsive move lower, as the market started to plunge. It’s probably worth noting that we bounced from the 200-Day EMA, so that of course is a bullish sign, but right now it could be a target if we break down. On the other hand, if we do rally from here, you need to be cautious of the 1.10 level above, because if we were to somehow break above there, that could open up a huge leg higher in the Euro. That would almost certainly involve the Federal Reserve changing its overall tune.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has pulled back a bit against the US dollar during trading on Tuesday, as traders are going to have to start focusing on the FOMC Meeting for the Wednesday session. After all, the entire world seems to be paying attention to whether or not the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, and by how much. Currently, there is the overall expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise by 25 basis points, but there are some out there that believe it could be 50 basis points, while others believe that they will have to stop raising rates altogether.</p>
      <p>With that being said, the next 24 hours could be a bit lackadaisical, but it’s also worth noting that the area just above is major resistance as well, so therefore I do tend to favor the downside at this point. The market seems to have a block of resistance between 0.67 and 0.68, therefore I would be surprised to get above there before we get to the meeting itself. If we break down below the 0.6650 level, then we could drift down to the 0.66 level. I anticipate that the next 24 hours could be very sideways, so I would not put too much money to work right away. However, it’ll be interesting to see whether or not people are willing to put money to work.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to risk appetite and commodities around the world, so that obviously will have its influence as per usual. Beyond that, risk appetite in general needs to be seen in order for the Australian dollar to really start to rally, so if we get some type a surprise move, that would obviously be very bullish for risk appetite in general. Nonetheless, most of the move that we have seen earlier in the day makes sense, because a lot of people will not want to be overly exposed to price fluctuations as there are too many unknowns. More likely than not, if you are a short-term trader, you are looking at this through the prism of range bound opportunities on short-term charts between now and the meeting.</p>

      <p>UK public sector borrowing hit a new record in February, driven by the cost of the government’s energy support schemes.</p>
      <p>Borrowing, the difference between spending and tax income, was £16.7bn, last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p>
      <p>The ONS said the extra spending on energy subsidies in February 2023 compared with a year earlier was estimated to be about £9.3bn.</p>
      <p>The cost of energy support has now reached about £34bn since it was put in place last October.</p>
      <p>The Treasury kept household energy bills at £2,500 a year on average under its Energy Support Scheme.</p>
      <p>The latest ONS data also revealed that £6.9bn of interest payable on debt also pushed February borrowing higher, although this was down by £1.3bn — the first fall in debt interest payments since April 2021 due to easing inflation.</p>
      <p>Public sector borrowing was the highest February figure since monthly records began in 1993 and higher than the £11.7bn expected by most economists. It takes the year-to-date total to £132.2bn</p>
      <p>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said borrowing was "still high" because the government was supporting households with the rising cost of living.</p>
      <p>Hunt said: “Borrowing is still high because we’re determined to support households and businesses with rising prices and are spending about £1,500 per household to pay just under half of people’s energy bills this winter.</p>
      <p>The ONS said £5bn was raised through the new windfall tax on UK energy company profits. Tax income was also £5bn higher than a year ago at £77.8bn.</p>
      <p>“What will bring these costs right down is lower inflation, which is why it remains one of our top priorities to halve it this year, alongside growing our economy and reducing debt.”</p>

      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee ended little changed on Tuesday, as investors were wary ahead of a pivotal U.S. Federal Reserve bank meeting decision, amid major economies grappling with a banking sector crisis.</p>
      <p>The rupee ended at 82.6550 per dollar, compared to its previous close of 82.6350. It moved in a narrow 15 paisa range all day.</p>
      <p>Initial dollar bids from large state-run corporates and lacklustre trading volumes ahead of the Fed meeting led to the rupee staying contained in a range, said two traders.</p>
      <p>Heading into the risk event, traders said they built "slightly" long USD/INR positions as foreign exchange markets are shut in India on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Asian currencies were flat to marginally higher, tracking a sombre dollar index.</p>
      <p>Focus shifts to the Fed decision, due Wednesday, with investors going back to expecting a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate hike amid relative calm after a crisis emanating from Credit Suisse and U.S. mid-sized lenders had roiled financial markets over the past week.</p>
      <p>Fed funds repricing has been quite volatile off late, and at one point on Monday it indicated higher chances of a pause than a hike, fuelled by global central banks pledging liquidity support in the wake of the banking crisis.</p>
      <p>"A 25 bps move...can either be read as a sign of confidence in the financial sector and a reiteration of the inflation focus or as a policy misjudgement that could accelerate banking troubles," ING analysts said in a note.</p>
      <p>"On the flip side, a hold may either reassure investors or be interpreted as a de-facto sign of alarm."</p>
      <p>Clear direction is possible only from the Fed's commentary and the dot plot, said a foreign bank trader.</p>

      <h3><strong>Yen Demand Catapults as Banking Crisis Wrecks US, Europe Havens</strong></h3>
      <h3>In this article:</h3>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The yen is making a push to regain its crown as the go-to haven as a banking crisis dents the appeal of its US and European peers.</p>
      <p>Japan’s currency has outperformed all its Group-of-10 counterparts in the past five days as traders sought the safest assets amid a surge in volatility. In contrast, a gauge of the dollar sank 0.7% in the immediate aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse while the Swiss franc dropped as much as 2% Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“The yen is being seen as a safe haven again, and there appear to be very few of those at the moment,” said Andrew Ticehurst, a rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Sydney. “With SVB impacting the US dollar as Fed rate hikes get put in doubt, and Credit Suisse impacting ECB thinking and the euro and Swiss franc outlook, the yen can buck the trend.”</p>
      <p>The turmoil in the banking sector is reshaping the outlook for monetary tightening, as investors speculate that the crisis may stay the hand of central banks. Upcoming policy reviews by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are the next event risk, with some investors warning that authorities may continue to tighten to tame inflation.</p>
      <p>The expected peak for the Fed policy rate — which exceeded 5.5% less than a week ago — is down to about 4.85%, pricing in an increase in May, with a quarter-point hike at next week’s review deemed a coin toss. Traders see the ECB opting for a quarter-point increase on Thursday, compared with expectations for a half-point hike last week.</p>
      <p>Analysts are similarly less enthused about the franc as the currency’s fortunes are seen to be closely linked to those of troubled lender Credit Suisse Group AG. The bank is seeking funding from the Swiss National Bank to shore up investor confidence and Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner has said its financial position is sound.</p>
      <p>“The yen seems more popular now than the Swiss franc, which is another safe currency, due to the emergence of the Credit Suisse issue,” said Ayako Sera, strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “Safety is the key word in the market right now.”</p>
      <p>Surplus Challenges</p>
      <p>Still, Japan’s currency has several factors working against it. For one, the nation would probably require overseas money to help fund a record current-account deficit, and this may expose the yen to volatile foreign flows.</p>
      <p>Japan’s ultra-low rates are another worry, and any further Fed tightening may widen the rate gap and unleash another wave of selling in the yen.</p>
      <p>But until that happens, Japan’s currency looks likely to continue attracting buyers for now, strategists said.</p>
      <p>“We see recent developments as USD bearish,” Patrick Bennett, strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, wrote in a note. He forecasts dollar-yen falling to 123 in the third quarter from around 133 now.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied during the course of the week to test the ¥135 level. The ¥135 level of course is an area that has been important multiple times, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have failed there. Nonetheless, the overall candlestick is rather bullish looking, and therefore I think we probably have a little bit of follow-through coming. After all, if the Bank of Japan continues to have to fight interest rates, it’s likely that we will continue to see the US dollar overcome the Japanese yen strength. We also had recently pulled back from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and now it looks like we are ready to go to the upside again. Given enough time, I do think that we probably have a much higher exchange rate.</p>
      <p>If we can break above the ¥135 level, then it is possible that we could go to the ¥137.50 level. After that, the ¥140 level is worth paying close attention to. On the other hand, if we turn around and break down below the ¥130 level, that would probably show quite a bit of negativity, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move down to the ¥127.50 level. You can see that the pullback was rather brutal, but then again, the move higher was brutal to get up there. Now that the Federal Reserve may finally be convincing people that they are serious about keeping interest rates higher for longer, we could very well see this market take off to the upside. Ultimately, this is a market that remains very noisy, but I do think given enough time we probably try to get back to those highs at this rate.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday, to reach the ¥135 level. This is an area that has previously been resistance, and therefore the fact that we broke above that level would have been a very strong sign, but we have given back those gains to show signs of weakness since then. At this point, it looks like we are reaching down to the ¥132.50 level, an area that I think should end up being support. If we can break below there, then it’s likely that this market starts to fall toward the ¥130 level.</p>
      <p>This all began with concerns with Credit Suisse, as Saudi financiers decided that they were no longer going to try to prop up the bank. Now we have to worry about contagion in the banking system, and as a result a lot of money flew into bond markets. Remember, the Bank of Japan is trying to fight higher interest rates right now, so therefore they have to step into the bond market and purchase those bonds with freshly printed in Japanese yen to keep the rates under 50 basis points on the 10 year. On the other hand, if rates start to drop around the world, then it’s likely that there is less pressure on the Bank of Japan, meaning that they will be buying less yen, and then meaning that the Japanese yen will strengthen, which is exactly what we see on this chart.</p>
      <p>The more fear that we have out there, the more likely it is to be a situation where the Japanese yen gets a bit of a boost, and therefore as long as his fear is out there, we may see the Japanese yen be one of the better performing currencies. As soon as the market continues to see a lot of relief, then this market will turn right back around. That being said, these are very dangerous days so don’t be surprised at all that the market would be very volatile and noisy, so in this environment you need to keep your position size relatively small until you get confirmation of your position.</p>

      <p>The ¥160 level has offered a little bit of support, but if we blow through there, it’s possible that the market could go down to the ¥157.50 level. In that area we would more likely than not see a significant amount of support. If we bounce from here, I don’t necessarily think that we are going to see a new bull market, just that we may have a bit of a consolidation area in the short term. Either way, volatility continues to be a major issue, and you will have to keep an eye on your positions. Now is not the time to be complacent with positioning, and therefore it’s crucial that you keep your position size reasonable.</p>
      <p>At this point, the market will continue to be noisy more than anything else, and with that in mind you will have to understand that you need to look at the big picture. We are most certainly in an area that could be important, but it’s also worth noting that the British pound has underperformed against the yen when compared to multiple other currency pairs, so I would assume this might be a market that is softer than many others.</p>

      <p>After Credit Suisse got the news that there was not going to be more of a bailout from Saudi financiers, suddenly there seems to be a concern of contagion in the European Union. After all, the bank has been the epicenter of a lot of problems for the last several years, and without assistance it plunged, sending the CDS market for that bank pricing in a 36% possibility of default. Because of this, it’s very likely that money is flowing away from the European Union as Credit Suisse almost certainly has its fingers all throughout the continent.</p>
      <p>The euro plunged towards the 200-Day EMA, and by the time New Yorkers got to work was down 200 pips. If the market were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, it could open up a new rush of selling pressure, sending the Euro down to the 1.03 level, possibly even down to the parity level. In that environment it is likely that we would see quite a bit of US dollar strength in general, as traders will be looking for safety. It almost certainly means that the market will continue to favor the US dollar as money goes flying towards the US Treasury market.</p>
      <p>If we do rally at this point, it’s difficult to imagine that it sticks anytime soon, with the 50-Day EMA more likely than not offering a little bit of resistance on the way up. Furthermore, the market struggled with the 1.07 area, an area that previously had been difficult to get above. If we break above the 1.08 level, then it opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.10 level, although at this point it seems very unlikely to be the case.</p>
      <p>We recently had seen the Euro rally a bit due to the fact that a lot of traders are counting on the Federal Reserve cutting rates, due to the fact that there was a bailout of the bank in California just a few days ago. However, if the Europeans suddenly find themselves needing to worry about contagion, that essentially makes things “all even”, which of course would be bad all the way around in that environment.</p>

If that’s going to be the case, there will be a run to safety currency such as the US dollar as there will be a run toward the bond market.</p>
      <p>Underneath, the 0.6550 level is an area that has previously been important, so therefore if we were to break through there, it would likely need to send this market down to the 0.64 level. The Australian dollar of course is highly sensitive to risk appetite so I think this continues to be a very noisy situation, as traders hope the Federal Reserve is going to step out and cut interest rates, with the Fed Fund Futures markets suggesting there could be 100 basis points of interest rate cuts by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Any rally at this point in time will have to deal with not only the 0.67 level, but also the 0.68 level. The 0.68 level is a significant barrier, and if we were to break above there it would obviously be a very bullish sign. The 200-Day EMA sits near the 0.6850 level and is dropping at this point. That of course could be a large technical barrier that will be difficult to get above any time soon. It’s also worth noting that we had bounced high enough to hit the 50% Fibonacci level from the massive selloff previously, and now it looks like we are ready to go much lower, perhaps reaching down to the 0.62 level where we had bounced from to begin with. It will be very noisy, but it certainly looks as if the Australian dollar is struggling to find its footing for a bigger move anytime soon.</p>

      <p>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</p>
      <p>The British pound initially plunged during the week to show signs of weakness, reaching down to the 1.1850 level again. This is an area that previously had been support, so the fact that we held there is a good sign. However, it’s also worth noting that we have seen a lot of choppy and noisy behavior as of late, and most of this reaction was due to the Non-Farm Payroll announcement on Friday, perhaps showing a little bit of hesitation in wage pressure. With that in mind, I’m a little less likely to get bullish of the British pound that I would be under normal circumstances, especially as the preceding candlesticks were all inverted hammers.</p>
      <p>I do believe eventually the British pound falls apart, and goes looking to lower pricing against the US dollar, but right now we might be settling on some type of short-term consolidation. If that’s going to be the case, keep in mind that markets can be extraordinarily choppy at times and you need to be cautious with your position size as a result.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the weekly candlestick, then I think it opens up a move down to the 1.15 level, something that I do expect to happen sooner or later. With that, I would be increasingly aggressive to the downside. If we do rally from here, I think there’s a lot of noise near the 1.21 level and the 1.2250 level where the 50-Week EMA currently resides. Either way, volatility is going to be a major issue.</p>

      <p>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</p>
      <p>The Euro has initially fallen during the week, only to turn around to show signs of life again. The 50-Week EMA seems to be attracting a lot of attention, so therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have turned around. Furthermore, we also had the non-Farm Payroll announcement come out on Friday that had people hoping that perhaps the shrinking wage inflation might have the Federal Reserve rethinking its rate of change. That of course is absolute nonsense, but in the short term it seems to be that’s the narrative that Wall Street is playing.</p>
      <p>If we can break higher, there should be a significant amount of resistance near the 1.07 level, and then again at the 1.08 level. On the downside, if we were to break down below the bottom of the candlesticks for the past couple of weeks, then I think you have a situation where you could easily see this market drop down to the 1.03 level, followed by parity. Keep in mind that parity is going to attract a lot of headlines, and therefore people will be very interested in that region. I think we will have a major fight if we do get down to that area, and whether or not we can break down below there is a completely open question at this point.</p>
      <p>At this juncture, I think the only thing you can probably count on is going to be more volatility, which is something that quite frankly I think a lot of traders are sick of. However, until we get some type of certainty when it comes to trading conditions and the economic outlook, this is a beast that we have to deal with.</p>

      <p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gains to show signs of hesitation. At this point, it looks like we are trying to build up enough pressure to go lower, breaking down below the support. The market has continued to fail every time we get close to the 50-Day EMA, so it is more likely going to continue to be a situation where traders are fading the rally, taking advantage of US dollar strength.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA is also backed up by the 200-Day EMA, so therefore I think there are quite a few different players that look to short this market every time it tries to rally. Ultimately, this is a situation where if we can break down below the 1.1850 level underneath, then the market is likely to drop down to the 1.15 level underneath. The 1.15 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we have seen a lot of noise previously. That previous resistance should now end up being supported.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we turned around and took out the 200-Day EMA, then it’s likely that we could go to the 1.23 level. After that, then we have the 1.25 level above, that is where we have the double top, which started at the 1.24 level. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, but I also believe that this is a market that has a major overhang, and therefore it’s going to be difficult for it to go much higher.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is going to remain tighter for longer when it comes to the monetary policy, and therefore it’s likely that we would see the US dollar continue to be strong in general. All things being equal, this is a situation where we continue to see a lot of downward pressure on each rally, and therefore I will be fading each one at the first signs of exhaustion. True, support has held fairly well so far, but it is only a matter of time before it gives way to all of this mounting pressure.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gains near the 1.07 level. The 1.07 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area where we have seen both support and resistance recently. That being said, the market also has been banging around between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which typically will mean that we have a lot of noise out there that is going to continue to be a problem.</p>
      <p>If we were to turn around and break down below the 200-Day EMA, which is basically at the 1.05 level, then it opens up a trap door to much lower prices, perhaps down to the 1.03 level, followed by the parity level. The parity level of course is an area that will attract a lot of attention due to the fact that it is a level that makes for a good headline number. However, I think at this point we’ve got a situation where we have so much in the way of noise and volatility out there that sooner or later the Euro starts to fall. After all, when you look at the chart you can see that we had fallen rather drastically from the 1.10 level. The last couple of weeks have been very noisy, but it’s also worth noting that it was kicked off by a massive shot lower.</p>
      <p>Jerome Powell is speaking during the session, in front of the United States Congress. That could be a mover of markets, but we will have to wait and see. Either way, it looks as if the sellers are going to continue to take hold of this market, especially as we sold off so drastically from the 50% Fibonacci level of the massive selloff that occurred last year. I think we continue to see more of the same, and therefore I think it’s only a matter of time before we go lower. That being said, if we were to turn around and break above the recent highs, that could change everything but I would not hold my breath on that.</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen rather hard during the course of the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now well below the 0.67 level. At this point, the market is looking likely to go down to the 0.6650 level, which is an area where we have seen a lot of previous support. If we were to break down below there, then the market is likely to drop down to the 0.6450 level. Furthermore, we have recently seen the so-called “death cross”, when the 50-Day EMA breaks down below the 200-Day EMA indicator and is generally seen as a negative turn of events. Because of this, I think you got a situation where the market will continue to be more dollar positive than anything else.</p>
      <p>This will continue to be the case as long as the Federal Reserve has decided to be “tighter for longer”, as they have publicly stated. At this point, I think it’s only a matter of time before rallies get sold into at the first signs of exhaustion. With that being said, I like the idea of fading these rallies and taking advantage of momentum, as it continues to see a lot of noise. The Australian dollar of course is a very sensitive currency when it comes to global growth and of course the Chinese mainland, both of which are a bit shaky at the moment, despite the fact that the Chinese have less than desirable numbers at times.</p>
      <p>The size of the candlestick does suggest that there is a significant amount of downward pressure building in this market, so I do think that a breakdown is only a matter of time before it actually happens. Rallies at this point will more likely than not be sold into at the first signs of exhaustion, and it would take the market breaking above the 200-Day EMA for me to change my opinion on this pair. All things being equal, I think the US dollar continues to be one of the favorite currencies around the world, and therefore I do believe that the Aussie will continue to be threatened by the juggernaut that is the greenback.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the course of the trading session on Monday, as it looks like it is still trying to figure out what to do with itself. Because of this, the market will be very noisy, but ultimately it looks as if we are going to have to make a bigger decision. Until we get some kind of impulsive candlestick, it’s a bit difficult to get overly aggressive in this pair. It seems as if the 1.20 level is going to continue to be a magnet for the price, therefore you need to pay close attention to how the market continues to react to this area. So far, it looks as if it’s ready to grind back and forth but if you look at the chart a little closer, you can recognize that there have been a series of lower highs along the way.</p>
      <p>Underneath, the 1.1925 level has offered a bit of support, and I think that probably extends down to the 1.1850 area where we had seen a little bit of support previously. Breaking down that level will then kick off the major leg lower, perhaps opening up a move down to the 1.15 level. The 1.15 level of course is very likely to continue to be important due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so with that in mind, I think it’s probably a nice target.</p>
      <p>However, if we were to turn around and break above the 1.21 level, then it’s possible that we could go to the 1.24 level above, but that double top I think would be difficult to break above anytime soon and I think it extends all the way to the 1.25 level as well. In other words, there’s a lot of noise out there that is going to continue to be a major issue, so therefore I think you’ve got a situation where you have to look at this more or less from a “fade the rally” type of plan, but you should also perhaps look at this as a short-term market more than anything else at the moment.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Monday but continues to find plenty of buyers near the ¥163 level. The ¥162.50 level is an area that previously had been important as well, so I do think that there’s a lot of support underneath as it shows signs of importance. The 50-Day EMA looks as if it is ready to turn around and break above the 200-Day EMA, kicking off the so-called “golden cross.”</p>
      <p>The ¥165 level above is an area that could be a target as we pierced it previously, only to turn around and fall apart. Having said that, this is all about the Bank of Japan and the fact that there is going to be a continued need by the central bank to keep interest rates lower in that country. In order to do that, they have to buy bonds in order to keep interest rates from spiking in the country. In order to buy bonds, they have to print yen, and have promised to do so in “an unlimited amount.”</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the market has been bullish for quite some time, and therefore I think momentum will continue to be part of the picture here. However, you should also keep in mind that recently when we spiked, we tested the top of a major selloff, and therefore I think it will continue to be a major target, but it is going to be so difficult to break above there that I do not anticipate that it happens anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Short-term pullbacks should continue to be buying opportunities, but you should also keep an eye on the fact that the market is going to be very noisy not only due to the Bank of Japan noise, but the fact that the pair is also very sensitive to risk appetite, which of course is all over the place right now. Because of this, keep in mind that sometimes people will run to the yen when either rates overall drop, or if there is a major fear out there about some type of economic issue. I do believe that eventually we will have to make a bigger decision, but right now it seems like this can be more noise than anything else.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, as it looks like we’re going to continue to see a lot of noise in this pair. The 50-Day EMA currently sits at roughly 1.0675, and the market has tested that level. Ultimately, this is an indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to, but we are also between that and the 200-Day EMA, which typically means that you are going to see a lot of volatility in general. The 1.06 level is an area that a lot of people have paid close attention to recently, but I think that the support extends all the way down to the 1.05 level. The 1.05 level also features the 200-Day EMA, so it all ties together quite nicely.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, the market could drop down to the 1.03 level. The 1.03 level is an area that had been important previously. Ultimately, this is a market that continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, which makes quite a bit of sense considering that the economic situation seems to be all over the place. Ultimately, I think this continues to be a lot of noise more than anything else, but it is worth noting that we had seen a lot of selling pressure from the top. When you look at the recent high, you can see that the selloff began with 2 massive negative candlesticks.</p>
      <p>If the rally did get to that area, I think it would be very difficult to break out above. Quite frankly, I see a significant amount of resistance at multiple levels. The 50-Day EMA of course is a major barrier, and then the 1.07 level is an area where we have seen resistance previously, and of course the 1.08 level. It’s not until we break above there that we can even begin to threaten those massive negative candlesticks where so much had changed in momentum. It is because of this that I think this pair ultimately remains a “fade the rally” type of situation, especially as inflation in the United States remains stubbornly high, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to remain “tighter for longer.”</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to look at the 0.67 level underneath as a potential support level. It has offered support over the last couple of days, so it does make a certain amount of sense that traders continue to come back into this picture. Furthermore, there is a little bit of support underneath there reaching down to the 0.66 level, and therefore I think it’s going to be difficult for this pair to simply fall through the floor. However, it’s probably worth noting that the market has been very choppy in general, therefore I think you probably continue to see a lot of back and forth trading more than anything else.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA has just broken back below the 200-Day EMA, forming the so-called “death cross”, then longer-term sellers may come in and hold short positions. That being said, the 0.68 level above could be resistance, right along with those moving averages. With that being said, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility, and therefore I would not hang on to a position for far too long, due to the fact that there are so many different things out there moving the market around.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Aussie of course is going to be very sensitive to the idea of global growth, or perhaps even the lack of it, and therefore you need to pay close attention to inflation numbers, and of course GDP numbers around the world. The Australian economy is highly levered to the Chinese economy as well, which although just reopening from the pandemic lockdowns, does not necessarily look blazing hot either, although in all fairness the Chinese economy is probably one of the better performers at the moment.</p>
      <p>That being said, if the rest of the world is going to slow down, then the Chinese economy will of course suffer as a result. If we do break down below the support region underneath, it could open up a move down to 0.65 level, which is an area where we had seen a lot of noise previously. Breaking above the moving averages could open up a move to the 0.70 level, but that would take a significant amount of momentum.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has initially rallied during the course of the trading week to break above the 1.20 level, reaching towards 1.21 level before pulling back. We ended up forming a bit of an inverted hammer, so therefore it’s going to be interesting to see how this plays out. The previous week formed the same candlestick, and the week before that was very similar. In other words, every time we rally it looks like the sellers are starting to come back in and push lower.</p>
      <p>It looks as if the area around the 1.19 level is going to continue to be support, so I do think it’s worth watching. Breaking down through that area then opens up a bigger drop from what I can see, which of course is what would coincide with the longer-term trend. We had bounced rather significantly to test the 50% Fibonacci level, and then even formed a bit of a double top in that area. By doing so, this is a market that I believe continues to be very noisy, but in the end will find plenty of sellers to come in and punish it.</p>
      <p>If global risk appetite continues to struggle, I just don’t see how this market takes off to the upside. A breakdown below the 1.1850 level will open up a move down to the 1.15 level, followed by the 1.1250 level. That does not necessarily mean that it will be sudden or have a lot of momentum, but that certainly looks as if it would be the more likely of scenarios right now.</p>

      <p>By Samuel Indyk and Rae Wee</p>
      <p>LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped and China's yuan gained on Wednesday after China's manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace since April 2012, while the euro rose after regional German inflation data signalled price pressures remain high.</p>
      <p>The Australian and New Zealand dollars were also among the beneficiaries of the robust Chinese data, which smashed expectations with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) shooting up to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January.</p>
      <p>China's non-manufacturing activity also grew at a faster pace in February, while the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI reading for last month likewise surpassed market expectations.</p>
      <p>The onshore yuan finished the domestic session at 6.8854 per dollar, the strongest close since Feb. 21, while the offshore yuan jumped 1.3% to 6.8683 per dollar, set for its largest one-day gain since late November.</p>
      <p>"The data confirms expectations that the growth outlook has improved quite significantly in China, so it's positive for risk sentiment," said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.</p>
      <p>"This has put the dollar on the defensive."</p>
      <p>The kiwi surged 1.3% to $0.6263, while the Aussie gained 0.7% to $0.6774, reversing the slide to a two-month low earlier on Wednesday following soft domestic economic data.</p>
      <p>The antipodean currencies are often used as liquid proxies for the yuan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, inflation data from five German states was largely unchanged in the high single digits in February, pointing to no let-up in stubborn price pressures at the national level.</p>
      <p>Preliminary pan-German inflation data is to be published at 1300 GMT, calculated using data from up to 16 German states.</p>
      <p>Figures released on Tuesday showed accelerating inflation in France and Spain, two of the euro zone's biggest economies, pushing up expectations for rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
      <p>The euro was last up 0.9% against the dollar to $1.0672 , on track for its biggest daily gain since Feb. 1.</p>
      <p>"The euro is being well supported by the inflation data," Nordea's Christensen said.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for a more solid euro area inflation reading tomorrow than we had expected going into this week."</p>
      <p>Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.2049, although trimmed earlier gains after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said it was possible the central bank had already come to the end of its rate-rising cycle.</p>
      <p>The pound surged 1% at the start of the week after Britain struck a post-Brexit Northern Ireland trade deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar index fell 0.7% to 104.25.</p>
      <p>The index rose nearly 3% in February, its first monthly gain after a four-month losing streak, as a slew of strong U.S. economic data in recent weeks raised market expectations that the Federal Reserve has further to go in hiking rates.</p>
      <p>Futures pricing currently suggests a peak of around 5.4% in the Fed funds rate by September.</p>
      <p>"We see the Fed going to 5.5%, with a growing risk of 6%," said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank. "The Fed is hiking. Others can't follow or match. The dollar will soar."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.65% against the Japanese yen to 135.36, having spiked close to 5% against the yen in February, its largest monthly gain since last June.</p>

      <p>Alibaba BABA –0.22%  and other Chinese stocks were rallying on Wednesday after data showed that China is quickly leaving behind the lingering impacts of Covid-19 lockdowns, which spurred a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy last year.</p>
      <p>A key measure of Chinese growth marked its fastest expansion in more than a decade in February, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) rising to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January. The February PMI came ahead of expectations and also marked the highest level since April 2021.</p>
      <p>The PMI data is “the strongest sign yet that demand and supply are being fully restored following the lifting of all Covid restrictions in December,” said Raffi Boyadjian, an analyst at broker XM. “The initial tepid pickup in the economy had raised some concerns about how long it would take for the full effects of the reopening to transpire so it’s very encouraging for investors to see that the recovery is well under way.”</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see the Japanese yen pay the price for the Bank of Japan monetary policy. As the 10 year JGB presses 50 basis points, the Bank of Japan has to step in and start printing yen in order to buy bonds. Quite frankly, at this point Japan has no other option but to accept either a weakening currency, or higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>With interest rates around the world climbing overall, it does make a lot of sense the Japanese yen will continue to get hammered as more pressure will be put on the bond market in Tokyo. As the Bank of Japan is the only major central bank in the world offering quantitative easing, the Japanese yen is an easy target for currency traders. With that being the case, not only will the US dollar continue to climb against the Japanese in but is very likely that we will see multiple other currencies do the same. In fact, when you look at the British pound, it is completely ripping the face off of the Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>Just above, the ¥137.50 level is an area that we will need to pay close attention to due to the fact that it was a previous resistance barrier, right along with support. There should be a certain amount of “market memory” in that area, and therefore it’s going to take a significant amount of momentum to break through that area. Short-term pullbacks are very likely, but those will more likely than not end up being buying opportunities.</p>
      <p>The ¥135 level underneath should be support, due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and it is also an area that we have seen quite a bit of noise there in both directions. The 200-Day EMA sits near the ¥134 level, and the 50-Day EMA is getting ready to cross above there in order to form the “golden cross” indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to for a longer-term “buy-and-hold” type of attitude. I have no interest in shorting this pair anytime soon, at least not until the interest rate situation around the world calms down.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has skyrocketed against the Japanese yet again during the trading session on Tuesday as we have seen massive amounts of downward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen across the board. With that being the case, I think this is a market that is now starting to reach a little bit of noise, so perhaps the question now is whether or not we should be switching from the British pound to other currencies against the yen?</p>
      <p>As an example, the New Zealand dollar looks like it’s getting close to breaking out against the Japanese Yen, and while I do believe that the British pound can continue to climb from here, it’s got a lot more noise in the short term to deal with and it has had in the last 48 hours. I certainly wouldn’t short this pair, but I recognize that it has outstretched itself a little bit during the day. With that in mind, I would be cautious, but I would look at pullbacks as a potential buying opportunity.</p>
      <p>Quite frankly, what I would like to see is this market continue to rip higher, because there’s more value to be found in other yen related crosses. For example, the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar all look like they are ready to rip higher against the Japanese yen as well. Simply put, I believe that this chart might be a proxy for what the yen is doing at the moment, because if an overbought condition like this can continue to find buyers, clearly other pairs will have to pay homage to this, and play catch up.</p>

      <p>The Euro has initially pulled back during the trading session on Tuesday but found enough support underneath the 1.06 level to turn things around and show signs of life. The overall market structure of the day seems to be a bit positive, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see the Euro trying to pick up a bit of momentum. The 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.0675 level, and therefore it looks as if it is going to be a bit of resistance.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has initially pulled back during the trading session on Tuesday but found enough support underneath the 1.06 level to turn things around and show signs of life. The overall market structure of the day seems to be a bit positive, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see the Euro trying to pick up a bit of momentum. The 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.0675 level, and therefore it looks as if it is going to be a bit of resistance.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you need to keep an eye on the fact that we are between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, because they attract a lot of attention. Typically, when a currency pair is sitting between these 2 indicators, it means that there are probably going to be traders in both directions pushing quite hard. Typically, when you find the market in this range, there is an explosive move sooner or later as one side or the other finally loses.</p>
      <p>If we break above the 50-Day EMA, it’s possible that the market goes looking to the 1.08 level. On the other hand, if we break down below the 200-Day EMA, is very likely that we would see a huge move lower. On a break down below the 200-Day EMA, I suspect that we will eventually go down to the 1.03 level, and then eventually the parity level which of course would be an area that would attract a lot of attention. Keep an eye on the interest rate situation in the United States, because recently the 2 year and the 10 year have seen moves higher in yield.</p>
      <p>That does typically help the US dollar, but ultimately this is a situation where the markets are in flux, and therefore a lot of noisy behavior does make significant sense. The European Central Bank has reiterated its mission to keep inflation down to 2%, but at the same time the Federal Reserve has reiterated its attitude of staying tight for longer. Because of this, a lot of choppiness is more likely than not going to be the case going forward, so therefore position sizing will be crucial.</p>

      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>

      <p>Ethereum’s fee market is slowly returning to form amid a recent resurgence in NFT trading activity across the network.</p>
      <p>According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the median price for gas powering Ethereum transactions cost roughly 10 to 20 gwei over the past 9 months. This month, that cost had risen to 38 gwei—higher than during key bear market events including FTX’s collapse in November (36 gwei) and Binance’s “bank run” in December (24 gwei).</p>
      <p>“The incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway,” wrote Glassnode in its weekly newsletter on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gas prices fluctuate with network demand, meaning costs rise as more users seek to include their transactions in the next Ethereum block. In this case, rising activity in Ethereum’s NFT market appears to be a primary source of the newfound demand for gas.</p>
      <p>You Can Thank NFTs for Falling Ethereum Gas Prices</p>
      <p>Specifically, gas used by Ethereum NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two months straight, approaching levels last seen during the “NFT boom” from mid-2021 to mid-2022. Much of that rising activity is thanks to Blur, an NFT marketplace launched in October that’s now overtaken OpenSea in terms of trading volume.</p>
      <p>“The recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559,” explained Glassnode.</p>
      <p>Other drivers of NFT activity include all-new projects launched by the industry’s biggest names, including Yuga Labs’ Dookey Dash game and the announcement of Doodles 2 last month.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Ethereum network adoption rate remains low. The number of new addresses being generated is still 40% below what it was 12 months ago. This suggests that the recent revival in NFT activity has been spurred among existing NFT users, rather than new ones.</p>
      <p>Not all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem are seeing rising revenues. In an interview with Decrypt on Friday, Doodle CEO Julian Holguin said that the competition between OpenSea and Blur is constricting cash available to many NFT projects that relied on secondary royalties for revenue.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously.

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously. Because of this, it looks as if the market is going to try to go to the ¥137.50 level, an area that previously had been significant resistance. If we can break above there, then it’s possible that the market could go to the ¥140 level.</p>
      <p>If we pull back from here, the ¥135 level courses a large, round, psychologically significant figure, in an area that previously had been resistance. The fact that we broke above there should now have “market memory” attached to it, suggesting that there should be plenty of value hunters in that general vicinity. The Bank of Japan continues to keep interest rates low and fight 10 year yields from rising above 50 basis points.</p>
      <p>In order to do so they will have to continue to print yen in order to buy their own bonds in Japan. In other words, if rates start to rise again, that will only help the US dollar clobber the Japanese yen. You can also see that the Japanese yen is getting the same treatment almost everywhere, so this is most certainly a Japanese Yen situation more than it is a US dollar situation.</p>
      <p>Looking at this chart, I do think that the trend is starting to change, so I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we try to reach towards the top again as the Bank of Japan has dug in its heels when it comes to yield curve control and has reiterated multiple times that it was going to be stuck in it. At the same time, we have the Federal Reserve making it abundantly clear that it is going to stay “tighter for longer”, meaning that monetary policy in the United States will be much more restrictive than many other economies around the world, thereby making the US dollar attractive.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea. The 1.21 level features the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which of course a lot of people pay close attention to. Because of this, the market is more likely than not going to continue to be very noisy but seems to have a short-term ceiling due to those indicators. Any rally at this point in time more likely than not should be sold into, on the first signs of exhaustion.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we break down below the hammer from last week, it’s very likely that we could go looking to the 1.18 level, an area that really looks supported a while back, and it’s also an area we had launched from to enter the consolidation area that we had been in for a while. If we break down below that level, then it’s like a trapdoor opening, allowing the British pound to fall quite drastically. It does make a certain amount of sense, due to the fact that the US dollar continues to strengthen across the board, so there’s really no reason to think that the British pound will be any different.</p>
      <p>Granted, the Bank of England has recently had to deal with a lot of inflation and therefore monetary policy may remain tight longer than anticipated, but at the same time you can certainly take that same attitude towards the Federal Reserve, and of course the Federal Reserve will get what it wants given enough time.</p>
      <p>It seems traders are just now starting to come to grips with the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to remain “tighter for longer”, as inflation simply is going nowhere in the United States. There’s a high demand for US dollars currently, as interest rates around the world continue to climb, and world governments have to pay back US dollar denominated debt. I like fading rallies at the first signs of exhaustion.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen a bit early during the trading session on Monday to touch the 200-Day EMA. The market bounced from that level to turn around and show signs of life, and now threatens the 1.06 level. It’ll be interesting to see whether or not this happens, due to the fact that there is so much downward pressure on the major currencies that are not the US dollar. The US dollar breaking higher due to the fact that people have struggled with risk appetite, and of course the fact that interest rates on the 2 year yield in America continue to climb, despite the fact that Wall Street believes that the Federal Reserve will eventually come and bail them out.</p>
      <p>The Euro of course has its own issues, not the least of which will be the fact that the economy is running into significant headwinds, but at the same time has a certain amount of inflation. Because of this, the Euro is not ready to go down without a fight but at the end of the day one of the main things that has this market somewhat levitated is the fact that Christine Lagarde has stated repeatedly that an inflation target of 2% is crucial. Nonetheless, if we continue to see a lot of negativity out there when it comes to risk appetite, the Euro will more likely than not start to sell off yet again.</p>
      <p>If we can break down below the 200-Day EMA, then the 1.05 level will be targeted. Anything below there then opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.04 level, and then possibly the 1.0250 level. After that, we have the possibility of going down to the parity level. The parity level of course will attract a lot of headlines, and therefore could be a noisy affair. The alternative scenario would be breaking above the 1.07 level, which would open up a potential move to the 1.08 level. That is where the massive selloff begins from a couple of weeks ago and therefore, I think that as long as we have the same fundamental situation, rallies are more likely than not going to be sold into.</p>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea.

      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level.

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level. By doing so, it suggests that the Aussie is going to continue to see a lot of negativity, and that of course makes a certain amount of sense due to the fact that the global economy seems to be slowing down. Remember, the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to global growth, as the Australian economy is so highly leveraged not only mainland China, but also commodity trading in general. As long as there are concerns of a global slowdown, it does make a certain amount of sense that the Aussie will struggle. Furthermore, the 50-Day EMA is starting to roll over, and is getting ready to break down below the 200-Day EMA, a negative technical indicator known as a “death cross.”</p>
      <p>In the area of 0.67, there is a significant amount of support. Because of this, short-term bounce would not be huge price, but that should more likely than not have a lot of people jumping into the market to short the Aussie again, in order to pick up “cheap US dollars.” If we break down below all the noise just below the 0.67 level, then it’s likely that the market would go looking to the 0.6450 level given enough time.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we were to turn around and breakout above the moving averages above, then the market could go looking to the 0.70 level. The 0.70 level is obviously a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we’ve seen a lot of selling recently. Nonetheless, I do think that this pullback is rather significant, and could get the market really selling off if we get more “risk off behavior” around the world. Regardless of what happens next, we are at an inflection point, and therefore it’s likely that we will see a lot of choppy and noisy trading in this general vicinity.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>A customer hands Indian currency notes to an attendant at a fuel station in Mumbai</p>
      <p>By Nimesh Vora</p>
      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee rose against the dollar on Thursday, helped by a broad recovery in Asian currencies following losses fuelled by worries over rising U.S. yields.</p>
      <p>The rupee was at 82.77 to the U.S. dollar by 10:29 a.m. IST, up from 82.85 in the previous session. Following the higher opening, the local currency has been in a three-paisa range.</p>
      <p>The rupee, it can be safely assumed, will stick to the 82.80 level through the session, a currency dealer at a private sector bank said. Volumes are likely to be on the lower side and speculative interest will be minimal, he said.</p>
      <p>The Korean won, the Asian currency worst impacted by the market's ongoing reassessment of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike path, lead the recovery against the dollar on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was up 0.8% while others rose 0.2% to 0.3%. The dollar index declined slightly.</p>
      <p>The Fed minutes released overnight noted that almost all participants preferred a 25 basis points (bps) hike at the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 Fed meeting, and a few would have liked a 50 bps hike.</p>
      <p>However, the minutes did not have a significant impact on Asian currencies, as they were considered "outdated". Since the Fed's February meeting, there has been a series of data points on inflation and economic activity that surprised the market.</p>
      <p>We’ve already been hearing from some Fed officials that they may be open to up the size of the rate hikes and that a higher terminal rate may be needed, Scotiabank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Risk appetite in Asia was better, weighing on demand for the dollar. Asian shares were mostly higher and futures indicated a positive opening for U.S. equities. Oil prices inched up, recovering from two-week lows.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, as we have seen quite a bit of volatility. Again. The 50-Day EMA has been offering resistance, and of course the 200-Day EMA also is an area where we have seen the light of pressure as well. Now that we have pulled back a bit, it’s likely that we continue to see a lot of noise between here and the 1.20 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that a lot of people will be paying attention to. Furthermore, the 1.20 level is an area where we had seen quite a bit of support previously, so I think everything comes together quite nicely for that being a bit of the support barrier.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 1.20 level, then it’s likely that we go down to the 1.1850 level. The 1.1850 level course was a swing low, and I believe that will be the bottom of the uptrend. In other words, if we break down below there, it’s likely that we drop down to the 1.15 level as it should open up a bit of a vacuum. The shooting star from last week suggests that we have a lot of resistance just above near the 1.2250 level, so if we were to break above there it opens up the possibility of a double top, which is at the 1.24 level, with resistance extending all the way to the 1.25 level. Now that we have formed a double top in that area, one would have to believe that it is going to continue to be a very important level.</p>
      <p>If we were to break above all of that resistance, then it would continue the overall uptrend in the British pound, and as things stand right now it looks like we are essentially close to the bottom of the consolidation area. However, I would point out that the price action over the last several weeks has been somewhat soft, and therefore one would have to believe that all it would take is a kick to the market to knock it over and have a go lower.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as we continue to see a lot all volatility in this pair. We are hanging around the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that a lot of people pay attention to. Because of this, I think it makes quite a bit of sense that we would see choppy behavior. The 0.69 level being in the same general vicinity probably as to the volatility as well, so it is worth pointing that out also.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, we have to ask whether or not this is an area where the Australian dollar is going to see a little bit of support, or if we are going to continue to see negativity. A lot of this will come down to the interest-rate markets, and whether or not traders are starting to focus on tight monetary policy in the United States, or if they are going to focus more on the China reopening situation. After all, the Australian dollar is highly levered to the Chinese economy and of course the demand for Aussie commodities.</p>
      <p>The global growth situation is tenuous at best, but a lot of traders are starting to pin their hopes on China pulling everybody through. If that’s the case, then Australia will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. However, if this market were to break down below the hammer from the Friday session, I suspect at that point we will see further selling pressure on the Aussie dollar, sending it toward the 0.67 level. Regardless, I would anticipate a lot of choppy behavior, but it is worth noting that we have recently seen a significant selloff from the 0.7150 level that has yet to be truly challenged.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA, near the 0.69 level. 0.69 level has been important more than once, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see noise there. As we have broken above that moving average, we also saw a bit of downward pressure, so now it looks as if the market is trying to figure out what it wants to do for a longer-term move.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA, near the 0.69 level. 0.69 level has been important more than once, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see noise there. As we have broken above that moving average, we also saw a bit of downward pressure, so now it looks as if the market is trying to figure out what it wants to do for a longer-term move.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar will be highly levered to commodities, and of course the idea of global growth. With China reopening, there is a bit of hope, but it also is probably worth noting that the global economy itself looks a bit shaky to say the least. The market had recently rallied all the way to the 50% Fibonacci level, only to start selling off quite drastically. Those impulsive candlesticks above should continue to weigh heavy upon the market, especially if we see commodities lose some steam.</p>
      <p>It is probably worth noting that the hammer from the Friday trading session is a candlestick that you should be paying close attention to, because if we were to break down below there, it would be a serious breach of support. Not only would we be breaking down below the hammer, and also the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that will attract a lot of attention by systematic traders. To the upside, I think that the 0.70 level will continue to be a bit of the ceiling, as it is psychologically important, and we have seen a lot of action in that area.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that inflation is still an issue in both Australia and the United States, so the interest rate situation between the 2 currencies may not be as clear as others, but as a general rule of the dollar tends to move in one direction against all currencies. In other words, you can pay attention to multiple currency pairs, and notice the overall direction of the dollar in order to trade this market.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier. That being said, the market also is sitting just above the crucial 200-Day EMA, so the question will be whether or not it can offer support. The 50-Day EMA sits underneath there and is trying to curl back to the upside so I would anticipate quite a bit of noisy behavior.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier. That being said, the market also is sitting just above the crucial 200-Day EMA, so the question will be whether or not it can offer support. The 50-Day EMA sits underneath there and is trying to curl back to the upside so I would anticipate quite a bit of noisy behavior. The market has been repudiated at the ¥135 level, but if he can break above there it has a clear shot to the ¥137.50 level.</p>
      <p>If we can break above there, then the market can continue to go much higher. All things being equal, this is a situation where we see a lot of volatility over the next several days as the Bank of Japan continues to fight higher interest rates, meaning that they will be printing more Japanese yen, thereby driving down the value of that currency. On the other side of the equation, you have the Federal Reserve keeping a very tight monetary policy, so thereby offering a bit of support to the US dollar, despite the fact that may not necessarily be their intention. As long as there is a huge amount of inflation in the United States, that will be a continuous issue.</p>
      <p>It may also be worth noting that the market had recently bounced from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, so that is something that a lot of technical traders will pay close attention to. Beyond that, the ¥127.50 level was where that 50% Fibonacci level showed up, and of course it’s also an area that previously had seen support. With all that, it’s very possible this may remain a “buy on the dips” type of market.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>
      <p>The Euro has seen a lot of action at 1.06, but I suspect it is only a minor support level, perhaps opening up the possibility of a challenge of the 1.05 level, which is much more important in the sense that it was a swing low, and of course the 200-Day EMA sitting in that same area has a huge effect as well. Because of this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we see that area challenged, especially as we have seen a couple of impulsive negative moves over the last couple of weeks. With this, I think the real battle begins in that area.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA on a daily close, then I think you could have a situation where the Euro gets hit really hard. At that point, it would not surprise me at all to see the Euro go down to parity again. On the other hand, if we turn around and take out the shooting star from the Tuesday session, it opens up a move to the 1.10 level above, but that area looks extraordinarily difficult to break higher than, due to the fact that we had seen so much massive selling at what is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and the 50% Fibonacci level from the big move lower.</p>
