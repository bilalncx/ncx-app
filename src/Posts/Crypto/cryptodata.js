    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Bitcoin edged up and continued trading above the US$27,000 threshold on Wednesday morning in Asia, with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies trading mixed. Investors continue to eye U.S. debt ceiling talks.</p>
	    <h3>Bitcoin, Ether rise</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin rose 0.39% over the last 24 hours to US$27,172 at 9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Hong Kong’s securities regulator announced Tuesday that it will allow trading of certain crypto assets from June 1, contributing to the rise.</p>	
	    <p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was, however, down 0.14% over the past seven days.</p>	
	    <p>Ether climbed 0.43% in the past 24 hours to US$1,848, up 0.82% over the past week.</p>
      <p>Dogecoin was down 1% over the last 24 hours to US$0.07267. It also logged a 1% weekly decline.</p>
      <p>Conversely, daily transaction volume on the Dogecoin network reached an all-time high of 1.42 million transactions on Monday. That figure surpasses Ethereum’s 1.11 million, Bitcoin’s 519,716 and Litecoin’s 258,222 transactions, according to data from BitInfoCharts.</p>
      <p>The rise followed the launch on May 9 of a new Dogecoin mechanism. This allows the  issuance of so-called DRC-20 tokens. Some social media commentators have attributed the gains to the hype caused by the release.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BNB added 0.58% over the past 24 hours to US$312. That rise came despite a Reuters report published Tuesday alleging that Binance, the token’s issuer, had failed to properly separate client and company funds.</p>
      <p>“The report is definitely not bullish for Binance or BNB but, ultimately, that’s still one piece of news within a broader market,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.</p>
      <p>“It’s worth noting that BNB as a blockchain recorded a massive amount of transactions, which seems to hint at a lot of enthusiasm, building and utility for the chain, regardless of allegations on Binance’s business.”</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin-based NFT daily sales rise</h3>
      <p><strong>The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</strong></p>
      <p>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.01% at 3,389.10 in the 24 hours to 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index was up 0.12% over the past seven days.</p>
      <p>NFT sales on Ethereum fell 5.34% in the last 24 hours to US$13.49 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Whereas, sales on the Bitcoin blockchain expanded 49.67% to US$4.03 million.</p>
      <p>AssetDash Vanta, a Solana-based NFT collection that started minting on Tuesday, recorded the most sales across the NFT market in the past 24 hours. It recorded a daily sales value of US$1.54 million.</p>
      <p>Bitamigos, a Bitcoin Ordinals collection, is currently second in terms of daily sales value. Its daily sales rose 30.4% over the past 24 hours to US$1.05 million.</p>
      <p>According to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, “the past seven days in NFTs have been all about Bitcoin Ordinals, which now represent three of the top 10 collections.”</p>
      <p>He added that Bored Ape Yacht Club “has been dethroned for now, with two Ordinals projects and Mythos Chain’s DMarket all outselling the NFT community’s favorite apes.”</p>
      <p>Regardless, BAYC still saw the most sales on Ethereum in the last 24 hours. It recorded a daily sales value of US$950,020.</p>
      <h3>U.S. futures rise; New Zealand raises rates</h3>
      <p>Major U.S. stock futures rose as of noon in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.1%. The S&P 500 futures added 0.11%.</p>
      <p>U.S. debt ceiling negotiations continue to drag on. A group of House Republicans raised questions Tuesday regarding the June 1 debt default deadline suggested by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p>
      <p>Yellen has repeatedly stated that the U.S. will fail to pay its debts from that date. The resulting default would lead to devastating consequences for U.S. and global markets. It would also, Yellen warns, erode global trust in U.S. treasuries as a safe haven for investment.</p>
      <p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters on Tuesday that they would like to see “more transparency” on how the Treasury Department arrived at June 1 as the so-called “X-date” for the default.</p>
      <p>“It looks like they’re hedging now and opening the door to move that date back,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand’s central bank hiked interest rates by 25 basis points Wednesday to 5.5%. That is its highest rate in over 14 years. The move is in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, in Japan, business sentiment among domestic manufacturers turned positive for the first time this year, according to a Reuters Tankan poll for May.</p>

      <p>Users should keep an eye on Ethereum’s price and network activity to take advantage of less transaction fees. MATIC’s price action after a long wait turned green.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimizations to Polygon zkEVM are expected to reduce fees by roughly 20%.</li>
        <li>MATIC’s price increased by 2% in the last 24 hours, and metrics looked bullish.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>In its latest tweet, Polygon [MATIC] announced that over the next few weeks, optimizations to zkEVM are expected to reduce fees by roughly 20%. The decline in fees can be a game changer for zkEVM, as it will help attract new users.</p>
    	<h3>How will users benefit?</h3>
      <p>Though the fee reduction will take some time, Polygon revealed a few methods of which users can take advantage even now. As per the tweet, Ethereum’s [ETH] trading price can be tracked in order to make transactions with lower fees.</p>	
    	<p>Because most of the transaction fee is for interactions with L1, users should wait for the times of day when Ethereum is cheapest. Additionally, keeping a close eye on network activity will also help. This is because transaction fees usually go down when network activity increases.</p>	
    	<h3>A look at Polygon zkEVM’s performance </h3>
      <p>After quite a few weeks of sluggish performance, zkEVM’s metrics showed immense gains. For instance, Polygonscan’s data revealed that zkEVM’s daily transactions skyrocketed. In addition to that, zkEVM’s daily gas use also increased considerably, which reflected increased usage of the roll-up.</p>
      <p>Though Polygon zkEVM’s stats looked encouraging, it still had a long way to go before catching up with its competitor, zkSync Era. According to Artemis’ data, zkSync’s daily active addresses were considerably higher than those of zkEVM.</p>
      <p>The same trend remained true for daily transactions, as zkEVM’s figure was substantially lower than zkSync.</p>
      <h3>MATIC has finally responded positively </h3>
      <p>After a long wait, Polygon’s daily chart finally turned green. According to CoinMarketCap, Polygon’s price increased by 2% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.8822, with a market capitalization of over $8.1 billion.</p>
      <p>A reason behind the surge might be MATIC’s declining exchange reserve, which suggests that the token was not under selling pressure. Whales seemed to have increased their holdings as the supply held by top addresses went up.</p>
      <p>MATIC’s supply on exchanges declined while its supply outside of exchanges increased slightly. Moreover, the token also remained in demand in the futures market, as evident from its green Binance funding rate.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin consolidates near key support with a bearish overhead stronghold and neutral futures market.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BTC oscillated between 50-EMA and 100-EMA since 9 May.</li>
        <li>Open interest rates remained unchanged; longs discouraged.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Bitcoin [BTC] continued consolidating near $26.6k support, with volumes remaining low since late March. While the current level could be an accumulation zone, BTC is yet to register a strong rebound, highlighting the tussle between bulls and bears at $26.6k.</p>
    	<p>A recent report highlighted that self-custody for both BTC and ETH has been on the rise, suggesting investors’ huge bets on a likely uptrend move.</p>	
    	<p>But key price resistance levels await, and here is a strong bearish stronghold for BTC bulls to watch out for on the daily chart.</p>	
    	<h3>Will $26.6k and 100-EMA check further drop?</h3>
      <p>The drop from 6 May, left behind an FVG (fair value gap) zone between $27,826 – $28,396 (white). Just below the FVG zone lay the 50-EMA of $27.57k (blue line). Above it lays the $28.5k resistance, a key obstacle back in the second half of March.</p>
      <p>This makes the area a strong bearish stronghold, and bulls must clear it to gain leverage and dent any prevailing bearish sentiment.</p>
      <p>A negative price reaction from the above bearish zone and subsequent breach of the $26.6k support could further weaken BTC’s market structure. The next support levels to the south are the dynamic 100-EMA (yellow) and $25.26k.</p>
      <p>However, a daily session close above the bearish stronghold ($28.5k) could set BTC to rally and retest recent highs of $29k or $31k. Above these resistance levels, the next resistance level lay at $32.4k.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the RSI was below the mid-range, highlighting limited buying pressure. However, the CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) was above the zero mark, indicating substantial capital inflows.</p>
      <h3>BTC’s open interest rates stagnate</h3>
      <p>According to Coinglass data, BTC’s futures open interest rates hovered around $11 billion since the second half of April. This shows a neutral position in the futures market in the same period, meaning prices can go in either direction.</p>
      <p>However, Coinglass’s total liquidation data showed longs were discouraged, with over $5 million worth of positions, out of $9.7 million, wrecked in the past 24 hours as of press time. This reinforces a mild bearish sentiment in the futures market.</p>
      <p>A more nuanced direction could be clear from Monday (22 May). The U.S. debt ceiling negotiation is a major development worth tracking over the coming days as it may affect BTC’s movements.</p>

      <p>The Solana network continued to see improvements and outperformed Tron in various areas. What was driving SOL’s growth?</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Solana outperforms Tron in various sectors, despite having fewer active addresses.</li>
        <li>A booming NFT market and high activity on dApps helped the network’s rise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tron [TRX] has been exceeding expectations as the number of daily active users continued to surge. This caused the protocol to generate large amounts of revenue.</p>
	    <p>However, despite these factors, Solana [SOL] outperformed Tron in various areas.</p>	
      <h3>Tron cannot catch up</h3>
	    <p>Artemis’ data showcased that the daily active addresses on the Tron network were high compared to Solana at press time. However, the latter still outperformed Tron in terms of daily transactions by a huge margin.</p>	
	    <p>This indicated that even though Tron had a large user base, Solana’s users were more engaged with the network. One reason for the same would be the popularity of Solana NFTs. Popular Solana NFT collections, such as Solana Monkey Business and DeGods, have been doing relatively over the last week.</p>
      <p>According to SolanaFloor’s data, the number of owners holding the Solana Monkey Business collection has grown materially over the last few days. Coupled with that, the floor price of this NFT collection also grew significantly in the same period.</p>
      <p>Until press time, no Tron NFT collection could garner the same level of interest as Solana Blue Chip NFT collections.</p>
      <h3>The dApp angle</h3>
      <p>Another factor that has aided Solana in retaining such a loyal and engaged user base is because of the dApps on its protocol. One of its dApps, called Raydium, has seen a massive uptick in the number of users on its protocol. Over the last month, the unique active addresses on the protocol surged by a whopping 163.5%.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, the number of transactions being made on the network also grew.</p>
      <p>Stakers were optimistic about the state of the network as well. Staking Reward’s data indicated that the number of stakers increased by 4.81% in the last month, standing at 621,060 at press time.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Bitcoin fell below US$27,000 on Sunday, dipping further Monday morning in Asia as wider macro developments continue to weigh. With the exception of Tron, which traded higher Monday morning, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell. As the Group of Seven summit in Japan concluded Sunday, investors continue to weigh the implications of U.S. debt ceiling negotiations.</p>
    	<h3>The rise of Tron as Bitcoin, Ether fall</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin fell 1.95% over the last 24 hours to US$26,669 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. That decline contributed to a loss of 1.27% over the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin has so far failed to react positively to lower than expected U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data and to ongoing efforts to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, said Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Singapore-based crypto lender Matrixport, in a note.</p>	
    	<p>“The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading sideways since March, and bar any significant macro news, is unlikely to break US$30,000 anytime soon,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE, said. “Plus, the ongoing macro uncertainty is dampening retail investors’ enthusiasm for ‘YOLOing’ into risk assets right now, while institutional investors are cautiously hedging their bets too.”</p>
      <p>Ether dropped 1.14% in the past 24 hours to US$1,800, down 0.49% over the past week.</p>
      <p>Solana was the biggest loser among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. It recorded a 4.22% decline over the past 24 hours and a 6.92% loss for the week.</p>
      <p>Tron, however, climbed 2.73% over the past 24 hours to US$0.07464, up 7.47% over the past week. Matrixport’s Thielen suggested this may be related to the announcement on May 11 by Tron founder Justin Sun that he would begin trading in memecoins.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tornado Cash rose 23.38% in the past 24 hours to US$4.62. The coin had plummeted to as low as US$3.859 on Sunday before recovering.</p>
      <p>The drop came as the token’s issuer — the Tornado Cash decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) — fell victim to what appeared to be voter fraud over the weekend. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, said on Sunday that it had temporarily halted trading of the token.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Ordinals continue to rise</h3>
      <p><strong>The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</strong></p>
      <p>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index remained flat at 3,399.6 points in the 24 hours to 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index was up 1.77% over the past seven days.</p>
      <p>NFT sales on Ethereum, the most-used blockchain for NFTs, shrank 3.96% in the last 24 hours to US$15.1 million. Sales on the Bitcoin blockchain dropped 18.5% to US$3.54 million, according to Cryptoslam data.</p>
      <p>The Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection recorded the most sales on Ethereum over the past 24 hours. Its daily sales rose 1.1% to US$1.9 million.</p>
      <p>With the growing popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, so-called uncategorized Ordinals – Ordinals that are not part of an established collection – saw a 29% rise to US$960,597 in sales value over the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>US stock futures mixed as talks resume</h3>
      <p>U.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, as investors continued to assess uncertainties surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling talks, alongside the outcomes of the weekend’s G7 summit.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1%, while the S&P 500 edged down 0.036%. The Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.088%.</p>
      <p>Market watchers are expecting U.S. President Joe Biden to meet with House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday to carry on negotiations related to raising the debt ceiling. A deal would help the nation avoid a  potential default on its debt — an outcome that would likely prove devastating for U.S. and global markets.</p>
      <p>During a speech at the G7 summit in the Japanese city of Hiroshima Sunday, Biden unexpectedly drew crypto into the debt ceiling conversation.</p>
      <p>The president would not, he said, agree to “a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly a hundred – excuse me – nearly 1 million Americans.”</p>
      <p>The president’s words offered some indication of the bipartisan nature of ongoing debt discussions between the White House and Congress.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reaffirmed in an NBC interview Sunday that June 1 remains a “hard deadline” to raise the debt limit. Failure to do so would undermine global trust in U.S. securities as a safe haven for investment, Yellen added.</p>
      <p>“It’s not an acceptable situation for us to be unable to pay our bills,” she said.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the People’s Bank of China on Monday morning said that it maintained its key lending rates steady for the ninth straight month, leaving its one-year loan prime rate unchanged at 3.65% and the five-year rate at 4.3%.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Bitcoin and Ether prices fell on Friday morning in Asia. After a bullish run, Litecoin joined most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies in recording losses. XRP was the sole winner. It recorded gains following the launch of its new central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform by its issuer Ripple. U.S. equity futures moved higher after a strong rally in regular trading Thursday. Positive earnings reports, debt ceiling talks both played a role.</p>
      <h3>XRP makes standout gain</h3>
    	<p>Bitcoin fell 1.97% to US$26,852.75 in the 24 hours to 7:45 a.m. Friday in Hong Kong, down 0.67% over the last seven days according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>	
    	<p>The dip back below the $27,000 threshold indicated a return to a bearish trend following gains Thursday. That trend should be short lived, however, said financial analyst Tone Vays during an interview.</p>	
    	<p>“I do believe that we have bottomed. We are now in a halving cycle which tends to have Bitcoin go up with less than one year to the halving event.”</p>
      <p>Halving refers to a pre-programmed reduction of the rate at which new tokens are created, which reduces supply and can drive prices higher.</p>
      <p>“We have had an extended bear market and it’s just time for Bitcoin to rise again,” Vays added.</p>
      <p>Like Bitcoin, Ether fell 0.92% to US$1,804.6. However, it posted gains of 0.29% for the week.</p>
      <p>XRP was the sole gainer among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. It gained 2.68% to US$0.4607 while adding 9.13% in the last seven days.</p>
      <p>Those gains followed an announcement Thursday by Ripple Labs. The payment protocol and exchange network said it is launching a platform for a CBDC as part of Hong Kong’s inaugural e-HKD (electronic Hong Kong dollar) pilot program.</p>
      <p>The Ripple platform will offer a “frictionless end-to-end solution for central banks, governments, and financial institutions to issue their own central bank digital currency,” according to a company press release.</p>
      <p>Ripple will partner with Taiwan-based Fubon Bank on the project.</p>
      <p>The announcement followed further Ripple-related news earlier this week. On Wednesday, a U.S. federal judge denied a motion filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent public access to the so-called Hinman document.</p>
      <p>These internal documents relate to former SEC director William Hinman’s comments that Bitcoin and Ether are not financial securities. The decision is considered a win for Ripple Labs in its ongoing legal dispute with the SEC. The regulator accuses them of providing unregistered securities.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower. Solana led the losers. It fell 3.4% to US$20.36, but was up 0.37% over the past seven days.</p>
      <p>Litecoin lost ground after a bullish week. It was down 3.37% to US$90.77.</p>
      <p>The Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency had seen a surge in recent interest. This was mainly due to congestion and higher transaction fees on the Bitcoin network associated with the current popularity of ordinals. The Litecoin network has also now seen its own surge in ordinal inscriptions.</p>
      <p>On the recent popularity of ordinals on the Bitcoin network in particular, Vays identified a solution to the operational issues it raises.</p>
      <p>“The Bitcoin main chain was not really designed for this kind of purpose,” he said. “Yes, the Bitcoin blockchain can be used for these kinds of projects. I just wish they were done on the Liquid sidechain.”</p>
      <p>The layer 2 solution Liquid offers ways to incorporate ordinals and other initiatives on the Bitcoin blockchain without raising transactions fees, he added.</p>
      <p>The total crypto market capitalization fell 1.44% in the past 24 hours to US$1.12 trillion. Total trading volume lost 6.46% to US$32.07 billion.</p>
      <h3>Space Pepe NFTs soar 28270%</h3>

      <h3>U.S. equities rally; hawkish noises from the Fed</h3>
      <p>U.S. stock futures traded higher as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding momentum to Thursday’s rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.074%, while the S&P 500 futures gained 0.17%. The Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.28% after it gained 1.51% during market trading on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The three Wall Street stock indexes rose after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy said a bill to raise the country’s debt ceiling could be put to a vote next week. The comments followed positive talks with U.S. President Joe Biden,  easing investor concerns that the U.S. could default on its debt.</p>
      <p>That scenario, which would have major repercussions for U.S. and global markets, can be avoided if the White House and congress can agree to raise the debt ceiling.</p>
      <p>Biden and McCarthy have been actively discussing a solution to the ongoing standoff  throughout this week.Biden too has expressed optimism that an agreement can be reached.</p>
      <p>Democratic negotiators informed the president Friday that they are making “steady progress” on debt ceiling talks ahead of his attendance in Japan for the weekend’s Group of Seven summit.</p>
      <p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned earlier this month that the U.S. will start to fail to make its debt payments as early as June 1. Yellen called for fast action on raising the debt ceiling, as she said a debt default would devastate jobs and businesses in the country.</p>
      <p>On the relationship between the crisis and crypto markets, Clara Medalie, Head of Research at crypto market data provider Kaiko, told Forkast via email that there was so far little sign of any impact based on recent price movements.This is “in large part because the event hasn’t yet played out and there remains hope that a deal will be reached before June 1,” she added.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, U.S. investors saw positive Q1 earnings results from major U.S. companies.</p>
      <p>Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, reported 7.6% total revenue growth for the quarter. “We had a strong quarter. Comp sales were strong globally with eCommerce up 26%.  We leveraged expenses, expanded operating margin, and grew profit ahead of sales,” said Walmart President Doug McMillion in the company’s earnings report.</p>
      <p>California-based tech manufacturer Nvidia stocks jumped nearly 5% on Thursday after the company announced that it partnered with another California-based cloud software company ServiceNow to build AI for enterprises.</p>
      <p>On interest rates, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak publicly on Friday. He is expected to signpost the central bank’s latest policy views on inflation and rates.</p>
      <p>Other members of the Fed made hawkish comments Thursday. Fed governor Philip Jefferson said the U.S. should wait to assess the full effect of higher interest rates on inflation so far before deciding to rule out further hikes.</p>
      <p>Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan also said that it is not yet time to pause interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>U.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Fed meets again on June 14 to decide if another rate hike is necessary. Inflation was at 4.9% in April, lower than expected but still ahead of the Fed’s 2% target.</p>
      <p>The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 66.7% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged in June, down from 76.2% a day prior. It predicts a 33.3% chance for another 25 basis-point rate increase.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin and Ether rose during afternoon trading in Asia, along with most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon’s Matic token led the gains.</p>
    	<h3>Crypto market bounces back</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin rose 2.23% to US$27,387  in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The world’s first cryptocurrency fell as low as US$26,601 yesterday, before reclaiming the US$27,000 level. Ether fell 1.13% to US$1,827.</p>	
    	<p>“Bitcoin failed to reclaim the US$28,800 level on the weekly, and then Bitcoin weekly closed below US$27,600, failing to hold it as support… Turn US$27,600 into resistance and this could enable further downside into the low US$20,000s,” said pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital on Twitter. “</p>	
    	<p>Polygon’s Matic saw the biggest daily gain, rising 3.77% to US$0.8813, followed by Cardano’s ADA, up 3.32% to US$0.378.</p>
      <p>XRP token was the only coin in the red, as it fell 0.26% to US$0.4463, after leading the gains in yesterday’s trading session.</p>
      <p>A new security concern was raised after crypto wallet firm Ledger recently announced the launch of Ledger Recover, an optional recovery service for users’ seed phrase.</p>
      <p>The announcement caused widespread community distress about Ledger’s potential backdoor into their devices, putting users’ secret seed phrases at risk. Ledger Chief Technology Officer Charles Guillemet attempted to quell the fire by saying, “There is no backdoor for anyone, neither us, a provider or even a very gifted hacker to access it.”</p>

      <p><strong>The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</strong></p>
      <p>In the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.24% to 3,390.51 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but declined 1.23% during the week.</p>
      <p>Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales decreased for the second consecutive day, dropping 19.17% to US$15.6 million. Bored Ape Yacht Club sales, the largest Ethereum-based NFT collection, fell 63.18% to US$811,464, while its spin-off collection Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales fell 21.22% to US$734,727.</p>
      <h3>Asian and U.S. equities strengthen</h3>
      <p>Most Asian equity markets were up on Thursday, with the Shanghai Composite rising 0.40%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index 0.85% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 1.60%. The Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.12%.</p>
      <p>Investor concerns over China’s post-pandemic economic recovery persisted after data showed that China’s industrial production expanded by 5.6% year-on-year in April, missing market expectations of 10.9%.</p>
      <p>Major U.S. stock futures rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The S&P 500 futures index inched up 0.090%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 0.015%.</p>
      <p>Investor sentiment was lifted by the prospect of the debt ceiling crisis being resolved after President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy indicated on Wednesday that the government would not default on its debt.</p>
      <p>The optimism surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling talks inspired European bourses on Thursday. Germany’s DAX 40 rose 1.41% to 16,176 points, its highest level since Jan. 2022, while the benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.51%.</p>
      <p>Eurozone inflation accelerated to 7.0% in April from 6.9% a month earlier, mainly driven by rising services and energy costs. Core inflation excluding food and fuel prices slowed to 7.3% from 7.5%, according to Eurostat.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Bitcoin prices fell on Wednesday morning in Asia but remained above the US$27,000 line. Ether gained but still posted a weekly drop. XRP led gainers among other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on the back of a favorable ruling for Ripple Labs in its lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). U.S. equity futures gained as U.S. President Joe Biden and Congress reportedly made progress on raising the debt ceiling.</p>
    	<p><strong>Ripple gains after positive ruling</strong></p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin fell 0.87% to US$27,036.75 in the 24 hours to 7:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 2.05% over the last seven days according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>	
    	<p>Ether edged up 0.28% to US$1,825.91, while posting a 1.10% weekly loss.</p>
      <p>Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed on Wednesday morning. XRP led the gains, adding 2.68% to US$0.4399.</p>
      <p>The gain follows positive news for Ripple Labs, a payments firm that depends on XRP technology, as Judge Analisa Torres for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the SEC’s motion to seal the controversial Hinman Speech documents from the public.</p>
      <p>The document refers to a speech given by former SEC official William Hinman on June 14, 2018. In the speech, Hinman stated that the agency did not view Bitcoin or Ethereum as securities. This statement is a major point of focus in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. The regulator accuses Ripple of providing unregistered securities.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Polygon’s Matic led losses among the top 10 non-stablecoins. It registered a loss of 2.21% to US$0.8442, with a 3.56% drop over the past seven days.</p>
      <p>The total crypto market capitalization fell 0.93% in the past 24 hours to US$1.13 trillion. The total trading volume also lost 7% to US$28.74 billion.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitcoin to challenge Ethereum’s NFT supremacy?</strong></p>
      <h3>The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</h3>
      <p>In the non-fungible token market, the Forkast 500 NFT index recorded a loss of 0.13% to 3,378.53 points in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.32% during the week.</p>
      <p>This, said CryptoSlam NFT analyst Yehudah Petscher, can again be attributed to “low volume and high transacting fees from crypto trading.”</p>
      <p>24-hour NFT sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain for NFTs, rose 2.16% to US$18.6 million. Sales on the Bitcoin blockchain took second place on Cryptoslam’s blockchain ranking by gaining 32.11% to US$4.6 million.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin NFTs are just getting started and in the long run, I expect Bitcoin to compete head-to-head with Ethereum’s all-time sales. It may actually exceed them too,” Yehudah said.</p>
      <p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection recorded the highest sales volume in the last 24 hours. It rose 8% to US$2.48 million. All 24 highest individual NFT sales in the past day were Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs according to Cryptoslam. BAYC #466 sold for 98 ETH (US$178,751).</p>
      <p>Milady Maker was second in terms of NFT collection rankings by sales volume on Cryptoslam. It recorded a surge of 207.61% over the past 24 hours to US$1.3 million. The collection took the market by storm last week after Twitter and Tesla chief Elon Musk tweeted an image containing the Milady NFT.</p>
      <p>Traders can expect a slow week ahead in the NFT market as many in the NFT community attend the VeeCon Web3 conference in Indianapolis on May 18-20.</p>
      <p>“Those who believe NFTs can function as access passes, art, and collectibles all in one are in for a treat,” said Cryptoslam’s Yehudah. “I’m expecting markets to be slow while many are off networking, but we also know that degens are going to degen.”</p>
      <p><strong>U.S. stock futures gain after positive debt ceiling talks</strong></p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures traded higher as of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.15%. The S&P 500 futures added 0.19%. The Nasdaq Composite futures also gained 0.24% as investors anticipate a solution to the U.S. debt crisis.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Joe Biden met with leaders of Congress Tuesday to hash out an agreement that would allow a rise in the debt ceiling..</p>
      <p>On May 1, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Congress that the country will start to fail to meet debt payment obligations as early as June 1. That would result in a debt default and wider economic repercussions in the U.S. and globally.</p>
      <p>After the one-hour talk at the White House Tuesday, Biden told reporters that the discussion was productive. House Representative Kevin McCarthy appeared to agree. He said it is possible to reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling by the end of this week.</p>
      <p>Yellen warned again Tuesday that a debt default would result in an income shock that could lead to a recession. This would destroy jobs and businesses in the country, she said. The Treasury leader called for faster action on raising the debt ceiling. She added that the country is already seeing a heavier debt burden as the stalemate drives borrowing costs higher.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each posted losses during regular trading on Tuesday following earnings report releases earlier in the day. Major retailer Home Depot’s revenue dropped 4.2% year on year in the first quarter. Company executives warned investors it may see its first annual sales decline since 2009.</p>
      <p>Investors now await more earnings reports from Tencent Holdings, Cisco Inc., Siemens AG, Target Corp. and more on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to share his views on interest hikes Friday ahead of the Fed’s next interest rate decision on June 14. The rate of between 5 and 5.25% is the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 77.5% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June. However, it also predicts a 22.5% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin, Ether fell in Tuesday afternoon trade in Asia, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Solana was the biggest loser in 24 hours while Litecoin rose the most. European bourses were mixed while U.S. stock futures mostly traded flat. Asian equities were mixed after industrial output in China fell short of expectations, raising doubts over its economic recovery after three years of pandemic-induced disruptions.</p>
	    <p><strong>Top 10 cryptos trade mixed</strong></p>
      <p>Bitcoin fell 0.58% to US$27,261 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, after losing 1.51% on the week, according to CoinMarketCap. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has been experiencing network congestion and upward pressure on transaction costs due to the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals and the increased interest in BRC-20 memecoins like Pepe.</p>	
	    <p>Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, dropped 0.36% to US$1,822 and declined 1.48% on the week.</p>	
	    <p>Solana was the biggest loser of the day, dropping 1.67% to US$21.05, but gained 1.65% in the last seven days. Cardano’s ADA token was the second-biggest loser in 24 hours, falling 1.59% to US$0.3683, but is still up 0.91% on the week.</p>
      <p>Litecoin rose the most, gaining 1.65% to US$88.70, bringing its weekly gains to 12.6%. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin has a finite supply and works on a proof-of-work model. It faced a surge in interest due to the higher transaction fees affecting Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>The cryptocurrency is having its quadrennial block halving event on Aug. 3. Halving refers to a pre-programmed reduction of the rate at which new tokens are created, which reduces supply and can drive prices higher.</p>
      <p>The global crypto market capitalization dropped 0.91% to US$1.13 trillion, while the total crypto market volume rose 1.81% to US$28.36 billion in 24 hours.</p>
      <p><strong>Bored Apes boost Ethereum NFT sales</strong></p>
      <h3>The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</h3>
      <p>In the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index increased 0.82% to 3,377.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, but declined 3.15% during the week.</p>
      <p>24-hour NFT sales on Ethereum increased by 18.74% to US$18 million, boosted by a 390.38% sales surge for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which generated US$2.9 million in sales for the network. 24-hour sales for the Mutant Ape Yacht Club were also up 401.44% to US$1.9 million, while sales for The Captainz collection rose 163.09% to US$1.4 million.</p>
      <p>As for the day’s largest NFT sales, Bored Ape #4980 sold for US$969,903 and DeGod #3251 sold for US$180,799, according to CryptoSlam data.</p>
      <p>“The weather in NFTs has been perfect, with good news from established projects, hot tech, a bit of money in traders’ pockets from trading meme coins, and a well-timed tweet from none other than the current (and soon-to-be former) chief executive officer of Twitter, Elon Musk,” according to Yehudah Petscher, an NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.</p>
      <p><strong>Asian equities mixed after China’s industrial output disappoints</strong></p>
      <p>Asian equity markets were mixed on Tuesday after China’s industrial production expanded by 5.6% year-on-year in April, missing market forecasts of about 10.9%, indicating that the economy is yet to fully recover after the removal of pandemic restrictions.</p>
      <p>Unemployment for 16-to-24-year-olds in the world’s second-biggest economy hit a record high of 20.4% in April, nearly four times higher than unemployment across all age groups, signaling that the health of the economy is not strong enough to absorb new entrants into the labor market.</p>
      <p>“Rising demand from China as its economy reopens could cause oil prices to climb and energy inflation to pick up again as we head into 2024. This would be against a backdrop of OPEC+ production cuts and geo-political tensions,” said David Rees, senior emerging markets economist at Schroders, said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>“Core inflation is still well above target in most major emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and Central Eastern Europe, but it has at least stopped rising, and slower economic growth as higher interest rates bite ought to gradually bring down core inflation,” Rees added.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.6%, the Shenzhen Component Index slipped 0.71% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.04%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 strengthened 0.73% on Tuesday to close at an 18-month high, extending a climb towards its highest since the early 1990s, aided by strong corporate earnings and signs of easing inflationary pressure.</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures were mostly trading flat as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The S&P 500 futures index inched down 0.078%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures inched up 0.0093% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased 0.084%.</p>
      <p>Investors were optimistic about Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee signaling their intent to pause interest rate hikes in the world’s largest economy.</p>
      <p>Goolsbee hopes to await the effects of increases aimed at lowering inflation from multi-decade highs. While Bostic also favors a pause on rate hikes for now, he suggested that the next move is likely to raise rates instead of lowering it, in light of persistent price pressures.</p>
      <p>Investors are now looking ahead at President Joe Biden’s negotiations with congressional leaders on raising the U.S. debt ceiling to keep the government solvent. The negotiations are set to resume on Tuesday. The U.S. treasury reiterated on Monday that it expects to default by June 1, without a debt limit increase.</p>
      <p>Pressured by the prospect of a government default, the U.S. dollar fell 0.17% to 102.2 points on Tuesday. The euro gained ground, increasing 0.22% to US$1.08, remaining close to its 12-month high of US$1.10.</p>
      <p>European bourses were mixed, despite data showing that Europe’s economy grew by a modest 0.1% in the first quarter while employment grew 0.4%, according to Eurostat. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.11% while Germany’s DAX 40 inched up 0.095%.</p>
      <p>Markets were also weighed down by the release of the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment amid already unfavorable economic sentiment over the next six months. ZEW’s measure of investor morale fell to -10.7 in May, the first negative since December 2022. The indicator declined from 4.1 in April and fell more than analyst expectations that predicted a decline to -5.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin and Ether fell during Friday afternoon trading in Asia, along with most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, apart from the XRP token. Most Asian equities declined despite data reflecting an economic recovery in Hong Kong U.S. stock futures strengthened for a second consecutive session, as negotiations over raising the debt ceiling are set to resume in the world’s largest economy.</p>
    	<p><strong>Crypto market declines as Bitcoin falls below US$27,000</strong></p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin dropped 4.14% to US$26,293 in 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The daily decline by the world’s first cryptocurrency was the biggest daily drop in the top 10 coins by market cap.</p>	
    	<p>“Bitcoin has to hold [US$26,111] for continued bullish momentum,” Nilesh Verma, crypto market analyst and founder of Crypto Granth consultancy, told Forkast. “We believe that we will see strong buying near US$25,000-26,000,” he added.</p>

      <p>NFT trading is slowing due to the recent memecoin hype, with very few new users entering the space, according to Eric Dettman, NFT advisor at CryptoSlam. NFT buyers on the Ethereum blockchain totaled 45,298 in the past seven days, a drop of 72.97%.</p>
      <p>24-hour NFT sales on Ethereum dropped 51.7% to US$16.3 million, after yesterday’s strong session. Sales for the Bored Ape Yacht Club, the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, fell 60.02% to US$2.4 million, while sales for the Mutant Ape Yacht Club also decreased 61.78% to US$1.4 million. 24-hour sales for Milady Maker dropped 88.83% to US$864,000, after generating over US$9.6 million of sales for the network on Thursday.</p>
      <p>As for the day’s most notable NFT transactions, Bored Ape #6805 sold for US$349,967 3 hours ago and CryptoPunk #1232 sold for US$148,324 8 hours ago, according to CryptoSlam data.</p>
      <p><strong>Most Asian equities fall; U.S. futures rise for second consecutive session</strong></p>
      <p>Asian equities declined on Friday, tracking losses on Wall Street, except for Japan’s Nikkei 225 that rose 0.9%. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.12%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.59% and the Shenzhen Component Index declined 1.23%</p>
      <p>Investors reacted negatively to government data showing that Hong Kong’s economy grew 2.7% year-on-year in the first quarter, recovering from a 4.1% contraction in the previous quarter, accounting for a lower Hang Seng Index on the day. The expansion was Hong Kong’s first economic upturn since the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly supported by a recovery in the tourism sector and domestic demand</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures strengthened for a second consecutive trading session, after consumer prices eased more than expected in April and bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Overnight, U.S. jobless claims increased, adding to market concern of a potential recession, with the job market as one of the pillars that prop up the economy.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 futures index rose 0.39%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.22% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 0.41%.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar index inched up 0.06% to 102.1 points, set for its first weekly gain in three weeks. The euro inched down 0.07% to US$1.09, the lowest value in three weeks.</p>
      <p>President Joe Biden is set to continue negotiations to raise the debt ceiling later today, to keep the U.S. government solvent. Wednesday’s talks over the matter ended with no deal in sight.</p>
      <p>The Bank of England raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, marking its 12th consecutive hike, increasing borrowing costs to 4.5% – the highest since October 2008.</p>
      <p>London’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose 0.47% on Friday, after three consecutive sessions of losses, after data showed that the UK’s economy expanded 0.1% in the first quarter of the year, in line with market expectations.</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) -Binance said on Friday it was withdrawing from Canada, weeks after the country issued a series of new guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges including investor limits and mandatory registrations.</p>
    	<p>Canada has tightened regulations for crypto asset trading platforms in recent months, with the introduction of a pre-registration process. The companies that do not adhere to the rules will face potential enforcement action, according to the website of the Ontario Securities Commission.</p>	
    	<p>"Unfortunately, (the) new guidance related to stablecoins and investor limits provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada market no longer tenable for Binance at this time," crypto exchange Binance said in a tweet.</p>	
    	<p>Binance said it does not agree with the latest guidance and hopes to engage with the Canadian regulators to create a comprehensive framework for crypto operations in the country.</p>
      <p>"We are confident that we will someday return to the market when Canadian users once again have the freedom to access a broader suite of digital assets," said the crypto exchange, founded by Canadian national Changpeng Zhao.</p>
      <p>The digital assets industry has been in the crosshairs of regulators around the world, especially since the collapse of Binance-rival FTX in November, which triggered a market rout in the prices of the biggest digital coins.</p>
      <p>Following the onset of the crypto winter of 2022, which wiped out more than a trillion dollars from the industry's market value, lawmakers and securities regulators demanded tighter guidelines for disclosures on how the crypto companies operate and hold customer funds.</p>
      <p>In March, Binance and its CEO Zhao were sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission for operating what the regulator alleged was an "illegal" exchange and a "sham" compliance program.</p>

    	<h3>In this atricle:</h3>
    	<p>Bitcoin (BTC) continues to lose ground in the wake of CoinDesk's Bitcoin Trend Indicator shedding the bullish bias for the first time in three weeks.</p>
    	<p>The top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $26,160 before press time, reaching the lowest since March 17, according to CoinDesk data. Prices have declined by over 12% since May 6, decoupling from the uptick in traditional risk assets like Nasdaq.</p>	
    	<p>The BTI indicator, which measures the directional momentum and strength in bitcoin's price, flipped from bullish to neutral on Thursday. The indicator consistently signaled an uptrend since Jan. 13, barring the brief red flash (downtrend signal) in mid-March and the neutral reading on April 24.</p>	
    	<p>According to Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at Astronaut Capital, low liquidity seems to have helped few sellers drive prices lower.</p>
      <p>"There seems to be 'paper thin' liquidity right now, even across majors such as BTC. While we can't point at a direct reason for the weakness, any medium to large offers are driving the market down," Dibb said.</p>
      <p>Liquidity or market depth has recently worsened on major exchanges, including Binance, making it difficult for traders to execute large orders without influencing prices.</p>
      <p>According to Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven crypto trading firm TDX Strategies, the downside move may gather pace if traditional risk assets turn lower.</p>
      <p>"We could get an acceleration on the downside IF U.S. equities also start to roll over," Lo told CoinDesk. "$25,200 is key support for BTC followed by $23,100 on potential downside acceleration."</p>
      <p>Lo added that the bearish bias would be invalidated if prices rise above $28,500.</p>
      <p>As analysts warned last week, bitcoin's drop to two-month lows has confirmed a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern on technical charts. The breakdown has opened doors for a deeper slide toward support around $25,000.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>Bitcoin edged higher on Wednesday morning in Asia to hold above the US$27,500 mark as the hype for Bitcoin-based memecoins that had clogged the network seemed to cool off. Ether also gained, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Litecoin led the winners as high transaction fees on Bitcoin drove users to alternatives, with the Litecoin network logging a record-high in daily transactions. Polygon’s Matic led the losers. U.S. equity futures traded flat on concern about U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and ahead of inflation numbers on Wednesday.</p>
    	<p><strong>Bitcoin, Ether stabilize after dip</strong></p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin edged up 0.60% to US$27,754 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, but was still holding a weekly loss of 2.64%.</p>	
    	<p>“Bitcoin prices have been impacted by significant congestion and skyrocketing transaction fees,” Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at London-based financial institute CPT Markets, said in an email. “Such network issues and infrastructure disruptions could limit institutional investors’ confidence in the asset.”</p>
      <p>The congestion on the Bitcoin network is attributed to the hype around BRC-20, a token standard introduced on March 9 that enables the minting of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The total market cap of BRC-20 tokens has dropped from around US$961 million on Monday to US$688 million at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to blockchain data tracker BRC-20.io.</p>
      <p>Ether gained 0.49% to US$1,852. It’s down 0.44% for the week.</p>
      <p>Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Polygon’s Matic leading the losers, falling 2.40% to US$0.8782 and posting a weekly loss of 9.47%.</p>
      <p>Litecoin led the winners, gaining 3.45% to US$80.33. However, it’s down 8.56% for the week. The Litecoin blockchain has logged record-high daily transactions this week as high transaction fees on the Bitcoin network drove users to other platforms. Transactions on the Litecoin blockchain totaled over 525,000 on Monday, more than five times higher than the start of the month, according to blockchain data platform BitInfoCharts.</p>
      <p>The total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.46% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion. The total trading volume dropped 29.34% to US$32.02 billion.</p>
      <h3>NFTs fall</h3>
      <p><strong>The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</strong></p>
      <p>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.91% to 3,462.33 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 6.64% for the week.</p>
      <p>Azuki, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, saw the largest sales across the market in the past 24 hours, surging 388.12% to US$2.47 million to surpass US$1.51 million for DMarket and US$880,000 for Bored Ape Yacht Club, according to data by CryptoSlam.</p>
      <p>Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, said Tuesday its NFT marketplace would soon add support for Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions – the Bitcoin blockchain’s iteration of NFTs. The platform currently supports NFTs on BNB Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.</p>
      <p>Equities futures flat</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures were flat to slightly higher as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.06%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.10%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.08%.</p>
      <p>The three U.S. indexes closed lower on Tuesday amid concerns about the U.S. government’s potential default in June. U.S. President Joe Biden met with congressional Republicans on Tuesday to discuss raising the government’s debt ceiling, but made little progress, according to Bloomberg on Wednesday. Another meeting is set for Friday.</p>
      <p>The U.S. April consumer price index report on Wednesday will give a peek into the pace of inflation and provide insights into the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates after a year-long round of hikes. Economists predict the inflation rate rose 5% in April on year, or the same pace as March and still far from the Fed’s goal of 2%, according to a Wednesday Bloomberg report.</p>
      <p>New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Tuesday it was still premature to say whether the Fed had done with its rate hikes, adding there is “a need to keep a restrictive stance of policy in place for quite some time to make sure” the inflation rate falls to 2%, according to Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Fed is set to meet on June 14 to decide on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 78.8% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, while it gives a 21.2% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 14.3% on Tuesday.</p>

    	<p>Ether (ETH) holders are rushing to stake their tokens with network validators, pushing deposit activity to the highest level since the Shapella upgrade earlier this year.</p>
	    <p>More than 200,000 ether have been deposited to the network since the start of the week, data from the on-chain analytics tool Nansen show, marking the first time deposits have outpaced withdrawals since Shapella went live last month. The additions bring the number of ether locked for staking purposes to over 19 million tokens – about 15% of the total circulating supply.</p>	
	    <p>The influx comes as traders flock to meme coins such as pepecoin (PEPE), which has strained the Ethereum network and sent transaction fees to a 12-month high.</p>	
	    <p>Over 6 million staked ethers are held on Lido Finance, a protocol that issues depositors with alternative tokens representing the amount they've locked up. Those alternatives can then be used as liquidity in the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Shappella – a portmanteau of Shanghai and Capella, two major Ethereum network upgrades that occurred simultaneously on April 12 – gave investors the ability to withdraw their staked ether at will for the first time.</p>
      <p>In a proof-of-stake blockchain such as Ethereum, users stake, or lock, cryptocurrency – ether in this case – to help secure and confirm new data blocks. These stakers receive network rewards in the form of tokens, creating a form of passive investing strategy.</p>
      <p>Platforms such as Lido pay out 6.6% in annualized yield rewards to stakers. More complex strategies involving staked ether and other tokens can yield up to 21%, data from Defillama shows.</p>

    	<p>Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace said Tuesday it’s planning to add support for Ordinals, or Bitcoin NFTs later in May, though an exact date was not announced.</p>
    	<p>Binance NFT, which already supports NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon and its native BNB Chain, plans to expand its offerings by allowing traders to purchase Ordinals on the Bitcoin network. Collectors can soon buy and sell inscriptions, or NFTs created on the Bitcoin network, expanding the reach of the nascent Ordinals ecosystem.</p>	
    	<p>Additionally, in order to help onboard users to Bitcoin NFTs, Binance will allow traders to purchase Bitcoin-based NFTs with their Binance accounts, simplifying the process for users. Instead of having to set up a taproot-compatible Bitcoin wallet to purchase Ordinals, as collectors wanting to mint NFT giant Yuga Labs’ TwelveFold Ordinals needed to do, Binance aims to make the process simple and secure for new buyers to enter the growing market.</p>	
    	<p>Binance Head of Product Mayur Kamat said in a press release that he sees Bitcoin as “the broadest choice” for NFT collectors as well as a growing market for the exchange to tap into.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin is the OG of crypto,” said Kamat. “We believe things are just getting started here and can’t wait to see what the future holds in this space.”</p>
      <p>However, Binance’s relationship with Bitcoin hasn’t all been positive in recent days. On Sunday, the exchange paused Bitcoin withdrawals twice, citing network congestion as the catalyst.</p>
      <p>As Ordinals reached 3 million inscriptions last week, the demand for marketplaces to embrace Bitcoin NFTs is only intensifying. In March, NFT marketplace Magic Eden added support for Ordinals, integrating Bitcoin wallets Hiro and Xverse to do so. In April, the marketplace rolled out a creator launchpad to help artists mint their inscriptions before listing on the secondary marketplace.</p>

    	<p>Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice in 24 hours over the weekend. The exchange cited "network congestion" as the reason for the suspension, which lasted for about an hour on Sunday. The move came after Binance faced a similar issue on Saturday, when it paused Bitcoin withdrawals for about 20 minutes due to a "minor technical issue". The exchange assured its users that their funds were safe and that it was working to resolve the problem as soon as possible.</p>
    	<p>Bitcoin withdrawals are a crucial function for cryptocurrency exchanges, as they allow users to move their coins from the platform to their own wallets or other services. Any disruption or delay in this process can cause frustration and suspicion among customers, especially in a volatile market.</p>	
    	<p>Binance said they have increased the fees on withdrawals and are working to integrate the Lightning Network, a layer-two payments protocol for Bitcoin.</p>

    	<p>MATIC’s bullish order block at key support level continues to slow down bearish momentum.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MATIC’s market structure on the daily timeframe remained bearish.</li>
        <li>Indecision between buyers and sellers kept prices stuck in a range. </li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Polygon [MATIC] began the year as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. It posted a 108.9% gain between 1 January and 18 February. However, a huge correction flipped its market structure from bullish to bearish.</p>	
    	<p>Prices traded sideways between mid-March to mid-April before BTC’s correction sent MATIC on another downward spiral.</p>	
    	<p><strong>MATIC stuck in a tight spot</strong></p>
      <p>The indecision between buyers and sellers has confined MATIC to a tight range for the past three weeks. It has traded between the $0.950 support level and $1.028 resistance level on the four-hour timeframe.</p>
      <p>The bullish order block’s confluence with the $0.950 support level just below it has served as a rallying point for bulls. Price has bounced off the support level four times in quick succession to stem the selling pressure.</p>
      <p>However, the RSI and CMF both pointed to weakening buying pressure at that level. The RSI has stayed under neutral 50 over a two-day period while the CMF was at -0.15 as of press time.</p>
      <p>A four-hour candle close below the $0.950 support level could lead to a bearish breakout for MATIC with $0.835 as the target for bears.</p>
      <p><strong>Could a bullish reversal be on the horizon?</strong></p>
      <p>A look at key on-chain metrics suggested MATIC buyers might not be giving up yet. Data from Santiment showed a decline in active addresses and an increase in the total number of holders. This showed that an accumulation could be ongoing for Polygon’s native currency.</p>
      <p>Funding rates have been consistently positive over the past 14 days, which showed that demand existed for MATIC, even at press time. The spot CVD also experienced an uptick.</p>
      <p>A bullish reversal will be hugely dependent on the confluence of the bullish order block and support level at $0.950 holding out once again.</p>

	    <p>The crypto market was awash with fear and uncertainty as liquidations reached over $50 million, leaving investors reeling and short positions crushed under losses.</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>The crypto market witnesses a $50 million liquidation event, with Ethereum and memecoins at the forefront.</li>
        <li>Short positions take a hit as investors face substantial liquidations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>7 May witnessed a dramatic event in the crypto market as over $50 million worth of investments got liquidated. Ethereum [ETH] took the lead in this wave of liquidation. However, hot on its heels was a memecoin that had been capturing the attention of enthusiasts worldwide.</p>	
    	<p><strong>Crypto market witness over $50 million in liquidations</strong></p>	
    	<p>According to the latest data from Coinglass, the crypto market experienced an extraordinary 24-hour liquidation surpassing the $50 million mark. At the time of writing, the liquidation amount stood at approximately $52 million, having previously surged past $100 million. Ethereum took the lead in liquidation volume, with over $2 million currently liquidated.</p>
      <p>Adding to the liquidation statistics was memecoin Pepe [PEPE], which ranked second, with a staggering liquidation of over 640 billion PEPE. The tokens were equivalent to a value exceeding $1 million. Other affected cryptocurrencies included king coin Bitcoin [BTC], with over 1 million coins.</p>
      <p><strong>Short positions see more liquidations</strong></p>
      <p>Coinglass’ data further revealed that the liquidations primarily targeted short positions in the market. The data indicated that a substantial portion of investors holding short positions faced liquidation. Also, over 70% of liquidations were witnessed across various major exchanges.</p>
      <p>In certain instances, the liquidation rate reached a staggering 100%, leaving no room for short investors to escape unscathed.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, a detailed breakdown of Bitcoin’s liquidation data demonstrated that shorts accounted for over $16 million. Whereas, long positions experienced liquidations totaling over $12 million.</p>
      <p>Considering Bitcoin’s significant share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, these liquidations bear significant implications for affected investors.</p>
      <p><strong>Crypto market maintains $1 trillion mark</strong></p>
      <p>According to an evaluation of the crypto market’s capitalization on CoinMarketCap, it remained at an impressive value exceeding $1 trillion. Also, Bitcoin maintained its dominance at nearly 50%.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the 24-hour trading volume had surpassed $42 billion. Although a widespread chain reaction of liquidations had not unfolded at that point, the prevailing market conditions warranted a cautious approach from investors.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the rise in exchange withdrawals and notable instances of high-value cash-outs underscored the need for market participants to remain vigilant and adequately prepared for unforeseen fluctuations in market sentiment.</p>

    	<p>Tron’s development activity metric recently showed signs that activity is regaining after the previous downside seen since the last week of April. A stronger recovery backed by memecoin-related hype might be enough to also inject some investor excitement into TRX.</p> 
    	<ul>
        <li>Tron founder outlines a plan to take advantage of prevailing memecoin excitement.</li>
        <li>TRX on a retracement path after a bullish performance in the first week of May.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Tron [TRX] network is looking to capitalize on the recent memecoin hype. There was a lot of excitement in the memecoin segment as the rest of the market continued to slow down.</p>	
    	<p>Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, recently made an announcement revealing his company’s strategy to secure a bigger piece of the memecoin pie. The statement revealed that the network aims to incentivize the creation of more memecoins by offering funding to developers.</p>	
    	<p>Tron will also collaborate with major exchanges, including Poloniex and Huobi. Tron’s goal is to facilitate easy and early access to memecoins. Timely development addresses one of the most common recent problems, which is the availability of multiple scam memecoins alongside legitimate ones. Tron will be addressing such challenges with this memecoin program.</p>
      <p><strong>Can TRX benefit from budding memecoin optimism?</strong></p>
      <p>TRX is among the few cryptocurrencies that pulled off a significant upside since the start of May. However, it experienced some sell pressure over the weekend after briefly crossing into overbought territory.</p>
      <p>TRX exchanged hands at $0.069 after a bit of a weekend slide, although it had fallen by less than 3%. A sizable market reaction may curtain the potential downside and perhaps allow the bulls to regain control. But some of Tron’s metrics point to a different potential outcome.</p>
      <p>A look at TRX’s market cap confirmed recent significant outflows. Meanwhile, on-chain volume continued to drop, as has been the case since the start of May.</p>
      <p>The lack of a volume spike in the last few hours confirms the market’s response or lack there of, to Tron’s memecoin pursuits. In addition, investor sentiment remains low according to the weighted sentiment.</p>
      <p>Despite the above findings, there is one noteworthy upside. Tron’s development activity metric showed signs that activity was rebounding after the previous downside seen since the last week of April. A stronger recovery backed by memecoin-related hype might be enough to also inject some investor excitement into TRX.</p>
      <p>The memecoin hype may only come into play if Tron’s plan attracts more participation from developers. As such, the subsequent impact might only be evident in the mid to long term.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin Ordinals reaches unprecedented heights, breaking fee records and surging in popularity, while BTC price cautiously recovers with modest gains, charting its course.</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Bitcoin Ordinals breaks records with daily fees paid to miners reaching over $1.4 million.</li>
        <li>BTC price shows a different trajectory with modest gains of less than 1%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Bitcoin [BTC] phenomenon continued to surge at press time, breaking new ground with each passing moment. A similar surge in popularity has propelled Bitcoin Ordinals to unprecedented heights.</p>	
    	<p>Ordinals’ latest data showcased a remarkable milestone for Bitcoin’s Non-Fungible Tokens [NFTs]. Riding this exhilarating wave, miners are reaping the rewards of their labor on the network, embracing the winds of change with open arms.</p>	
    	<p><strong>Bitcoin Ordinals breaks records</strong></p>
      <p>Leonidas’ post on 6 May delivered astonishing news regarding the soaring heights reached by Ordinals. The daily fees paid to miners broke all previous records, surpassing even the grand sum of $1.4 million.</p>
      <p>Per Dune Analytics, this remarkable achievement effortlessly outshined the last all-time high of over $800,000. The surge in value was not limited to fees alone, as the volume of Ordinals‘ trade surged to an unprecedented pinnacle, surpassing an astounding $9.2 million.</p>
      <p>The number of daily active users also experienced a surge, surpassing the remarkable milestone of 6,000. This exponential fee growth had a ripple effect on Bitcoin’s overall fee accumulation. Crypto fees revealed a staggering daily fee of over $5 million, indicating a promising upward trend in the daily fee chart. This surge in fees hinted at the potential for further growth.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitcoin miners feast as fees spike</strong></p>
      <p>The impact of Ordinals and BRC-20 transactions has left a significant imprint on miners’ fees, sparking a remarkable surge recently. As of this writing, the miner fees have skyrocketed by a staggering 11%, catapulting them to a level reminiscent of over two years ago.</p>
      <p>Before this impressive surge, the fees had experienced a decline around June 2021, reaching a peak of approximately 3%.</p>
      <p>The surge in Ordinals transactions, coupled with the heightened demand for mining blocks, naturally increased miners’ activities and subsequent fees. However, the sustainability of this remarkable spike remains uncertain, leaving room for speculation and anticipation.</p>
      <p><strong>BTC price sees a different trajectory</strong></p>
      <p>While the Ordinals brought excitement to miners, the price of BTC has yet to mirror this enthusiasm. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was recovering from a recent decline in value experienced during the previous trading period. It was traded at approximately 28,900, showcasing a modest gain of less than 1%.</p>
      <p>Despite the optimism surrounding Ordinals and its impact on miners, the price of Bitcoin appeared to be navigating a different trajectory, displaying a more cautious and subdued movement.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p><strong>Welcome to the weekend.</strong> Phil Rosen here, writing to you from Manhattan.</p>
    	<p>I'm somewhat of a skeptic when it comes to digital assets, but so far this year bitcoin's been the top performing asset by a landslide — it's up more than 73%.</p>	
    	<p>I caught up with a blockchain executive to get the scoop on why that rally could see more upside as the economy slows down.</p>	
    	<p>Bob Ras is the cofounder of blockchain firm Sologenic. This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
      <p><strong>Phil Rosen: What's the impact of the banking crisis and the Fed on the outlook for bitcoin?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Bob Ras:</strong>As big banks have been collapsing, it seems clearer by the day that these investors see bitcoin as a hedge because of its decentralized censorship resistance and lack of counterparty risk.</p>
      <p>There are growing expectations that the Fed will loosen monetary policy and effectively inject a lot more liquidity into the market to shore up the financial system. And bitcoin is front-running this scenario, pointing to a future that is effectively a return to relatively low rates.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't be surprised if $40,000 could be reached by the end of this year.</p>
      <p><strong>What's been fueling bitcoin's sharp rally to start 2023 so far?</strong></p>
      <p>A big reason why bitcoin has performed so well was that it was just really oversold during the collapse of FTX.</p>
      <p>Plus, there's on-chain evidence that more and more people and institutions have been accumulating bitcoin during the lows, which essentially translated into a supply shock.</p>
      <p>With so few sellers left, any uptick in demand has an outsize impact on price.</p>
      <p><strong>What's a downside risk ahead that could weigh on bitcoin prices?</strong></p>
      <p>The biggest risk would be a sharp credit crisis that causes a rapid contraction.</p>
      <p>In such a scenario, all assets would have a correlation of one with each other, including bitcoin and even gold. I'm not sure such a scenario would happen, but it's possible and would unleash a tremendous amount of volatility not only for bitcoin but all markets.</p>
      <h3>And here are the top stories from markets this week: </h3>
      <p><strong>1. A stock portfolio created by ChatGPT is outperforming the top investment funds across the UK.</strong> The theoretical portfolio created by Finder.com includes 38 stocks, and it's generated 4.9% returns over eight weeks.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Top economist Mohamed El-Erian warned of potential collateral damage from the First Republic-JPMorgan deal.</strong> The Wall Street giant agreed on Monday to acquire most of the battered firm's assets — but El-Erian sees four critical, unintended consequences that could materialize as a result.</p>
      <p><strong>3. UBS analysts just named 40 cheap stocks that they expect to outperform in a recession.</strong> Weaker economic growth will help defensives dominate over cyclicals, and this collection of relatively inexpensive picks look poised to fare well in a weaker landscape.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Russian gold is now flooding the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Turkey.</strong> Sellers have had to find new buyers for the key metal now in light of wartime sanctions from the West. Big gold buyers like HSBC and JPMorgan have shunned business with Moscow — leaving billions of dollars worth of gold in need of new landing spots.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Nobel economist Paul Krugman doesn't think dollar dominance is worth much to the US.</strong> The notion is overrated, in his view, and he thinks it's best just to ignore all the dollar doomers out there: "Or better yet, consider what their hyping of a nonissue says about their own judgment."</p>
      <p><strong>6. Apple attracted $1 billion to its new high-yield savings account in four days.</strong> The iPhone marker debuted the account last month, with a yield of 4.15%. And the number of people that have signed up so far represents just a fraction of total iPhone users.</p>
      <p><strong>7. The nation's leading market-watchers and policy pros are concerned about a credit crunch and a spiraling commercial real estate sector.</strong> It's an uncertain time for the US economy, with growth slowing down and inflation staying stubbornly high. Here's what three experts expect to come down the pipeline.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Yankees legend A-Rod learned two key rules about investing from Warren Buffett.</strong> Alex Rodriguez told Bloomberg he became business partners with the billionaire after the Berkshire chief insured his multi-million dollar playing contract. The pair made a habit of meeting up in Omaha — and Rodriguez still carries the lessons with him today.</p>
      <p><strong>9. These 20 defensive stocks could help your portfolio weather a downturn.</strong> Morgan Stanley's top strategists cautioned that a strong earnings season could convey a false sense of security. But they see this batch of names as one potential corner of opportunity.</p>
      <p><strong>10. BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder manages $2.7 trillion.</strong> He told us how he's positioning cash for a fading economy and the portfolio strategy he's employing to avoid losses right now.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin rose while Ether fell in Thursday afternoon trade in Asia, with declines across most of the other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Solana’s SOL token was the biggest loser of the day. Asian equities were mixed, while U.S. stock futures strengthened in anticipation of April’s nonfarm payroll report. The U.S. dollar index fell, as woes at regional U.S. lenders PacWest and Western Alliance fueled market concerns of a banking crisis.</p>
    	<p><strong>Crypto</strong></p>	
    	<p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, rose 0.11% to US$29,124 in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Ether fell 0.19% to US$1,899.</p>	
    	<p>“Bitcoin needs to close above US$32,000 to confirm an upward trend,” Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products, wrote in an email to Forkast.</p>
      <p>Solana’s SOL token fell 0.98% to US$21.93 as the day’s biggest loser, followed by Dogecoin that slipped 0.77% to US$0.0787.</p>
      <p>The global crypto market capitalization decreased by 0.07% to US$1.19 trillion, while total crypto market volume fell 20.02% to US$34.25 billion. </p>
      <p><strong>NFT</strong></p>
      <p>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.4% to 3,645.72 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and declined 1.85% during the week.</p>
      <p>24-hour NFT sales on the Ethereum network declined for a third consecutive day, falling 23.64% to US$13.9 million, despite a 47.40% surge in 24-hour sales for Azuki, the leading NFT collection on Ethereum. 24-hour sales for the Bored Ape Yacht Club declined 58.7% to US$872,793, according to CryptoSlam data.</p>
      <p><strong>Equities</strong></p>
      <p>Asian equities were mixed on Friday. The Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.82%, the Shanghai Composite lost 0.48%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.12% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index increased 0.5%.</p>
      <p>Investors continued to assess the global monetary policy outlook after the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points this week.</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.43%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures strengthened 0.25% and the S&P 500 futures index gained 0.40%.</p>
      <p>U.S. nonfarm payroll data will be released later Friday. The world’s largest economy is expected to have added 180,000 jobs in April, which would be the smallest gain since December 2020, but well above the 70,000-100,000 monthly job gain needed to sustain the growth of the working-age demographic.</p>
      <p>The U.S. dollar fell 0.12% to 101.2 points, weighed down by recession fears and banking woes after shares of Los Angeles-based PacWest fell over 50% yesterday following a Bloomberg report that the lender was exploring a sale or other capital-raising moves in the wake of the recent collapse of other banks.</p>
      <p>Shares of Western Alliance bank holding company also plummeted over 60% on Thursday after a report alleged that it is exploring a potential sale. The company’s shares started recovering today after Western Alliance denied the report.</p>

        <li>Bitcoin's huge price rally this year is masking a decline in market liquidity.</li>
        <li>That means smaller bitcoin trades can have a bigger impact on the world's top cryptocurrency.</li>
        <li>A trade of 462 bitcoins can move the price by 1% versus more than 1,400 bitcoins in January, according to CCData.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Bitcoin has surged 70% so far this year, but market liquidity for the world's top cryptocurrency is drying up.</p>
    	<p>That means smaller trades can increasingly move bitcoin prices. For example, a purchase of 462 bitcoins ($13 million) at the end of last month was able to move the price by 1% versus more than 1,400 bitcoins ($23 million) in January, according to CCData, cited by the Financial Times.</p>	
    	<p>That's the lowest point of market depth for bitcoin trades via the stablecoin tether since May 2022, when the crypto market was reeling from price crashes and the failure of key industry players.</p>
      <p>Overall liquidity in the market has been declining since the start of the year, CCData research analyst Jacob Joseph told Insider over email.</p>
      <p>"It's worth noting that the decline in Binance's market share in April may have also contributed to the decline in liquidity for the above BTC-USDT pair," he added.</p>	
      <p>Binance's woes may be related to a crackdown by regulators on the crypto exchange firm. Meanwhile, last year's collapse of FTX and sister firm Alameda created a gap in liquidity that other crypto firms have been unable to fill, traders told the FT.</p>
      <p>And while bitcoin's price has been on the up, especially as banking turbulence caused renewed confidence in the currency, it has stagnated lately.</p>
    	<p>In recent weeks, bitcoin has languished in the $28,000-$29,000 range. That has coincided with outflows of $72 million in digital asset investments over the last two weeks after six consecutive weeks of inflows, according to CoinShares data cited by the FT.</p>

    	<h3>in this article</h3>
    	<p>Ordinals hit a new all-time high in terms of both daily inscriptions and fees paid. During the episode, BTC’s hashrate also increased, as did miners’ revenue </p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Ordinals’ block size decreased as the text type of ordinals grabbed the largest share of total inscriptions.</li>
        <li>BTC’s price might witness a correction soon, as suggested by a few metrics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bitcoin [BTC] Ordinals again made it to the limelight by registering massive growth in terms of the number of inscriptions. Daily inscriptions reached an all-time high of more than 300,000 on 1 May, pushing the total number of inscriptions to over 3 million. </p>	
    	<h3>key stats look encouraging</h3>
      <p>A look at the share of different types of Ordinals inscribed suggested that the majority of them were text type, which accounted for 79%. As per Dune’s data, text type Ordinals were followed by image type and others.</p>	
    	<p>Additionally, the increase in number of inscriptions was also accompanied by a massive surge in Ordinals fees paid, which also reached a new ATH on 2 May 2023.</p>
      <p>Tom Wan, a research analyst, pointed out an interesting development. Despite the massive increase in the number of inscriptions, the average block size decreased.</p>
      <p>The reason behind this decline was the dominance of text type Ordinals. As text type Ordinals’ size is less than that of image-type Ordinals, the average block size declined from its ATH of 2.5 MB to 1.57 MB.</p>
      <h3>Miners enjoyed the episode</h3>
      <p>Ordinals’ latest achievement also brought good news for miners. While Ordinals hit a new ATH, a hike in BTC’s hashrate was also seen, suggesting an influx of new miners in the network.</p>
      <p>Moreover, thanks to the increase in fees of Ordinals, miners also generated more revenue. As evident from Glassnode’s chart, miners’ total revenue in BTC registered a spike on 1 May, 2023.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin investors should consider this</h3>
      <p>Though things looked good for the miners, the same can’t be said for investors. A look at BTC’s hash ribbon displayed the possibility of the 60-day moving average (MA) flipping the 30-day MA.</p>
      <p>Such a flip suggests that the market is not appropriate for more accumulation. Therefore, if the flip happens, BTC might be subjected to a price correction.</p>
      <h3>The trouble is for real</h3>
      <p>CryptoQuant’s data revealed that at the time of writing, Bitcoin’s exchange reserve was increasing, suggesting higher selling pressure. The increased sell pressure was also proven by BTC’s red aSORP, which indicated that more investors were selling at a profit.</p>
      <p>In addition to that, BTC’s taker buy/sell ratio pointed out that selling sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market, which was also a negative signal. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s price increased by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours and at press time, it was trading at $28,481.10 with a market capitalization of over $551 billion.</p>

    	<h3>In this article</h3>
    	<p>As of 1 May, BTC’s hashrate reached a new all-time high of 473.87 EH/s. The spike in hashrate could be attributed to the rising Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions. However, despite this, BTC traded in the red at the time of writing.</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Transactions on the Bitcoin network soar to new highs attracting more mining revenue.</li>
        <li>Miner revenue also soared to a six-month high as of 1 May.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the world waits for the crypto market to regain some price excitement, something interesting is happening on the Bitcoin [BTC] blockchain. Its hash rate experienced a noteworthy surge that may have something to do with the Bitcoin ordinals.</p>	
    	<p>At press time, Bitcoin’s hash rate stood at 473.87 EH/s and witnessed a rise in the last 24 hours. This observation was significant because it wasn’t only the highest weekly hash rate level, but also the highest ever. The main significance of this observation was that it highlighted a surge in miner participation in the market.</p>	
    	<p>The hash rate spike was likely due to the rising Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions. They have been a key driving factor for organic transactions on the network other than BTC trading activities. This reflected a recent surge in Bitcoin daily transactions which also reached a new ATH on 1 May.</p>
      <p>More daily transactions translate to higher miner revenue. This explains why Bitcoin’s hash rate increased as miners added more hash rate to take advantage of the revenue-generating opportunities. Glassnode’s miner revenue metric confirmed the same.</p>
      <h3>Assessing the potential impact on Bitcoin’s price performance</h3>
      <p>Miner revenue soared to a new six-month high on 1 May. If you are like most, you are probably wondering whether the Bitcoin ordinals will have an impact on BTC’s price action. First, the ordinal inscriptions do not have a direct impact on Bitcoin demand even though transactions are on the rise. However, they would likely have an impact if Bitcoin miner reserves were up.</p>
      <p>A closer look at Bitcoin’s on-chain data confirmed that the transaction count has been on the rise for the last few days. However, the situation is different for miner reserves, which, at press time were down to their lowest level in the last three months.</p>
      <p>Dwindling miner reserves are usually not considered a healthy sign for the market. This is because it shows a lack of incentives for miners to hold, which aligns with the prevailing market sentiment. The declining miner reserves explain the disconnect in the surging demand for Bitcoin ordinals and Bitcoin’s price performance.</p>
      <p>BTC crashed by over 3% on 1 May, the same day that transaction count and hash rate soared to new ATHs. Bitcoin exchanged hands at $28,592 at press time after securing some bullish volumes. The price action did not share the same level of enthusiasm as the hash rate or transactions on the network.</p>

    	<h3>in this article</h3>
	    <p>According to data provided by blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, BTC reserves at U.S.-based exchanges declined sharply since the beginning of 2023.</p>
	    <ul>
        <li>Despite a decline across all exchanges, the fall in reserves appears to be more significant on U.S. exchanges.</li>
        <li>With macro uncertainty looming, investors shied away from taking bullish bets on BTC.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bitcoin [BTC] extended its decline for the second consecutive day as its price dipped below the important $28,000 level on 1 May. However, the king coin reversed the losses to an extent by reaching $28,006 at press time, data from CoinMarketCap revealed.</p>	
    	<p>While this reflected a drop of over 2% in the last 24 hours, on a weekly basis BTC surged 2.40%. With the collapse of another big banking institution, First Republic Bank, it remains to be seen if BTC can go unscathed like it did during the banking turmoil of March.</p>	
      <h3>Trust erodes in U.S. exchanges</h3>    	
      <p>While sentiment around Bitcoin has been bullish since the start of 2023, it faced hurdles in one of the biggest financial and crypto markets of the world, U.S. According to data provided by blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, BTC reserves at U.S.-based exchanges declined sharply since the beginning of 2023.</p>
      <p>The analysis highlighted that despite a long-term decline across all exchanges, the fall in reserves appears to be more significant on American exchanges. A strong reason behind the drop could be increased scrutiny by U.S. regulators on the way crypto assets are handled on centralized exchanges. Earlier this year, Kraken, the second-largest exchange in the U.S., had to cease its staking services after the SEC charged Kraken with a $30 million penalty over irregularities in the staking program.</p>
      <p>As a result, investors started to prefer self-custody and offshore exchanges to move their BTC holdings.</p>
      <p>Moreover, data from DeFiLlama highlighted the stark contrast between BTC holdings on U.S. based trading platforms and offshore platforms. The share of BTC tokens on Binance was more than 25% of the total, while on Binance.US, the entity which operates solely for U.S. customers, the share was drastically low.</p>
      <p>Similarly, BTC occupied a 31% share of all assets on the Seychelles-based exchange, OKX[OKB] while reserves of Bitfinex, based in Hong Kong, consisted of nearly 60% of BTC tokens.</p>
      <h3>BTC: Bullish sentiment wanes?</h3>
      <p>With macro uncertainty looming, investors shied away from taking bullish bets on BTC. Data from Coinglass pointed towards a sharp increase in the number of short positions vis-à-vis long positions.</p>

    	<h3>In this article</h3>
    	<p>ADA road to recovery may be filled with more bears than expected. At the time of writing, ADA didn’t see any buying pressure from traders despite a satisfactory roundup presented by the Cardano community.</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Cardano’s daily digest shared a number of developments that could act in favor of ADA’s growth.</li>
        <li>However, at the time of writing, ADA was exchanging hands at a loss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cardano’s [ADA] efforts with the Voltaire era helped the altcoin see some recovery on its Total Value Locked (TVL) and Long/Short Ratio front. However, as we step into a new month, the ecosystem had something more to offer to the community.</p>	
    	<p>The Twitter handle, Cardano Feed, published Cardano’s daily digest on 1 May and stated some important updates about the ecosystem. Adding to the Voltaire development, the roadmap presented other important updates related to the ecosystem.</p>	
    	<h3>Some high expectations doing the rounds</h3>
      <p>The Twitter thread highlighted Cardano’s collaboration with a next-gen Web3 gaming platform DEADPXLZ to develop its initial game on the Paima Engine. This would be integrated with Cardano.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the roundup also stated that the SummonsPlatform was launched on the Cardano mainnet. This would enable users to create and manage DAOs in a better way.</p>
      <p>With so much to offer, Cardano could be on a winning spree. However, was that the case with ADA’s price and its metrics? Let’s find out.</p>
      <h3>All about the bears</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, Cardano’s native token ADA didn’t exactly step up its game. This was because the token was exchanging hands at $0.3842 and stood in the red. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also stood at 44.28 and didn’t show any signs of making a recovery in the days to come.</p>
      <p>ADA’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator too witnessed a bearish crossover. Although, at press time, the signal and MACD line stayed above the zero line, it was only a matter of time before the two lines make their way past to the other side of zero.</p>
      <p>Data from the intelligence platform Santiment also seemed to be in support of the bears at the time of writing. Although ADA’s development activity did witness an uptrend over the last few days, at press time, it slipped. ADA’s development activity stood at 83.83, which was a drop from the chain’s development activity over the last few days.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a look at the number of holders also didn’t make a significant recovery at the time of writing and moved in a sideways direction. However, ADA did manage to maintain its social dominance despite a bearish outlook on most fronts.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as per data from CoinMarketCap, ADA was trading 0.18% lower in the last 24 hours and 3.46% lower over the last seven days. Thus, ADA traders would have to tread slowly at least over the next few days.</p>
      <p>However, despite ADA being controlled by the bears, the Cardano Foundation shared some good news with the community. As of 1 May, Cardano’s on-chain stats managed to show some growth.</p>
      <p>This could, thus, change the state of ADA but only if investors managed to garner some bullish momentum.</p>

    	<h3>In this article</h3>
    	<p>Over the last 10 days, most large addresses stepped up their game in accumulating SHIB. As of this writing, 615.19 trillion SHIBs were sitting in whales’ wallets.</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Technical indicators sounded a bearish alarm for SHIB at press time.</li>
        <li>SHIB’s burn rate surged 36% in the last 24 hours but dropped 93% on a weekly basis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In what was a clear indication of growing demand for Shiba Inu [SHIB], a major whale snapped up more than 168 billion tokens in the last two days of trading, as per information from Etherscan. With the press time price of SHIB, the transactions were worth more than $1.72 million.</p>	
    	<p>As a result of the buying spree, SHIB became the most traded token among top Ethereum [ETH] whales over the last 24 hours, as per crypto whale tracking website Whalestats.</p>	
    	<h3>SHIB accumulation on the rise</h3>
      <p>The data from Etherscan revealed that the whale in question started with modest quantities, but quickly escalated to amass a whopping 108 billion SHIBs in a transaction executed a day and 14 hours before press time.</p>
      <p>However, it was interesting to note that the whale offloaded more than 49 billion tokens, indicating that an intense to-and-fro movement of SHIB was happening in the market.</p>
      <p>A staggering 5.15 trillion SHIB, worth more than $52 million, was held by the whale at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>Over the last 10 days, most large addresses stepped up their game in accumulating SHIB. As of this writing, 615.19 trillion SHIBs were sitting pretty in whales’ wallets, as per Santiment data.</p>
      <p>As large addresses started to hodl SHIB tokens, supply on exchanges dipped. Over the last 10 days, SHIB’s balance on centralized exchanges dropped from over 90 trillion to 89.2 trillion at press time.</p>
      <h3>The burn is real</h3>
      <p>Data from Shibburn revealed that SHIB’s burn rate surged by 36.97% in the last 24 hours, with more than 3.37 million tokens removed out of circulation.</p>
      <p>However, on a weekly basis, there was a significant decline of 93% from the previous week. As of this writing, SHIB had a circulating supply of 589.54 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>
      <p>SHIB exchanged hands at $0.00001029 at press time, up 0.33% in the last 24-hour period. The token was yet to embark on an upward momentum since the 19 April decline. The price kept moving sideways over the last few days of trading.</p>
      <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continued to move below the neutral level, implying that bearish sentiments were strong. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was below the signal line, reinforcing the strong selling pressure narrative.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin could climb by $20,000 if a US default happens, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said.</li>
        <li>Not every crypto would act similarly, with some behaving more like equities, he told Insider.</li>
        <li>"So actually, the optimal trade would probably be long bitcoin, short ethereum."</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>With the looming debt ceiling crisis showing no signs of a resolution, both bond and equity markets have become jittery.</p>
    	<p>But while some investors are fearful of a historic default, one asset could potentially rise through such a situation: Bitcoin.</p>	
    	<p>Describing a US default as a "low-probability, high-impact event," Geoff Kendrick, head of FX research at Standard Chartered, said it may cause the bitcoin to jump by about $20,000, representing an increase of 68% from current levels.</p>	
    	<p>He told Insider that's because the top cryptocurrency by market cap has a reputation for performing well in periods of stress and is often seen as a safe haven, especially as it is a decentralized asset.</p>
      <p>But Kendrick doesn't think bitcoin would rally in a straight line in the event of a US default, saying "it probably comes a bit lower on day one or day two or week." In that case, bitcoin could dip by $5,000 initially, then jump by $25,000, he estimated.</p>
      <p>And not every cryptocurrency would follow bitcoin's behavior, he added, with others like ethereum trading more like stocks, which would likely fall in a default.</p>
      <p>"So actually, the optimal trade would probably be long bitcoin, short ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this," Kendrick said.</p>
      <p>If Congress fails to lift the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit, a default could come sometime in the summer — an event that could cause seismic ruptures global markets. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned a default would be catastrophic for the US economy, sparking mass unemployment, payment failures, and higher rates "into perpetuity."</p>
      <p>With House Republicans and the White House still far from a deal to raise the debt ceiling, yields on three-month Treasurys recently jumped to a 22-year high, as they would mature around a potential default date.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, bitcoin is still recovering from a massive sell-off that began in late 2021 and continued through much of 2022 as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle.</p>
      <p>But bitcoin has rallied nearly 80% so far in 2023 and recently neared $30,000 as First Republic Bank's woes reignited fears over the financial sector.</p>
      <p>For his part, Kendrick is already bullish on bitcoin, saying in a note on Monday that it could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024 due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things, though it didn't mention the risk of a US default.</p>
      <p>"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer," he wrote.</p>

    	<p>However, current market data suggested that the ongoing upside might be limited. Understanding the reasons for the rally could help gauge the strength of the current bull run.</p>	
    	<p>ETH and most of the crypto market gained bullish momentum following reports that another bank was at risk of collapse. More so, the price surge was backed by a wave of short-term calls which may offer some insights into what to expect.</p>
      <p>The above findings suggested a high probability that the rally might be short-lived since the short-term calls were focused on short-term profits. But this does not necessarily guarantee that prices will not extend their upside in the short-to-mid-term.</p>
      <p><strong>Assessing the likelihood of a strong ETH rally</strong></p>
      <p>ETH’s upside will largely depend on whale activity. So what are ETH whales currently up to?</p>
      <p>Supply distribution showed a slowdown in sell pressure, especially from some whale categories. This included addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH.</p>
      <p>This could be considered noteworthy because the aforementioned category controls most of the circulating supply hence it has the biggest impact on price movements.</p>
      <p>The potential upside may also be limited by some whales that have been taking profits in the last 24 hours. In addition, ETH exchange flows indicated that exchange inflows maintained a dominant position over exchange outflows.</p>
      <p>The surge in short-term calls reflected the spike in funding rates in the last 24 hours. This confirmed that there was strong demand for ETH in the derivatives segment.</p>
      <p>We also saw a drop in leverage in the last few days due to liquidations and market uncertainty. However, the demand for leverage registered a small bounce back in the last 24 hours indicating a return of confidence.</p>
      <p><strong>A quick look at the price action…</strong></p>
      <p>ETH exchanged hands at $1,953 at press time, which represented an 8.29% upside in the last two days. The bullish wave facilitated a healthy bounce after a brief interaction with the 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>ETH’s MFI maintained a downward trend in the last two days despite the sharp bounce back in the last two days. This lends credence to the expectations of a limited upside.</p>
      <p>However, investors should also note that the unexpected may also happen just as has been the case with the sudden pivot. ETH and other top cryptos may continue rallying higher if another banking contagion ensues.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin’s long liquidations on 26 April soared to their highest level so far in April. The liquidations also triggered a sharp drop in the estimated leverage ratio as leverage traders quickly shifted to the side of caution.</p>
    	<ul>
        <li>Bitcoin leverage traders felt the heat as unexpected crash triggers heavy liquidations.</li>
        <li>Bulls still in charge despite the liquidation shock.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bitcoin [BTC] traders were in for a rollercoaster of price performance during 26 April’s trading session. Bitcoin briefly managed to rally back above $30,000, leading to euphoria about its bullish prospects but another crash sent it below $28,000.</p>	
    	<p>To put things into perspective, Bitcoin’s market cap fell by roughly $49.13 billion from its highest point on that day. This officially makes 26 April the most volatile day in the last seven days. Note that, despite the sharp crash the market cap recovered slightly.</p>	
	    <p><strong>Leveraged long liquidations fueled the Bitcoin volatility</strong></p>
      <p>The $30,000 retest attracted an unusual amount of volatility. One major reason for this is that the price was previously on a bearish trend, followed by a brief period of uncertainty regarding market direction.</p>
      <p>However, the midweek outcome demonstrated a return of bullish volumes, hence the uptick and retest of the $30,000 range which previously demonstrated resistance.</p>
      <p>Many traders saw the recovery as a sign of demand and a possible push past the resistance range. As such, many traders in the derivatives segment were convinced that Bitcoin would offer a good rally, hence they embraced leverage. This explains why Bitcoin’s recent slap-down resulted in heavy liquidations.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s long liquidations on 26 April soared to their highest level so far in the month. The liquidations also triggered a sharp drop in the estimated leverage ratio as leverage traders quickly shifted to the side of caution.</p>
      <p>The Bitcoin long liquidations highlight some of the risks in the market. Some analysts believe that the recent rally was a setup for whales to secure exit liquidity.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s brief rally presented the perfect opportunity for a leverage shakedown. Traders were high on hopium given that the market previously struggled to find enough momentum.</p>
      <p>The news that another major bank was in trouble further supported the bullish expectations. Investors should also note that there might also be a bear trap ahead.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin has already recovered slightly in the last few hours to its $28,995 press time price. The timing is particularly noteworthy because most investors will be sitting on the sidelines after the mid-week events.</p>
      <p>There is still some uncertainty regarding BTC’s next move, especially as the market rolls into a new month.</p>

            <p>Trading volume on Binance of bitcoin (BTC) denominated in ArchBlock's dollar-pegged stablecoin trueUSD (TUSD) has surged over the past four weeks after the crypto exchange introduced zero trading fees in the pair on March 23 while simultaneously reintroducing fees for all other pairs.</p>
            <p>Still, the trade denominated in tether (USDT), the largest dollar-pegged stablecoin by market value, remains the most liquid, allowing large orders to execute with relatively less impact on the cryptocurrency's price than the TUSD trade.</p>	
            <p>"Market depth data on Binance shows us that BTC-USDT is still king from a liquidity standpoint, with market makers evidently more comfortable with exposure to Tether over TUSD," Conor Ryder, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said in a market update last week.</p>	
            <p>Liquidity conditions are commonly assessed with the help of a metric called market depth – a collection of buy and sell offers within 1% or 2% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.</p>
          <p>The more significant the depth, the more liquid an asset is said to be and the less the slippage. Slippage is the difference between the expected price at which a trade is placed and the actual price at which the transaction is executed. Slippage usually occurs when there is low market liquidity or high volatility.</p>
          <p>The chart shows liquidity in BTC/USDT was $30 million at the 1% depth last week or 200% greater than $10 million in BTC/TUSD. In other words, traders might be better off executing large orders in the BTC/USDT pairs than the BTC/TUSD pair.</p>
          <p>TUSD's market depth has improved sharply from practically zero to $10 million in a month, surpassing BUSD to become the second-most liquid pair on Binance.</p>
          <p>The BTC-TUSD pair accounted for 50% of the total bitcoin market volume on Binance last week.</p>
          <p>"For as long as zero-fee trading lasts on BTC-TUSD, TUSD needs to be considered a top stablecoin in crypto, whether people like it or not. Similar to how Binance favored BUSD, TUSD is the benefactor of increased volumes now, even if the reasons why Binance granted TUSD this gift are unclear," Ryder said.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>However, total investments in digital asset products saw outflows of around US$30 million last week, ending a six-week run of inflows, the report said. Bitcoin had seen inflows of US$310 million in the prior four weeks but last week saw outflows of US$53 million.</li>
          <li>“The outflows began the prior Friday [April 14] when Bitcoin reached the very psychological level of US$30,000, suggesting the most recent sell-off was a result of profit-taking, particularly in the absence of any macro-economic triggers,” the CoinShares report says.</li>
          <li>Developers of the Ethereum blockchain on April 12 updated the network with new features including allowing the withdrawal of staked Ether. Such tokens were deposited to support the operations of the Ethereum blockchain, the world’s second-biggest, in return for a passive income, usually in the form of more tokens.</li>
          <li>As of 11 a.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong, around 1.66 million staked Ether (US$3.04 billion) have been withdrawn since the April 12 upgrade, with another 1.07 million Ether deposited for staking, according to data from Token Unlocks. About 616,500 Ether are awaiting withdrawal.</li>
          <li>Ether dipped 1.76% in the past 24 hours to trade at US$1,834, and lost 11.93% in the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin fell 1.22% in the last 24 hours to change hands at US$27,399, logging a 7.06% weekly drop.</li>

          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin fell 1.22% to US$27,461 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong for a loss of 6.51% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency retreated to US$27,070 at one stage on Tuesday morning, the lowest price since March 28.</li>
            <li>Ether dropped 1.88% to US$1,841, losing 11.25% for the week and wiping out its gains since April 12 from the Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
            <li>XRP led the losers, dropping 4.75% to US$0.4596 for a seven-day loss of 10.27%.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin’s slide over the past week is investors taking profit following the token’s surge so far this year, according to a Monday blog post by digital asset investment firm CoinShares, noting an outflow of US$30 million from digital asset investment products in the week ending April 21, interrupting a 6 week run of inflows.</li>
            <li>However, Ether saw an inflow of US$17 million in the past week, which suggests some confidence among Ether investors after the Shanghai upgrade.</li>
            <li>Despite the widespread profit-taking, the U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank on Monday said Bitcoin could reach US$100,000 by the end of 2023 on the back of recent failures of traditional banks, a rebound in profits in crypto mining, and the potential end of the U.S. monetary tightening cycle, according to Reuters.</li>
            <li>Litecoin managed to log gains despite the overall downtrend, rising 0.76% to US$87.99. This followed a tweet from Litecoin noting the token’s third halving event is in 100 days, which will make the coin more scarce. Still, it has some ground to make up as it’s lost 11.09% for the past seven days.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization dipped 1.20% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 28.71% to US$38.23 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.57% to 3,755.63 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 7.23% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</li>
            <li>The underperformance of the NFT market could be attributed to a surge in gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain, following the recent rise of memecoin PEPE. However, the memecoin, launched on April 14, fell 18.81% to US$0.0000002626 in the 24 hours to 7 p.m. on Monday in Hong Kong. The coin is still up over 392% on the weekly chart and has a market capitalization of around US$116 million, according to DEXTools.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched 0.04% lower. The S&P 500 dipped 0.10% and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged down 0.09%. The three indexes closed mixed in regular Monday trading on Wall Street, with investors facing a week busy with inflation gauges and earnings from U.S. corporations.</li>
            <li>178 of the S&P 500 companies will release first-quarter earnings this week, including Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta.</li>
            <li>On the inflation front, investors are also facing U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) on Thursday and personal consumer expenditures on Friday, which will provide an insight into the broader U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s possible next move on interest rates. Analysts project annual growth of 2.5% in U.S. real GDP, down from 2.6% in the previous quarter.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Analysts at the CME Group now see a 16% chance the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on May 3, while 84% predict a 25-basis-point increase, down from 89.1% on Monday.</li>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade brought a record-breaking weekly inflow of ether (ETH) deposits for staking last week, mainly driven by institutional staking service providers and investors reinvesting rewards after withdrawal, crypto analysts said.</p>
            <p>Investors deposited some 571,950 ETH tokens into staking contracts, worth more than $1 billion, according to a Dune Analytics data dashboard created by Tom Wan, an analyst of digital asset investment firm 21Shares.</p>	
            <p>This was the largest weekly token inflow in ether staking’s almost two-and-a-half-year history, per blockchain data provided by 21Shares.</p>	
            <p>The Ethereum blockchain completed its highly anticipated tech upgrade, often called Shanghai or Shapella, on April 12. The initiative enabled the withdrawal of tokens previously locked-up in staking contracts for the first time. It was the last key step after last year’s Merge to complete the network’s transition to validating transactions through staking from a mining-based system.</p>
          <p>ETH, the network’s native token and the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin (BTC), surged following the successful implementation of the upgrade, but relinquished all its gains last week in a broader crypto market sell-off, caused mostly by macroeconomic concerns about inflation and a looming recession.</p>
          <p><strong>Institutional ETH staking</strong></p>
          <p>Institutional staking services drove the deposit surge in ETH staking, Wan tweeted.</p>
          <p>Since the Shanghai upgrade went live, the top five institutional-grade staking service providers – Bitcoin Suisse, Figment, Kiln, Staked.us and Stakefish – staked a total of 235,330 ETH combined, worth some $450 million, according to 21Shares’ Dune dashboard.</p>
          <p>CoinDesk reported last week that the Shanghai upgrade boosted demand for ETH staking among institutional investors, including traditional finance firms.</p>
          <p>The increased interest also highlights that enabling withdrawals from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain has significantly reduced the liquidity risk associated with locking up tokens, Wan added in a separate tweet.</p>
          <p><strong>Restaking rewards</strong></p>
          <p>Another likely catalyst for the record inflow has been investors choosing to reinvest their previously earned and withdrawn rewards from staking, Anders Helseth, vice president of digital asset market research firm K33 Research, explained in an emailed note.</p>
          <p>Through the first eight days after the upgrade, investors withdrew some 900,000 ETH in staking rewards. Meanwhile, staking deposits totaled some 667,000 tokens, which was six times larger than the amount deposited during the last eight days before allowing withdrawals.</p>
          <p>The dynamic indicates that investors decided to restake a large part of the withdrawn rewards, Helseth wrote.</p>
          <p><strong>Reduced selling pressure</strong></p>
          <p>The Shanghai upgrade was a “net positive” in terms of total staking inflows, Noelle Achison, a market analyst and former head of research at Genesis Trading and CoinDesk (both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group), wrote in a newsletter Monday.</p>
          <p>“So far, the rhythm of new deposits has exceeded the amount leaving the network, if rewards can be excluded,” she said.</p>
          <p>The reason for differentiating reward withdrawals from full exits comes from how Ethereum’s staking system works. Individual stakers or staking services have to lock up exactly 32 ETH to open a node and earn rewards for securing the network. Keeping the accrued rewards in the validator node does not improve the node’s return. Acheson explained that it’s logical for stakers to withdraw rewards, bundle the tokens and establish new nodes to increase potential returns.</p>
          <p>“It seems this is what is happening,” she said. “Overall net inflow has been positive, which suggests that a significant portion of these rewards are being restaked.”</p>
          <p>The trend of reinvesting rewards is also potentially a positive sign for ETH price as it reduces sell pressure, according to Acheson, “which is likely to end up being much less than many feared.“</p>

          <p>The retest of the bullish order block at $5.2 saw the bulls come up with only a meek response. The market structure of Filecoin also pointed toward a downtrend.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The daily market structure flipped bearish after the drop beneath $5.6.</li>
            <li>The swift losses left an imbalance that could be filled in the coming days.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The rejection at $6.43 on 15 April was an alarming development for Filecoin. A recent report highlighted how the fall below $6 reinforced bearish pressure. At the time of writing, an imbalance on the charts could offer sellers an opportunity to short FIL upon a bounce.</p>	
          <p>The metrics were not encouraging for Filecoin either. There were many issues that the network faced, and the selling pressure across the market did not help FIL bulls. The $5 support would likely not withstand a bearish assault.</p>	
          <p><strong>The retest of a bullish order block noted underwhelming buying pressure</strong></p>
          <p>A bullish order block on the daily timeframe was highlighted in cyan. It saw a sharp break in the previous market structure and flipped it to bullish on 13 March. The buyers were unable to sustain that pressure in the weeks since.</p>
          <p>Instead, when the price ventured into the order block and as deep as the $5.2 support, the bulls were able to come up with only a meek response. They were unable to drive the rally past $6.4, and the market structure was bearish once more.</p>
          <p>The RSI was at 40 showing downward momentum, and the 21 and 55-period moving averages showed bearishness as well. Surprisingly the CMF revealed strong capital inflow to FIL markets over the past ten days. It remained uncertain if this can fuel a rally.</p>
          <p>A fair value gap was spotted in the $5.87 area. A retest of this region could see the downtrend continue. Therefore short sellers can look to re-enter after a bearish reaction from the $5.82-$6.02 area.</p>
          <p><strong>Liquidation data showed bulls severely hurt, short-term sentiment in bearish favor</strong></p>
          <p>According to Coinglass data, long positions worth $3.85 million were liquidated within a 4-hour timespan on 19 April. Since then, long positions continued to suffer much more than the sellers. Over the past 24 hours, the long/short ratio showed 51% of market participants were shorting the asset.</p>
          <p>The Open Interest data showed discouraged bulls as well. The OI had been falling almost as rapidly as the price. FIL saw a bounce from $5.1 to $5.35 in the past 36 hours.</p>
          <p>The OI continued to stay at the $120 million mark during this time, therefore we can conclude that bullish speculators remained sidelined.</p>

            <li>That's due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things.</li>

          </ul>
            <p>The crypto winter has melted away, and bitcoin is set to flourish, a Standard Chartered note forecasted on Monday.</p>
            <p>The world's biggest digital currency by market cap could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024, the bank said, representing a 268% increase from current levels.</p>	
            <p>"We see potential for Bitcoin to reach the USD 100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted 'crypto winter' is finally over," wrote Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick.</p>	
            <p>One of the reasons for the bullish outlook is the turmoil caused by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse last month. As worries of a banking contagion spread, bitcoin re-established its use case as a "decentralized, trustless and scarce digital asset," according to the note.</p>
          <p>At the same time, key rivals to bitcoin lost ground, especially stablecoins, some of which lost their peg to the US dollar. In fact, some of the assets that backed their value were held in SVB.</p>
          <p>"Against this backdrop, Bitcoin has benefited from its status as a branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance," Kendrick added.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered now sees bitcoin's share of the total crypto market cap rising to the 50%-60% range, up from 45% today and from 40% before the SVB collapse.</p>
          <p>In addition, the note said bitcoin's recent rebound back above $30,000 also represented a turnaround for crypto miners, who previously had seen mining margins get squeezed.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin has since dipped below $30,000, but Kendrick said if prices remain well above mining costs ($15,000), miners will likely hold onto what they mine instead of selling.</p>
          <p>"This creates price upside, in our view. In addition, with energy prices likely having peaked, the structural profitability backdrop for miners should improve, adding further upside," he wrote.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin is also set to trade better in the future as the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its tightening cycle, Kendrick said, noting that its correlation with the Nasdaq suggests the crypto should trade better if risk-on assets improve broadly.</p>
          <p>Another tailwind is the coin's upcoming halving in 2024, which is when the reward given to miners is cut in half. This is to cap the supply of bitcoins, and has historically led to price increases.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin could also see upswings thanks to regulatory changes that promote investor access to the market — such as the creation of digital asset ETFs and stablecoin regulation. Already, some proposals that have been passed in Europe hold positive implications on crypto volatility.</p>
          <p>"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer," Kendrick said.</p>

            <p>An important bearish order block lay at the $6.6 region, but it has been broken over the past week. The market structure was bullish and the RSI remained above neutral 50 as well, supporting the idea of upward momentum.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Polkadot has breached an important area of resistance.</li>
            <li>Although the reaction wasn’t strongly bullish yet, it was likely that DOT would rally toward $7.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Polkadot has performed well on the price charts over the past two weeks. The token has noted gains of 15% measuring from 9 April to 18 April, and more green could follow.</p>	
            <p>Bitcoin was also quick to recover after a drop to the $29.2k level, which suggested buyers had some strength, but not enough to force another rally.</p>	
            <p>Polkadot bulls managed to drive prices above a bearish order block which acted as a stern resistance since 27 February. This move meant further gains could materialize in the coming days.</p>
          <h3>The bullish breaker could be retested once more</h3>
          <p>The bearish order block mentioned previously lay at the $6.6 region, but over the past week, it has been broken. A 4-hour trading session close above the order block flipped it to a bullish breaker, and so far, buyers have defended this area. It was highlighted in cyan, and it was likely to be tested once more.</p>
          <p>This was because the most recent lower timeframe pump went from $6.57 to $7 on 18 April. This surge in prices occurred quickly and left behind an imbalance on the charts. If this fair value gap, extending from $6.72 to $6.82, was retested, it would likely give a bullish reaction.</p>
          <p>The market structure was bullish and the RSI remained above neutral 50 as well, supporting the idea of upward momentum. The OBV has been flat over the past week, which was not an encouraging finding after the move above $6.6.</p>
          <p>Hence, buyers can look to enter a test of the FVG, targeting the next H4 bearish order block at the $7.22 area (red box).</p>
          <p>This idea will be invalidated if DOT closes a 4-hour session at $6.56. Such a session close will be discouraging for the bears, who have spent the past two weeks trying to force a move above the resistance. A fall beneath $6.6 will likely see $6 tested as support.</p>
          <h3>Futures markets showed long positions were discouraged in recent hours</h3>
          <p>Coinalyze data showed the funding rate was positive, and hadn’t changed much in the past ten days. This highlighted a bullish bias but the Open Interest told a slightly different story.</p>
          <p>In the past 24 hours, OI dropped by $7 million after a 2.5% slide in DOT prices. This suggested some bearish sentiment on the lower timeframes. If this continued, or if the OI rose alongside falling prices, it would highlight the heightened bearish sentiment.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin slid below the US$29,000 mark for the first time in 10 days on Thursday morning in Asia. Ether also fell to lose hold of the US$2,000 price support in a sell off across all top 10 non-stablecoin tokens. Some commentators ascribed the declines to a repricing based on recent concerns about inflation and higher interest rates ahead. Litecoin led the losers. U.S. equity futures dipped after Wall Street closed flat to lower on Wednesday.</p>
            <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin fell 4.59% to US$28,943 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 3.59%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency lost about US$1,000 in an hour starting from 4:00 p.m. Hong Kong on Wednesday.</li>
            <li>Ether slumped 7.20% to US$1,947, but remains 1.93% higher for the past seven days. The token traded below the US$2,000 mark for the first time since April 13, when the Ethereum blockchain completed its Shanghai upgrade.</li>
            <li>Litecoin led the losers with a drop of 10.50% in the past 24 hours and traded at US$90.85, falling 1.39% for the week.</li>
            <li>The latest selloff in cryptocurrencies is an overdue correction following the rally this year and investors taking profits as a risk-off trend emerged in global markets, according to a CNBC report on Wednesday citing Joel Kruger, market strategist at forex and crypto platform Lmax Group.</li>
            <li>The risk-off mood follows more global inflation signals. The U.K. on Wednesday reported a 10.1% annual increase in the consumer price index for March, beating projections for a 9.8% gain. Also this week, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said it’s too early to consider an interest rate cut, given the stubborn U.S. inflation rate, which stood at 5% in March, compared to the Fed’s goal of 2%.</li>
            <li>Lmax Group tweeted on Thursday the crypto market “has been forced to have a serious rethink about how it has been pricing” with respect to monetary policies.</li>
            <li>Another down arrow is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday, who said much of the business model of the cryptocurrency sector has been built around non-compliance with securities regulations.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization fell 5.04% in the past 24 hours to US$1.21 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 33.08% to US$62.36 billion.</li>
            <li>In the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.23% to 4,012.98 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but remained 0.74% higher for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.11%. The S&P 500 futures fell 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite Index moved down 0.35%.</li>
            <li>The three U.S. equity indexes stalled on Wednesday on softer first-quarter earning reports, while the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey on economic conditions published on Wednesday shows a sharp fall in lending after the failure of a trio of regional banks last month.</li>
            <li>Negatives for crypto from the bank failures include “dwindling liquidity driven by strong risk-off sentiments and regulatory pressures impacting banking access for the sector,” Ben Ritchie, director of Digital Capital Management AU said in a report by information services platform Finder.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Analysts at the CME Group now see a 16.7% chance the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on May 3, while 83.3% predict a 25-basis-point increase, down from 84.8% on Wednesday.</li>

          <p>Shanghai is finally behind us, with the hike above $2,000 evidence of ETH’s bullishness. What next though?</p>
            <p>Disclaimer: The datasets shared in the following article have been compiled from a set of online resources and do not reflect AMBCrypto’s own research on the subject.</p>
            <p>In the four days following the launch of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, crypto-exchanges noted net inflows of 179,500 ether (ETH), worth around $375 million.</p>	
            <p>In fact, according to CryptoQuant statistics, traders deposited 1,101,079 ETH to exchanges between 13 April and 16 April, but only removed 921,579 tokens. This was the month’s greatest four-day net inflow.</p>
          <p>Transferring tokens to exchanges typically implies that investors are prepared to sell, which may result in a decline in its price.</p>
          <p>For the first time since August, Ethereum, the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency, has hiked past the $2000-mark on the charts. Even though the optimism seemed to be dissipating, ETH was still valued at above $2k at press time.</p>	
            <p>This is interesting, especially since after bottoming out in June 2022 at about $880, the price of ETH has more than doubled. This, despite several unfavourable developments such as the demise of FTX, a rise in interest rates, and stricter U.S. regulations.</p>
          <p>Here, it is important to note that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculates inflation or the rate of growth in product and service prices. As a result, traders and investors predict that the US Federal Reserve will opt to postpone or slow down its intentions to hike interest rates at its next meeting if the CPI report indicates a high level of inflation.</p>
          <p>Ethereum (ETH), the token that powers the world’s leading smart contracts platform, was valued at over $2085, at the time of writing. Needless to say, cynicism around Shanghai seemed to be unwarranted. </p>
          <p>As a result, ETH/USD has drawn an ascending triangle, which is supported and opposed by a rising trendline and horizontal level, respectively. As lows rise steadily and highs hover around the same level, the pattern points to aggressive purchasing at these price levels.</p>
          <p>Speculations around Shanghai weren’t without reason, however. Especially since ETH was once valued at over $3,700, just over a year ago.</p>
          <p>Even so, the short-term sell-off event that was expected to follow the update, one which will allow stakers to withdraw their vested tokens from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract, has not come to pass. At least, not yet.</p>
          <p>The Ethereum community seems to be supportive of Coinbase’s recently revealed layer-2 network, Base, which has been called a “watershed moment” and a “huge confidence vote” for the blockchain network.</p>
          <p>Base, a layer-2 network driven by Optimism and secured on Ethereum, seeks to eventually develop into a network for creating decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain. According to Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, the layer-2 network is now in its testnet phase.</p>
          <p>The move is “a massive vote of confidence for Ethereum,” according to Ryan Sean Adams, host of the Bankless Show. This could set a precedent for cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions to use Ethereum as their preferred settlement layer.</p>
          <p>Recently, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, donated $150,000 in ETH to Syrian and Turkish victims. Additionally, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, ETH, experienced a significant price drop after whales sold 350,000 ETH tokens.</p>
          <p>According to Diogo Mónica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital, a cryptocurrency bank with a market cap of over $3 billion, the Merge’s success transformed Ethereum from “a smart contract platform lagging behind” into “something that was doing things properly.” This is accurate: After the Merge, institutional interest in ETH staking rose, according to Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise Asset Management.</p>
          <p>As ETH dominance has increased compared to other cryptocurrencies over the past few years, Ether’s bullish setup vs Bitcoin is apparent. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have consolidated over the week as the broader crypto market continues to enjoy a bullish spell.</p>
          <p>The price of Ethereum has lately undergone a significant correction, yet the whales have been purchasing at every decline. The fifth-largest accumulation day in a year was recorded last week as ETH whale activity reached a new level. As the FTX problem developed over this month of November, Ethereum whales have been building up. According to a Santiment report,</p>
          <p><strong>“Ethereum’s large key addresses have been growing in number since the #FTX debacle in early November. Pictured are the key moments where shark & whale addresses have accumulated & dumped. The number of 100 to 100k $ETH addresses is at a 20-month high.”</strong></p>
          <p>It almost reached the lows during the FTX collapse-driven meltdown of the cryptocurrency market, but it rapidly bounced back and was able to maintain above those levels as well. This strengthens the argument since Ethereum has typically outperformed Bitcoin.</p>
          <p>Given everything, buying Ethereum must be a sound investment in the long term, right? Most experts have positive predictions for ETH. Furthermore, the bulk of long-term Ethereum price projections are upbeat.</p>
          <h3>Why are projections important?</h3>
          <p>Since Ethereum has seen phenomenal growth in recent years, it is not surprising that investors are placing significant bets on this cryptocurrency. Ethereum gained traction after the price of Bitcoin dropped in 2020, following a protracted period of stagnation in 2018 and 2019.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, much of the altcoin market remained idle even after the halving. One of the few that picked up the momentum quickly is Ethereum. Ethereum had increased by 200% from its 2017 highs by the end of 2021.</p>
          <p>Ethereum may experience such a spike thanks to several crucial factors. One of these is an upgrade to the Ethereum network, specifically a move to Ethereum 2.0. Another reason is the Ethereum tokenomics debate. With the switch to Ethereum 2.0, ether tokenomics will become even more deflationary. As a result, there won’t be as many tokens on the market to meet increasing demand. The outcome might increase Ethereum’s rising momentum in the future.</p>
          <p>In this article, we’ll take a quick look at the cryptocurrency market’s recent performance, paying particular attention to market cap and volume. The most well-known analysts’ and platforms’ predictions will be summarized at the end, along with a look at the Fear & Greed Index to gauge market sentiment.</p>
          <h3>Ethereum’s price, volume, and everything in between</h3>
          <p>At press time, ETH was trading at $2085 with a market capitalization of $241.6 billion. Over the last 7 days, ETH had appreciated by 10% on the charts.</p>
          <p>Even though it’s difficult to forecast the price of a volatile cryptocurrency, most experts concur that ETH may once again cross the $4,000 barrier in 2023. And, according to a recent forecast by Bloomberg intelligence analyst Mike McGlone, the price of Ethereum will conclude the year between $4,000 and $4,500.</p>
          <p>Additionally, according to a report by Kaiko last year, ETH’s market share of trading volume will reach 50% parity with Bitcoin’s for the first time in 2023.</p>
          <p>According to Kaiko, ETH outpaced Bitcoin in July last year as a result of significant inflows into the spot and derivative markets. Most exchanges have seen this surge, which can be an indication of returning investors. Additionally, a rise in average trade size is the exact reverse of what has been seen so far in 2022’s downturn.</p>
          <p>In fact, a majority of cryptocurrency influencers are bullish on Ethereum and anticipate it to reach incredible highs.</p>
          <p>While the broader Ethereum community was looking forward to the environment-friendly PoS update, a faction emerged in favor of a fork that will retain the energy-intensive PoW model.</p>
          <p>The faction was mostly made up of miners who risk losing their investment in expensive mining equipment since the update would render their business model useless. Prominent Chinese miner Chandler Guo stated on Twitter that an ETHPoW is “coming soon”.</p>
          <p>At the time, Binance clarified that in the event of a fork which creates a new token, the ETH ticker will be reserved for the Ethereum PoS chain, adding that “withdrawals for the forked token will be supported”. Stablecoin projects Tether and Circle both reiterated their exclusive support for the Ethereum PoS chain after the Merge.</p>
          <p>TradingView expressed the same opinion at the time this article was written, and their technical analysis of the Ethereum price indicated that it was a “Buy” signal for ETH.</p>
          <p>In fact, PwC’s Crypto-head Henri Arslanian claimed in an edition of First Mover that “Ethereum is the only show in town.” However, investors will need to witness increased demand and functioning for Ether’s price to keep climbing.</p>
          <p>According to investor and creator of the cryptocurrency research and media organization Token Metrics Ian Balina, “I think Ethereum can go to $8,000.”</p>
          <h3>ETH Whale Activity</h3>
          <p>On 27 March, blockchain analytics firm Santiment revealed that almost 90% of Ethereum’s supply was stored in self-custody addresses. The last time the figure was so high was nearly eight years ago in 2015, shortly after the protocol’s native token saw the light of day. This was happening as users are withdrawing their assets from Binance that is facing CFTC’s investigation.</p>
          <p>This essential all-time low ratio of ETH on exchanges (10.31%) indicated confidence from hodlers.</p>
          <p>Data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows ETH supply held by the top addresses on crypto exchanges has been on the rise since early June. On the other hand, ETH supply held by the top non-exchange addresses i.e. ETH held in hardware wallets, digital wallets etc. has been declining since early June. But why June? Because it was around that time that a tentative timeline for the Merge was disclosed to the community.</p>
          <p>Also, Santiment had tweeted that over the past 3 months, whales had beefed up their exchange holdings by 78%.</p>
          <p>So what does this mean? It means that Ethereum whales are moving their ETH onto exchanges. Top ETH hodlers are taking their supply out of cold storage and moving it to exchanges, most likely to facilitate a quick transaction if needed.</p>
          <p>In the run up to the merge, a number of exchanges like Coinbase and Binance announced that they will be suspending all ETH and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals, in order to ensure a seamless transition.</p>
          <p>It is possible that the whales moved their holdings onto exchanges to either preemptively dump their holdings in anticipation of a price slump after the Merge. The other possibility is them waiting till well after the Merge to act on ETH’s price action.</p>
          <p>Let’s now look at what well-known platforms and analysts have to say about where they believe Ethereum will be in 2025 and 2030.</p>
          <h3>Ethereum Price Prediction 2025</h3>
          <p>According to Changelly, the least expected price of ETH in 2025 is $4,204.12, while the maximum possible price is $5,063.95. The average expected trading cost is $4,355.45.</p>
          <p>DigitalCoinPrice is even more bullish in its assessment of ETH’s future performance. It predicts that ETH will trade as low as $5,380.03 and as high as $6,601.51, with its average price being $5,918.92.</p>
          <p>However, you have to remember that the year is 2025, and a lot of these projections are based on Ethereum 2.0 launching and performing successfully. And by that, it means Ethereum has to solve its high-cost gas fees issues as well. Also, global regulatory and legislative frameworks have not yet consistently backed cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <p>However, even though newer and more environmentally friendly technologies have been developed, analysts frequently claim that Ethereum’s “first mover advantage” has positioned it for long-term success, despite new competition. The price predictions seem conceivable because, in addition to its projected update, Ethereum is anticipated to be used more frequently than ever before in the development of DApps.</p>
          <h3>Ethereum Price Prediction 2030</h3>
          <p>Changelly also argued that the price of ETH in 2030 has been estimated by cryptocurrency specialists after years of price monitoring. It will be traded for a minimum of $24,867.82 and a maximum of $30,483.23. So, on average, you can anticipate that in 2030, the price of ETH will be roughly $25,593.23.</p>
          <p>DigitalCoinPrice is, however, not as bullish in its 2030 prediction for ETH. It predicts that the minimum and maximum prices of ETH in 2030 will be $17,805.72 and $19,116.90. On average, it will be traded at $18,729.30.</p>
          <p>Long-term Ethereum price estimates can be a useful tool for analyzing the market and learning how key platforms anticipate that future developments like the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will affect pricing.</p>
          <p>Crypto-Rating, for instance, predicts that by 2030, Ethereum’s value will likely exceed $100,000.</p>
          <p>Both Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead and deVEre Group founder Nigel Green also predict that during the next ten years, the price of ETH will hit $100,000.</p>
          <p>Sounds like too much? Well, the functional capabilities of the network, such as interoperability, security, and transaction speed, will radically change as a result of Ethereum 2.0. Should these and other related reforms be successfully implemented, opinion on ETH will change from being slightly favorable to strongly bullish. This will provide Ethereum the chance to entirely rewrite the rules of the cryptocurrency game.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>A potential concern is the prospect of a price impact when Ether’s short-term and long-term trends appear to be biassed in favor of the bulls from an on-chain viewpoint.</p>
          <p>According to the most current data from Santiment, the majority of Ethereum whale cohorts have increased their ETH accumulation in recent weeks. For instance, in March, the amount of Ether owned by addresses with a balance of 1,000 to 10,000 ETH</p>
          <p>Another potential worry on investors’ concerns is the prospect of a price impact when validators are finally free to return their 32 ETH deposits following the conclusion of the Shapella hard fork. How many of the 16 million ETH that is currently staked on the Beacon Chain will be sold on the open market is unknown.</p>
          <p>A compelling argument in favor of transitioning to liquid staking platforms is the capability to use liquid staking derivatives on other decentralized finance networks without sacrificing staking reward.</p>
          <p>While some of these investors have invested in rival tokens in order to profit, others are doing it out of precaution in order to hedge their portfolios. This has been corroborated by the volatility witnessed in metrics like daily active users and price action of so-called Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc. in the run up to the merge event which is less than a month away.</p>
          <p>The majority of investors anticipated that Ethereum would bottom out at $3500 early this year, but the currency moved lower to show them incorrect. In fact, ETH briefly fell below the terrifying $1000 threshold.</p>
          <p>However, the coin has always rebounded when it appeared that it was poised to strike the target once more, restoring confidence in its future. This includes the incident in November 2022 when an FTX hacker allegedly dumped over 30,000 ETH. Hope is offered by the token’s persistence in the wake of the FTX bankruptcy and the protracted crypto cold.</p>
          <p>There is broad hope that the first smart contract blockchain will survive this period of trials, despite Ethereum’s rivalries and other factors contributing to its continuous instability.</p>
          <p>As far as the Merge is concerned, it is being hailed as a major success story by the Ethereum community. Buterin cited a research study by an Ethereum researcher, Justin Drake, that suggests that the “merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%.”</p>
          <p>It also reduces the time to mine one block of ETH from 13 seconds to 12 seconds. The Merge marks 55% completion of Ethereum’s journey toward greater scalability and sustainability.</p>
          <p>The likelihood that Ether will experience a price surge of 50% in the future is increased by its superior interim fundamentals to those of Bitcoin. To begin with, Ether’s annual supply rate plummeted in October 2022, in part because of a fee-burning mechanism known as EIP-1559 that takes a certain amount of ETH out of perpetual circulation anytime an on-chain transaction takes place.</p>
          <p>Concerns about censorship on the Ethereum ecosystem have also emerged post the Merge. Around half of the Ethereum blocks are Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)-compliant as MEV-Boost got implemented. As Ethereum has upgraded to a PoS consensus, MEV-Boost has been enabled to a more representative distribution of block proposers, rather than a small group of miners under PoW. This development raises a concern about censorship under the force of OFAC.</p>
          <p>It is interesting to note that while many eagerly waited for Ethereum’s Merge and beefed up their holdings in anticipation of a price surge, there was a group of investors who weren’t confident in the Merge’s successful rollout. These investors were betting on a glitch in the rollout process, hoping that the update runs into trouble. While some of these investors have started investing in rival tokens in order to profit, others are doing it out of precaution in order to hedge their portfolios. This was corroborated by the volatility witnessed in metrics like daily active users and price action of so-called Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, Cardano etc. in the run up to the Merge.</p>
          <p>The majority of Ethereum price forecasts indicate that ETH can anticipate tremendous growth over the ensuing years.</p>
          <p>As per Santiment, Ethereum’s active addresses have sunk to 4-month lows with weak hands continuing to drop post-Merge and disinterest at a high as prices have stagnated.</p>
          <p>What about the flippening then? Is it possible that the altcoin might pass Bitcoin on the charts in the future? Well, that is possible. In fact, according to BlockchainCenter, ETH has already surpassed BTC on a few key metrics.</p>
          <p>Consider Transaction Counts and Total Transaction Fees, for instance. On both counts, ETH is ahead of BTC.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, the traditional definition of a ‘flippening’ relates to the market cap of cryptos flipping.</p>
          <p>However, remember that a lot can change over these years, especially in a highly volatile market like cryptocurrency. Leading analysts’ projections may vary, but even the most conservative one’s might cause respectable profits for anyone choosing to invest in Ethereum. As far as the F&G Index is concerned, ETH shows ‘neutral’ market sentiment for the moment.</p>

            <p>The last 7 days saw LINK hike by over 15%. Does this mean its uptrend is finally here to stay?</p>
            <p>Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts on blockchain platforms to real-world data. The network enables smart contracts to access off-chain resources, such as data from APIs and web pages, which makes it possible for them to interact with the real world. </p>	
            <p>Chainlink is used by a wide range of decentralized applications and platforms, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, prediction markets, and gaming dApps. LINK’s popularity has been driven by its use case as a decentralized oracle solution, providing reliable and tamper-proof external data feeds to smart contracts.</p>	
            <p>The value of LINK is largely determined by the use cases of the decentralized oracle network. The more nodes that secure the network, the higher the demand for LINK tokens. With a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, the token has seen tremendous growth since its launch in 2017. In fact, it rose from an average of $0.50 to its all-time high of $52.88 on May 10, 2021.</p>
          <p>In late 2020, LINK’s price noted a significant bull run, hitting an all-time high of over $20 in December of that year. This was driven in part by the overall bull market in the cryptocurrency space, as well as a strong demand for LINK as a utility token on the Chainlink network. Since then, the price of LINK has come down somewhat, but it has remained relatively stable and continues to be a popular investment asset.</p>
          <p>One reason for LINK’s relatively strong performance may be its strong adoption in the cryptocurrency space. The Chainlink network has gained significant traction among developers and users, and it has a number of high-profile partnerships and collaborations. Additionally, LINK has a strong development team and is backed by a number of well-respected investors, which adds to its credibility and appeal.</p>
          <p>On 10 November, Chainlink started offering proof of reserve services for troubled crypto exchanges. This feature was launched back in 2020 but has started to gain popularity in the wake of the current unrest in the industry.</p>
          <p>Apart from the staking upgrade, Chainlink announced various partnerships over the last week that will increase its adoption. The company announced on 24 October that prices in the Bitizen wallet will be powered by Chainlink price feeds following its integration into Polygon mainnet.</p>
          <p>Chainlink also revealed a channel partnership with Tokenomia.pro, a web3 consultancy firm catering to token engineering and smart contract design, among other things.</p>
          <p>Chainlink also announced a partnership with international banking network SWIFT, which came as much-needed positive news for its stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Speaking at SmartCon22, Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov unveiled plans to launch staking at the end of 2022, in addition to a new economic model for the Web3 services platform.</p>
          <p>On 29 September, SWIFT, the international banking network, announced a collaboration with Chainlink in order to develop a cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) in an initial proof-of-concept (PoC). This move will pave the way for the institutional adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p>
          <p>According to Chainlink’s official website, the transaction value enabled by the network so far is a whopping $7.2 trillion.</p>
          <p>Back in 2014, SmartContract.com set out to develop a bridge between external data sources and public blockchains. Ironically, this led to the creation of a centralized oracle system called Chainlink. In 2017, this product was reshaped into what we now know as the Chainlink Network.</p>
          <p>Chainlink is the largest oracle project in terms of market cap and total value secured, and a number of crypto-projects associated with it. An oracle is basically software that acts as an intermediary between the on-chain and the real world.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Chainlink provides a lot of use cases. Users of Chainlink can operate nodes and make money by managing the blockchain’s infrastructure. The Price Feed Oracle Networks are powered by a number of node operators. The platform integrates more than 100 projects with 700 Oracle networks, giving it access to over a billion data points and protecting over $75 billion.</p>
          <p>So, what does this movement mean, and is now a good time to get into LINK? This article will talk about the altcoin ranked twenty-fourth by market capitalization. In fact, it will also touch upon what are the key factors to consider when making a decision on buying into LINK.</p>
          <p>Here’s a fun fact from Defi Llama – Chainlink is securing more value than all of its competitors combined. The network has secured more than $14 billion from protocols that rely on its data feeds.</p>
          <p>In May 2021, Sergey Nazarov, Co-founder, and CEO of Chainlink disclosed in a podcast that Chainlink is estimated to have 60% of the market share.</p>
          <p>A monopoly like this has its cons. For instance, during the Terra collapse, Chainlink caused an $11.2 million loss to the Venus protocol. This was when the latter was unable to access accurate data from Chainlink’s price feed.</p>
          <p>In fact, the Chainlink ecosystem boasts some big names like VISA, SWIFT, Google Cloud, etc.</p>
          <p>It’s important to note that most of the LINK in circulation is being used for speculation rather than rewarding node operators. This, as expected, raises eyebrows among value investors.</p>
          <p>Some believe that Chainlink is creating economic value in the industry by catering to a number of crypto-projects. Alas, that value doesn’t seem to reflect on their native token’s price.</p>
          <p>Even so, following Chainlink’s 7 June proposal of the staking update, LINK surged by nearly 20% from $7 all the way up to $9.</p>
          <p>The proposed staking update is much anticipated in the crypto space. The update will be beneficial for the token’s value as oracles will be required to stake LINK. This update will also enable community participation, leading to enhanced overall security.</p>
          <p>Nazarov clarified that Chainlink does not produce blocks, but “make consensus on hundreds of oracle networks about price data.” He further added that the developer’s team is finally satisfied with the security and scalability of the consensus mechanism and ready to launch staking this year.</p>
          <p>The update will also bring additional utility to LINK, beyond facilitating payments to node operators.</p>
          <p>Chainlink developers estimate that the proposed staking will yield 5% annually thanks to proceeds from Chainlink’s data feed users and emissions from the treasury reserve. The goal is for treasury emissions to end once Chainlink’s usage grows, leaving all staking rewards to come from fees paid by oracle users.</p>
          <p>While speaking at NFT.NYC 2022, Lauren Halstead from Chainlink Labs outlined the spectrum of Chainlink’s use cases using the example of dynamic NFTs. Halstead demonstrated how dynamic NFTs can be updated in real-time with the help of off-chain data gathered by Chainlink.</p>
          <p>Interest Protocol, the first fractional reserve banking protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, announced earlier this month that it had entered into a strategic partnership with Chainlink. Chainlink will help Interest Protocol integrate two of its features, namely Chainlink Keepers and Chainlink Proof of Reserve.</p>
          <p>On 15 August, Floki Inu announced that they had integrated two products from Chainlink’s suite with their newly launched FlokiFi Locker on BNB Chain and the Ethereum mainnet. In an interview with BSC news, a core team member of Floki said,</p>
          <p><strong>“We feel excited to be working with Chainlink to enhance the integrity of the FlokiFi Locker protocol. Chainlink is by far the biggest decentralized oracle solution in the world as well as the best and most reliable.”</strong></p>
          <p>On 28 August, Chainlink informed its community on Reddit that the Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) was being used by more than 350 projects across Avalanche, Ethereum, Fantom, and Polygon, as a source of provably fair randomness for their NFTS, dApps etc. Chainlink VRF is the industry-leading random number generator (RNG) solution for an off-chain solution and smart contracts.</p>
          <p>Data from whalestats revealed that LINK is the most widely held token among top Ethereum whales. This information is derived from the data collected from the wallets of the top 5000 Ethereum whales.</p>
          <p>According to a report published by Fortune Business Insights, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 26.4% annually between 2022 and 2029. Given the rising adoption of blockchain technology in mainstream businesses like banking, logistics ets, we can expect a similar growth rate in cryptocurrencies that enhance IoT-based businesses. Chainlink would be an appropriate example of this.</p>
          <h3>LINK Price Analysis</h3>
          <p>At press time, LINK was trading at $8.57, hiking by 16.5% in the last 7 days. Moreover, LINK had a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, with the crypto ranked 21st on the crypto-rankings chart.</p>
          <p>The month of August 2022 saw Chainlink closing in on double-digit territory when it set a two-month high of $9.52, before falling to prices that rendered the monthly return negative. This is pretty volatile, compared to the rather calm sideways movement witnessed by LINK’s price in July.</p>
          <p>Even with all the volatility, the overall theme for August can be summed up with one word: Bearish.</p>
          <p>September, however, was bullish, with October seeing bits of both. As far as November and December are concerned, the less said, the better.</p>
          <p>While 2023 began on a positive note, its fortunes were reversed in mid-February. LINK’s most recent downtrend has been fueled by the macroeconomic headwinds faced by the crypto-market at large. It has recovered since, however, and this has been fueled by how ETH and BTC have been doing.</p>
          <h3>Chainlink’s critics</h3>
          <p>Eric Wall from Arcane Assets has been rather critical of Chainlink’s activities. In May 2021, he stated that the network is not “crypto-economically secure,” citing the developer’s state and the fact that the model relies on a trusted system.</p>
          <p>Zeus Capital has been a vocal critic of Chainlink since 2020 when they published a fifty-nine-page investigative report. One outlining how the network is a fraud, going as far as calling it the “wirecard of crypto.”</p>
          <p>CryptoWhale turned up the heat on Chainlink developers in a series of tweets too. It accused the team of running a pump-and-dump scheme. These allegations came following a $1.5 billion LINK sell-off allegedly by Chainlink insiders and developers in June 2021.</p>
          <h3>LINK Tokenomics</h3>
          <p>One billion LINK tokens were pre-mined in 2017, following which Chainlink raised $32 million through an initial coin offering (ICO). Thirty percent went to the founders and the project. Thirty-five percent accounted for airdrops and rewards for node operators. The remaining thirty-five percent went towards issuing to investors.</p>
          <p>According to Etherscan, the top hundred wallets hold roughly 75% of LINK supply. This doesn’t look so good for a token that’s supposed to be decentralized. Chainlink’s supporters have, however, argued that a certain degree of centralization will help developers to effectively respond to network-threatening events.</p>
          <p>Data from Etherscan also revealed Chainlink developers’ addresses consistently dumping their holdings on Binance, something that hasn’t been received well by the community.</p>
          <p>One would think that this works out well in favor of decentralization, but most of those tokens have been bought up by whales.</p>
          <p>A number of analysts believe that the performance of LINK and ETH is correlated to some extent.</p>
          <p>Chainlink’s growth is inherently tied to the growth of smart contracts and blockchain services. Increased adoption of smart contracts translates to an increase in demand for data feeds from oracles.</p>
          <p>Chainlink’s utility has attracted cross-chain ventures. Non-Ethereum-based protocols like Polkadot and Solana are building integrations with Chainlink for access to its oracle network.</p>
          <h3>Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction 2025</h3>
          <p>Experts at Changelly concluded from their analysis of LINK’s previous price action that in 2025, the crypto should be worth at least $26.64. The maximum price for LINK, according to them, would be $32.01. Considering its press time price, that would yield a whopping 312% profit.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, Finder’s panel of experts has projected a median value of $40 for LINK by December 2025.</p>
          <p>Ethereum merging its mainnet and Beacon Chain is expected to affect LINK’s price action, too. In fact, it has also been demonstrated that there’s some correlation between ETH and LINK. ETH rose above $4000 and LINK broke the $50-mark to reach its all-time high last year.</p>
          <p>Talking in the context of the Mainnet merge, if ETH should break the $ 10,000 level, then it is likely that LINK will follow suit and touch $100.</p>
          <p>In light of new business partnerships, API connection improvements, and Chainlink’s customized services, there are also projections that place a maximum price of $45.75 on LINK by 2025.</p>
          <h3>Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction 2030</h3>
          <p>Changelly’s crypto experts have estimated that in 2030, LINK will be trading for at least $182.88, possibly peaking out at $221.4. That would mean a return of 2650%.</p>
          <p>Joseph Raczynski, the technologist, and futurist at Thomson Reuters and one of the panelists for Finder, has a rather positive outlook on LINK’s future. He sees the coin worth $100 in 2025 and $500 by 2030.</p>
          <p><strong>“Link is pushing the boundary on one of the most important aspects of blockchain technology — connections to other blockchains, databases and ecosystems. Chainlink could be the highway among blockchains, which is a huge key for the industry.”</strong></p>
          <p>Justin Chuh, the Senior Trader at Wave Financial, made his own projections for the future of LINK too. He sees the coin at $50 in 2025 and $100 in 2030.</p>
          <p>Forrest Przybysz, the Senior Cryptocurrency Investment Analyst at Token Metrics, shared his immensely bullish stance on the token’s future value and projected LINK to be worth $500 by 2025 and $2500 by the end of 2030.</p>
          <p>He added,</p>
          <p><strong>“LINK has one of the fastest, smoothest growth curves of any cryptocurrency and has a major lead in terms of its competition.”</strong></p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Chainlink had previously clarified that it would continue operating on the Ethereum blockchain following the Merge to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus layer scheduled for next month, rubbishing claims of any association with forked versions of the Ethereum blockchain, including proof-of-work forks.</p>
          <p>The major factors that will influence LINK’s price in the coming years are,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Timely implementation of Staking update</li>
            <li>Increased Adoption of WEB 3.0</li>
            <li>Partnerships with established businesses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Launched in 2017, Chainlink is fairly new to the industry and its full potential is yet to be determined. On-chain metrics suggest that users are confident about the future of LINK.</p>
          <p>While it is true that the service provided by Chainlink pertains to a specific niche, one cannot deny the relevance of said niche and its importance in the future. Oracles essentially cater to all blockchains that utilize smart contracts, making the services of platforms like Chainlink vital for their operations. Companies from both traditional backgrounds and from the crypto space agree that smart contracts hold considerable significance, significance that will only grow in the future.</p>
          <p>From an investment point of view, one might compare Chainlink and its token to how a traditional company and its shares function. If the company has a healthy balance sheet and has a meaningful contribution to the economy, then its shares are bound to perform well. The same can be said for Chainlink, because they are the leaders of their sector and their services are essential to several projects, both now and in the future.</p>
          <p>The above analogy would not hold true for even a third of the thousands of crypto projects that exist today.</p>
          <p>As far as the Fear and Greed Index is concerned, it flashed signs of ‘Neutral.’</p>

        content: <div className="blog-content">
            <p>After a promising start, SHIB is stuck within a price range. Here’s what can spur its fortunes…</p>
            <p>The crypto-markets began trading on a gloomy note on 18 April as Bitcoin was unable to break through its resistance level of $30,400. When Bitcoin’s price dropped to $29,700, briefly, several altcoins and meme tokens followed. Shiba Inu (SHIB), like many others, dropped on the charts too, before recovering somewhat and falling again finally.</p>	
          <p>Shiba Inu project’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently updated his Twitter location to “in the Lab,” prompting the crypto-community to speculate about Shibarium’s progress.</p>	
          <p>The recent release of Shibarium beta’s public documentation and ongoing project developments demonstrate Shiba Inu’s strong commitment to expanding their ecosystem and improving the platform’s capabilities. The price of SHIB, on the other hand, remains sideways as market sentiment remains uncertain.</p>	
          <p>There is mild but consistent growth in the total number of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens being burnt as the price of the meme coin takes a breather. Over 5.2 million SHIB tokens have been burnt over the last 24 hours. In fact, Shiba Inu has been on a rampage for the better part of the week.</p>	
          <p>Consider this – Shiba Inu (SHIB) reportedly noted its highest daily surge in active addresses in 2023 at the end of March, when nearly 36,000 SHIB addresses transacted on the network. Citing Santiment data, crypto-analyst Ali Martinez made the claim on Twitter that the network activity has set a record high since the beginning of the year.</p>	
          <p>Despite the launch of the much-awaited Shibarium L2,  however, whale trading activity has continued to decline.</p>	
          <p>Shytoshi Kusama had previously promised that Shibarium would not only serve as a Layer 2 platform for Shiba Inu ecosystem members, but would also attract members of the broader crypto-community. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Shibarium is expected to bring a lot of attention to meme coins.</p>	
          <p>SHIB took a massive hit in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. The token tumbled down the price chart but has been trying to recover.</p>	
          <p>That being said, the arrival of Shibarium might potentially mark a new era for Shiba Inu. One in which it moves from being just a meme cryptocurrency to being a platform that offered genuine utility. Just last week, the project announced the public beta launch of Shibarium, a launch that is expected to push SHIB’s price in the future.</p>	
          <p>Shiba Inu was founded in 2020 by an anonymous techpreneur. Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin, both tech billionaires, have praised the project. Shiba Inu has been successful in attracting people who missed the Dogecoin craze previously.</p>	
          <p>Investors seeking to join the joke have increased the popularity of memecoins, which are not supposed to be taken seriously.</p>	
          <p>Shiba Inu has been known to be a disrupter when it comes to management and operations. The enterprise began with a supply of one quadrillion; its founder Ryoshi first locked 50% in Uniswap and then burned another 50% to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. We are yet to know why this step was taken.</p>	
          <p>Later in 2021, Buterin burned 90% of his Shiba Inu holdings and donate the rest to charities. He had earlier donated SHIB tokens worth $1 billion to a COVID-19 relief fund for India, CryptoRelief. He said that this was the only way he could avoid his transactions in Shiba Inu being read as actions.</p>	
          <p>Buterin’s decision to burn his holdings, nearly 50% of the Shiba Inu coins in circulation, effectively put them outside the purview of the market since these coins are now stored on an inaccessible public address. Ryoshi thanked Buterin for his contribution to creating a decentralized financial system.</p>
          <p>Buterin has also praised the Shiba Inu community for supporting different initiatives such as the Fellows in AI Existential Safety.</p>	
          <p>The platform also supports the Shiba Inu Incubator, facilitating a large group of creative digital artists who bring forth an experience of what feels like a decentralized movement. The NFT project gives support to artists in the creation, exhibition, promotion and auction of their artworks, besides providing them with other streams of income.</p>	
          <p>In August 2022, the Shiba Inu Ecosystem announced on Twitter the name of the Shib CCG game, Shiba Eternity. It also revealed that the game would be available on both Google PlayStore and Apple AppStore. On 17 September, the game was launched in Australia and plans to venture into other countries.</p>	
          <p>The community is also involved in rescuing real Shiba Inu dogs through its association with the NGO named Shiba Inu Rescue Association.</p>	
          <p>Skeptics are unsure of the future of cryptocurrency and memecoins in particular. While the mainstream cryptocurrencies projected themselves to be the alternatives to fiat currencies, memestream cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu were only poking fun at the former’s claims.</p>	
          <p>But as these memecoins got popular, they didn’t go in the direction of developing use cases of the currency. That wasn’t the intention either, neither did the community expect such a popularity in the growth of memecoins. There are, however, a number of merchants today in the US accepting Shiba Inu as a payment method.</p>	
          <p>Another factor affecting the growth of the Shiba Inu currency is the huge number of crypto whales selling the memecoins. As per a report, whales at one point of time held $1 billion worth of SHIB coins. However, they keep selling and burning the currency from time to time, and now they hold barely a fraction of that amount.</p>	
          <p>The second quarter of 2022 proved to be a bloodbath for the entire cryptocurrency industry as Terra Luna, FTX and several crypto projects failed in the year. The banking crisis following the collapse of the crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) also impacted SHIB’s performance.</p>	
          <h3>Why these projections matter </h3>
          <p>As is evident, a sense of community is crucial to the growth of SHIB. Whether it is their demand to get it listed on Robinhood or asking McDonald’s to accept it as a mode of payment, the community has always rallied around the growth of SHIB.</p>	
          <p>It has also become home to a huge community of NFT artists who focus on the Shiba Inu breed of dogs in their artworks.</p>	
          <p>“Rather than simply dismissing the hype outright, it’s important to realize that what we’re seeing is the mass movement of traders new to crypto moving into the space,” said Ben Caselin, Head of Research and Strategy at AAX. He added, “SHIB coin is a meme coin and embraces that.”</p>	
          <p>In this article, we will give an overview of the key performance indicators of SHIB such as price and market cap. We will then share with you what most popular crypto-analysts have to say about the future of this meme coin. This information will be complemented by data charts for a better understanding of the trajectory of SHIB so far and later.</p>	
          <h3>Shiba Inu’s Price, Market Cap, and everything in between</h3>
          <p>During the crypto-bloom of 2021, SHIB’s price continued to soar and hit 0.00003503 in mid-May. Its price further rose by over 34% when it got listed on the crypto-exchange Coinbase in September 2021.</p>	
          <p>When the Shiba Inu community clamoured to get the cryptocurrency listed on Robinhood Markets Inc., its price soared to an ATH of $0.00008845 in late October 2021. The altcoin, however, was not listed on the exchange before April 2022. At that point in time, it even dislodged Dogecoin to become the most-valued meme coin by market capitalization. The surge also led to its mass adoption by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>	
          <p>As the cryptocurrency market crashed during Q2 of 2022, SHIB’s market price also continued to fall. From its April 2022 price of 0.000026, it fell to a little below $0.000008 by mid-June 2022. Since then, it hasn’t performed much better.</p>	
          <p>SHIB, at press time, was trading at $0.00001122 with a market cap of $6.7 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $377 million.</p>	
          <p>However, one cannot disregard the fact that along with DOGE, SHIB has been responsible for a flood of meme-coins in the cryptocurrency market such as Bit Shiba, King Shiba and Baby Doge.</p>	
          <h3>Shiba Inu Coin’s 2025 Predictions </h3>
          <p>Before reading further, we must understand that market predictions of different analysts widely vary. A good number of times, these predictions will prove to be wrong as analysts cannot always foresee events such as political or environmental crises. It is wise that an investor conducts their own research before investing in a cryptocurrency, especially in something as volatile as SHIB.</p>	
          <p>A Changelly blogpost says that after studying the SHIB prices and market fluctuations, experts predict that SHIB could hit as high as $0.0000440756 and as low as $0.0000366063 in 2025. Its average price is expected to remain at $0.0000376362.</p>	
          <p>Telegaon writes that according to some crypto experts, the Shiba Inu Coin price can hit a new ATH in 2025. They predict the minimum and maximum prices of SHIB this year to be $0.00009839 and $0.0001928, respectively. Its average price is predicted to be around $0.0001152.</p>	
          <p>As per DigitalCoinPrice, the minimum and maximum prices of SHIB in 2025 will be $0.0000312 and $0.0000381, with its average price remaining at $0.0000356.</p>	
          <p>Shiba Inu’s 2030 Predictions</p>	
          <p>The aforementioned Chanelly blogpost writes that SHIB could hit as high as $0.0002908409 and as low as $0.0002463454 in 2030. Its average price is expected to remain at $0.0002532547</p>	
          <p>Telegaon writes that SHIB’s price can hit as high as $0.00112 and as low as $0.0009354 in 2030. Its average price in the said year however will be $0.0009915.</p>	
          <p>The post adds that if users burn enough tokens, a cryptocurrency’s acceptance is bound to increase. But we should understand that for this purpose, it has to have different use cases.</p>	
            <p>The aforementioned DigitalCoinPrice article predicts that SHIB’s average price in 2030 will be $0.000108. Its minimum and maximum prices for the year will be $0.000103 and $0.000111.</p>	
            <p>At the time of writing, SHIB’s Fear and Greed Index was in the ‘neutral’ position.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Shiba Inu Coin has continued to grow, hand in hand with the token burns. However, as its supply decreases and demand increases, its price should rise. Ideally. In fact, many investors have become millionaires by investing in this meme coin.</p>
          <p>Shiba Inu has a lot of promising possibilities that will keep pushing the market. What also works in its favor is its extremely low price, which is why a lot of people keep buying it.</p>
          <p>Shibarium, the platform’s Layer 2 protocol, has been launched. It will allow users to move assets with minor gas fees, facilitating micro transactions over Shiba Inu-based dApps. The team has deployed a host of new and innovative developers to build the UX/UI of its platform and web portals as a part of the same process.</p>
          <p>The launch of Shibarium was accompanied by the launch of the TREAT token. It will be used as a reward token on Shiba Inu-based metaverse and games such as the Shiba Collectible Card Game. A limited supply of these coins is reserved for its most loyal Breed members who have been working for years to build public confidence in the entity. The team has also been contemplating launching SHI, a stablecoin; but no concrete information about this coin is there so far.</p>
          <p>In January 2022, Shiba Inu Ecosystem announced the arrival of Shiberse, the native metaverse of the Shiba Inu community. As digital coins, games, virtual land and memes populate the Shiberse, it is bound to get popular among an audience that is keen to explore a brave new world beyond the confines of time and space. </p>
          <p>The same month, the group tweeted the news about Shiba Eternity, a collectible card game. The game has been developed in close collaboration with the legendary AAA game development studio PlaySide Studios.</p>
          <p>What the enterprise is certain to face is a challenge in this space from Big Tech metaverse ventures such as Yuga Labs’ Otherside and Zuckerberg’s Meta. It is difficult for an independent community such as the Shiba Inu Ecosystem to sustain the might of Big Money and Big Tech. The only way it can gain an edge in this segment is by introducing revolutionary ideas in the metaverse, gaming and NFT segments. So far, we haven’t seen anything new.</p>
          <p>In October 2022, Elon Musk announced the launch of a fragrance that can be bought with SHIB, besides PayPal, Google Pay, DOGE and regular bank cards. As cryptocurrency is accepted in collaboration with BitPay payment processor, payments in SHIB are also possible.</p>
          <p>The same month, Google Cloud and Coinbase made an announcement about their relationship for Web 3.0 development initiatives. A select group of clients will also be able to pay for these services using SHIB and other cryptocurrencies. We’ll have to wait and see if the decision is implemented and if other businesses decide to follow suit.</p>
          <p>Shibarium’s launch suggests that the Shiba Inu team looks serious about being more than another memecoin, something also indicated by its long-awaited metaverse. As such, SHIB really could be one of the major coins to watch this year, with significant rallies potentially in sight.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, its upcoming Metaverse project improves this project’s allure from a tokenomics perspective. As a memecoin, the value of SHIB is driven by how bullish (and large) the Shiba Inu community is at a given point in time.</p>
          <p>Analysts speculate that SHIB cryptocurrency might retrace its recovery path as soon as it gets support from the level. However, volume change can be seen declining and under the influence of sellers. Buyers need to come forward to rescue the SHIB token from the seller’s grip.</p>
          <p>Early last month, Shiba Inu announced that it will debut its Wagmi Temple at the upcoming SXSW festival. Here, WAGMI stands for “We’re all gonna make it,” a popular phrase among fans of Shiba Inu. Meanwhile, the broader crypto community is representing their belief in the potential of Shiba Inu for growth and success.</p>

        content: <div className="blog-content">
          <p>At press time, a significant correction seemed to be underway. What does this mean for XLM now?</p>
            <p>Stellar Lumens [XLM] gained somewhat over the last seven days, on the back of the larger market’s uptrend on the charts. In fact, following the aforementioned price hike, XLM’s volume rose too, hitting a weekly high of 223.7 million recently. Even so, at the time of writing, the altcoin was on its way down, losing over 4% of its value in 2 hours alone. </p>
          <p>Curiously, it was only last week that XLM’s price surpassed $0.1 for the first time in nearly a year. Coincidentally, the additional increase last week coincided with the project’s ninth anniversary.</p>
          <p>Early this month, Brazil’s central bank launched the pilot for its experimental central bank digital currency (CBDC). The test for Brazilian CBDC, Digital Real, is taking place on the Stellar blockchain network.</p>
          <p>Soon thereafter, Pendulum announced the release of the Spacewalk bridge that connects the Polkadot infrastructure to Stellar’s blockchain so Polkadot can access fiat and stablecoin currencies. The Spacewalk bridge will allow Polkadot to access the entire infrastructure created by Stellar, especially that related to cross-border payments.</p>
          <p>The trust of large institutions in the Stellar network is a primary reason for its strong market presence.  </p>
          <p>Stellar is today one of the best platforms for facilitating faster and easier international financial transactions. It is based on a decentralized on-chain protocol. Stellar users trade in Lumens (XLM) which is the platform’s native cryptocurrency.</p>
          <p>Another important feature of Stellar is that individuals are more interested in Stellar than organizations, as it is a platform for small-amount payments. It is gaining popularity due to its simple user interface.</p>
          <p>Stellar enables real-time transactions to occur anywhere in the world in as little as five seconds. A new smart contracts platform called Soroban has released its second preview. The upgrade intends to increase platform developer friendliness, scalability, and sensibility.</p>
          <p>Last year, Ethereum transitioned from the proof-of-work (PoS) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism following the Merge. A major reason for this step was claimed to be the adoption of eco-friendly processes. In this regard, Stellar is very promising, as it has a smaller carbon footprint. Its authentication cycle is also fast, keeping energy use to a minimum.</p>
          <p>Acting as a decentralized currency exchange, Stellar helps you track all of your assets with an order book. You can sell, buy and manage all of your assets here, with XLM acting as an intermediate currency for paying transaction fees. The currency is very useful for the users because it helps you reduce transaction costs.</p>
          <p>Transactions on the Stellar platform are performed swiftly due to the ease of Lumens. The currency not only makes transactions seamless for the sender and the recipient but also ensures that transactions are secure.</p>
          <p>Jed McCaleb, Co-founder, and CTO of Stellar said in an interview with CoinMarketCap that XLM is used in a fundamental way for the network.</p>
          <p><strong>“Maybe that affects the price, maybe price is a secondary indicator of how useful the underlying protocol is in some way… But I think that the trend is there: that where price and utility can come into play.”</strong></p>
          <p>XLM is listed on a number of crypto exchanges including Binance, eToro, Huobi Global, CoinTiger, FTX, and OKEx. This shows that the currency is an increasingly accepted choice of investors now.</p>
          <p>A total of 100 billion XLMs were issued when the Stellar network was launched in 2015. In 2019, the group announced that it was burning over half of the cryptocurrency’s supply. Stellar mentions on its website that currently, there are around 50 billion XLMs in existence; 20 billion XLMs are in circulation and 30 billion XLMs are retained by the Stellar Development Foundation for project development. Nothing more will be created.</p>
          <h3>Why these projections matter</h3>
          <p>Where Stellar trumps other financial platforms is its low transaction fees, which have drawn a huge number of cryptocurrency users to it. It is one of the few blockchain networks that has been successful in collaborating with large tech corporations, such as Deloitte and IBM. Stellar, in partnership with IBM, launched a project that enables FinTech to engage in financial transactions using assets such as stablecoins.</p>
          <p>It must be noted that Stellar is one of the large corporations that are operating in the cryptocurrency market. It is one of the most centralized cryptocurrency networks active on the internet. While the Stellar network uses decentralized nodes, it doesn’t have that many validators. Such an infrastructure gives the group a lot of control over the operations and price movement of XLM.</p>
          <p>In 2016, Deloitte announced a partnership with Stellar, along with four other blockchain networks, to provide new technological capabilities to its global financial institution client base.</p>
          <p>In June 2018, Fortune reported that New York financial regulators approved Stellar Lumens to trade on the Bit exchange, the first time the state’s authorities have given it the green light.</p>
          <p>In October 2021, IBM partnered with Stellar to facilitate cross-border payments by banks. The system uses XLM as a bridge currency for transactions and it has been successful in the South Pacific region.</p>
          <p>The same year, Moneygram announced a partnership with Stellar. Its integration with Stellar facilitates the conversion of the USDC stablecoin into cash and vice versa. The facility aims to encourage the liquidity of cryptocurrencies and the integration of traditional and cryptocurrency markets.</p>
          <p>In October 2021,  Flutterwave, a global payments technology company, also announced two new remittance corridors between Europe and Africa on the Stellar network. The step is a major step in Stellar’s expansion in the global market.</p>
          <p>It also succeeded in receiving certification from the Islamic scholars of Bahrain in 2018, aiming to integrate the technology into the field of sharia-compliant financial products, reported Reuters.</p>
          <p>“We have been looking to work with companies that facilitate remittances, including in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. It’s a huge market,” said Lisa Nestor, the then-director of partnerships at Stellar. Since the Middle East and South Asian regions are key areas of growth for the group, where a lot of countries are run on a sharia-compliant system, this is a major success for Stellar.</p>
          <p>Developing economies are the focus of the Stellar network in the areas of remittances and loans. It primarily aims to target those who are still not part of the traditional banking system.</p>
          <p>In June 2022, the global platform for modern money movement, Nium, and Stellar announced a partnership to enable payouts to 190 countries. “This integration truly drives home the value that blockchain-powered cross-border payment solutions bring to the current financial system,” said Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of the Stellar Development Foundation. “At SDF, we are always working to fill up the map and connect the network to more of the globe. Together with Nium, we are thrilled to expand the reach of the Stellar network so significantly.”</p>
          <p>Another prominent feature of Stellar is that it gives power to the community to decide what project(s) the blockchain should focus on.</p>
          <p>We will now briefly give an overview of the key performance indicators of XLM, such as price and market capitalization. We will then summarize what the world’s leading crypto-analysts have to say about the future of this currency, along with its Fear & Greed Index.</p>
            <h3>XLM’s Price, Market Cap, and everything in between</h3>
          <p>XLM’s price has hiked significantly over the last few years. Back in 2018-2019, it kept falling below its previous ATH of around $0.93 (recorded in early January 2018). It was only in 2021 that its price again rose, hitting a price level of over $0.7 around mid-May. However, as the cryptocurrency market collapsed in the second quarter of 2022, XLM went into a bearish dive.</p>	
            <p>At press time, XLM was changing hands at $0.0985, with a market cap of $2.58 billion.</p>	
            <p>The market capitalization of the cryptocurrency follows its price trends throughout. In early January 2018, it was nearly $9 billion, and it skyrocketed to as high as $16.5 billion (May 2021) during the crypto-boom of 2021. In fact, it was performing fairly well in 2022 too, until the market crashed during the year’s second quarter.</p>
          <p>Stellar has seen many growth spurts over the past few years, such as when Mercado Bitcoin announced its use of the platform. In less than a year, Stellar housed almost 3 million user accounts. Since that time, however, Stellar has built a network of partners that includes Flutterwave and MoneyGram.</p>
          <h3>Lumens’ 2025 Predictions</h3>
          <p>A Changelly blogpost says that many experts have observed the prices and fluctuations of Lumens over the years and concluded that the currency could hit as high as $0.309969 and as low as $0.259974 in 2025. Its average price will remain around $0.259974 in the said year.</p>
          <p>Telegaon is very bullish in its assessment of XLM’s performance. It writes that the average price of XLM can be around $2.96 by 2025 if current growth continues. Its maximum price could be up to $3.53, while its minimum price can go down up to $1.32.</p>
          <p>As per DigitalCoinPrice, XLM’s price could reach as high as $0.36 and as low as $0.31 in 2025. Its average price in the year is going to be $0.38.</p>
          <h3>Lumens’ 2030 Predictions</h3>
          <p>The aforementioned Changelly blogpost predicts the maximum and minimum prices of XLM in 2030 to be $2.12 and $1.74 respectively. Its average price in the year will be $1.79.</p>
          <p>Telegaon remains very bullish in its assessment for 2030 as well. It writes that the currency could reach as high as $31.02 and as low as $23.31. It predicts XLM’s average price to be around $25.62.</p>
          <p>As per DigitalCoinPrice, XLM’s average price in 2030 is going to be $1.1, with its maximum and minimum prices being $1.11 and $1.04.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Stellar has, time and again, stressed its role in increasing financial inclusion across the globe. In particular, it focuses on working towards better micro-finance management. Today, it operates in association with a number of financial institutions across the globe, shaping the future of a financial system that is welcoming to cryptocurrency.</p>
          <p>Any financial institution can integrate with Stellar and avoid the hassle of building its own payment gateway. This integration connects these global players in such a way that interoperability and communication among different systems are seamless.</p>
          <p>A significant accomplishment of Stellar is the integration of the global financial system while cutting fees. Stellar has a sizable user base, which is not surprising given that it has become a crucial tool for enabling economic empowerment.</p>
          <p>The Stellar network is considered a rival to the Ripple network. While Ripple helps banks make fund transfers, Stellar helps individuals outside the banking system make fund transfers. Its simple, swift and economical process has made it very popular among users across several developed countries.</p>
          <p>These developments are certain to boost Stellar’s credibility among the users and raise the price of Lumens. Besides, XLM is one of the most eco-friendly cryptocurrencies. Its consensus model is faster than both PoS and PoW, making it the preferred choice of many investors.</p>
          <p>The unique features of Stellar such as strategic partnerships and convenience, make XLM one of the most reliable crypto investments. Its growth as a payments network will be the most important factor influencing the future of XLM.</p>
          <p>Despite being embroiled in a legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Stellar’s Lumens coin is a major cryptocurrency to wager on.</p>
          <p>In June 2022, the system upgraded Protocol 19, building payment channels and key recovery channels. Stellar is also working on the Project Jump Cannon to facilitate a robust execution environment for smart contracts.</p>
          <p>In 2022 itself, many crypto exchanges such as WhiteBIT, CoinMe, and Mercado Bitcoin enabled USD-backed stablecoin transactions, increasing the access to USDC on Stellar.</p>
          <p>Coinbase Wallet announced in November 2022 that it will no longer support the XLM token, along with BCH, ETC, XRP, effective 5 December. Coinbase cited “low usage” as a reason for delisting the four coins.</p>
          <p>The SDF has also established a $100 million fund to encourage developers to create applications for the Soroban smart contract platform. Soroban adds Turing-complete smart contracts to the Stellar blockchain, allowing developers to create new financial services rails on the network.</p>
          <p>The Stellar Community Fund (SCF) has announced that 21 projects will receive funds as part of its 11th round. The required funding for the winning projects will be given to them in XLM tokens. The grants total more than 13 million XLM for the entire round.</p>
          <p>South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, announced the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals of the Stellar network’s native token, XLM, and other assets on the network. Upbit stated that the event was caused by the need for maintenance of the Stellar network and the wallets in it.</p>
          <p>In March 2022, Stellar stated in its blog that it will launch Project Jump Cannon, an E&D venture to introduce native smart contracts for its blockchain. The same month, it also introduced the Starbridge project that would create bridges between Stellar and other blockchains, enabling interoperability.</p>
          <p>Since December 2022, the Stellar network has been working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to provide its blockchain payment solutions to those affected by the war in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>In January 2023, Stellar (XLM) announced its decision to join the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC). It is important to note that the committee is composed of a diverse group of members with backgrounds in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. As a result, Stellar’s (XLM) unique perspective on Layer 1 protocols may not carry the same weight as that of more established players in the space.</p>
          <p>If Stellar continues to adopt more of such innovations and succeeds in building a larger community, it can prove to be a significant player in the crypto market.</p>
          <p>The latest Fear & Greed Index projects a ‘neutral’ market sentiment for XLM.</p>

          <p>Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion</p>
            <p>Dogecoin had been in a steady uptrend over the past week, but the sudden drop in prices came as a surprise, and millions of dollars of long positions were caught offside.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Losses of 10% within two hours shatter the bullish structure.</li>
            <li>Capital flow was firmly directed out of the market.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Dogecoin had been in a steady uptrend over the past week. From 12 April to 18 April, DOGE bulls managed to defend the $0.08 support zone and steadily drive prices higher to reach a local high at $0.095.</p>	
            <p>This move amounted to gains of 18.2% within a week but a good chunk of them was erased within hours on Wednesday. Bitcoin would need to defend the $28.8k support in the coming hours to shore up bullish confidence.</p>	
            <h3>The swift descent had a huge volume, but can bulls hope for a recovery?</h3>
          <p>The $0.093 resistance had been a tough opponent for the buyers in recent days. Their attempts to drive the DOGE rally higher were consistently halted. The RSI hovered between the 50 and 60 values over the past three days, showing some bullish momentum.</p>
          <p>This was swiftly undone in the hours preceding press time. The CMF had been hovering around the-0.05 mark over the past 24 hours. It slumped swiftly to -0.13 before bouncing to -0.08. Overall it showed significant capital flow out of the market.</p>
          <p>The price fell below the $0.085 level but was quick to bounce to $0.0875 at press time. The ideal scenario for the bulls is a push above the $0.088 resistance level.</p>
          <h3>“$6 million rekt,” says Coinglass, with bulls being the vast majority</h3>
          <p>The sudden drop in prices came as a surprise, and millions of dollars of long positions were caught offside. Coinglass data showed $5.94 million worth of positions were long, of the $6.06 million liquidated in the four hours before press time.</p>
          <p>The fall in prices was accompanied by a massive decline of close to $50 million in Open Interest.</p>
          <p>This indicated short-term sentiment was firmly in favor of the sellers, which was made worse by the findings from the CVD. The spot CVD chart showed selling pressure has been dominant since 14 April.</p>

            <p>Ethereum dropped as much as 7% on Wednesday amid a broader crypto market sell-off as traders navigate a murky environment.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin fell almost 3% in under 30 minutes early this morning, according to Messari. Meanwhile, altcoins are taking hits too, with solana and polygon down 8% and 5%, respectively.</p>	
            <p>Although it's unclear what exactly led to the downtrend in prices, markets have been sensitive to signs of central bank tightening.</p>	
            <p>The Federal Reserve has consistently hiked rates for over a year to combat decades-high inflation, and it is widely expected to raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</p>
          <p>Overseas, consumer price index data indicated that UK inflation remains above 10%, meaning the Bank of England may need to raise interest rates further.</p>
          <p>"After last month's shock CPI reading, today's print still shows double-digit inflation," Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst at financial services firm HYCM, told Insider in a statement. "This is a sign that inflation is not yet back on track and the longed-for decline towards pre-Covid levels is not quite there."</p>
          <p>Coghlan added: "The question investors will be asking now is, where does the Bank of England go from here?"</p>
          <p>Other experts said recent inflation data did not play in the market downturn. Rather, it was a large crypto holder, commonly known as a "whale," offloading a massive position on an exchange.</p>
          <p>"It may have been caused by a whale that sold about 16,000 BTC on Binance at the market," Timothy T. Shan, COO at decentralized exchange Dexalot, told Insider. "This subsequently triggered an overall derisking amongst longs (including levered longs) across the market."</p>
          <p>Alex Altgausen, CEO at blockchain gaming startup Banksters, pointed to Binance enabling withdraws of staked ether following Ethereum's latest software upgrade.</p>
          <p>"ETH's price decrease can be attributed to the activation of ETH unstaking on Binance. After years of waiting, people are now able to unstake and sell their profits, which is contributing to the drop in price," Altgausen told Insider.</p>
          <p>Volatility has returned to the market after months of upside for digital assets.</p>
          <p>Ethereum notched an 11-month high after its highly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade, also known as "Shapella," last week. Elsewhere, bitcoin hit a 10-month record and has soared 39% in the past three months.</p>

All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained, led by Ethereum following the successful launch of the blockchain’s Shanghai hard fork on Wednesday. Asian equity markets moved higher following a rally in Wall Street on Thursday, on signs of cooling inflation in the U.S. and on strong Chinese exports data.</p>
            <h3>Fast facts</h3>	
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin moved up 2.13% in the 24 hours to US$30,756 at 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, posting a weekly gain of 10.18%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency exceeded US$30,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June 2022, and is pushing US$31,000.</li>
            <li>Ethereum strengthened 8.62% to US$2,109, trading 13.64% higher for the week, shrugging off market concern that the Shanghai hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain – which allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time – could trigger a massive withdrawal of the token and lower prices.</li>
            <li>The upgrade might make Ether staking more appealing to investors, according to Chen Zhuling, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking platform RockX, in an interview with Forkast.News on Thursday.</li>
            <li>“This upgrade actually eliminates the biggest counterparty risk. In the past, you’re basically sending your ETH into a black hole and you’re hoping that indefinite time you can get your ETH back together with the rewards.” Chen said.</li>
            <li>Cardano gained 8.12% on the day to US$0.437, and added 15.27% for the week, after Cardano Foundation launched the alpha phase of Aiken on Thursday, an open-source smart contract language and toolchain to simplify smart contract developments on the Cardano blockchain</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 3.98% in the past 24 hours to US$1.28 trillion and total trading volume over the last 24 hours moved up 30.12% to US$58.95 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.76% to 4,009.92 points in the 24 hours to 4:45 p.m. in Hong Kong, adding 0.64% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast Labs data branch, CryptoSlam.</li>
            <li>Asian equities moved higher after a strong rally in the U.S. equity markets on Thursday, as Thursday’s soft readings in the U.S. producer price index and jobless claims indicated a slowdown in inflation. China on Thursday reported a 14.8% increase in its March exports, well beyond economist projections of a 7% decline, boosting investor sentiment.</li>
            <li>China’s Shanghai Composite Index moved up 0.6% and the Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.51%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.46% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 1.2%.</li>
            <li>European bourses also gained on Friday on the rally in equities. The STOXX 600 rose 0.46% as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, and Germany’s DAX 40 gained 0.33%.</li>
            <li>Investors are awaiting a series of U.S. economic data to be released on Friday, including U.S. retail sales that dipped 0.4% in February, with some analysts projecting a 0.5% decline in March, according to financial information provider MarketWatch.</li>
            <li>The U.S. dollar index fell 0.07% to 100.94 points following soft economic readings on Thursday. The euro inched up 0.15% to US$1.10.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin rose 2.54% to US$30,769 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly gain of 9.47%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency has gained 83% so far this year as it seemed to rediscover a role as a hedge against inflation and recession and looks set to test US$31,000 as it moved within a couple of hundred dollars of that ceiling in later morning trading in Asia.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin also found support after the London Stock Exchange Group plc. on Thursday said it had partnered with GFO-X – the UK’s first regulated and centrally cleared trading venue for digital asset derivatives – to provide the country’s first trading and clearing services for Bitcoin index derivatives, according to Reuters on Friday.</li>
            <li>Ethereum jumped 9.97% to US$2,100, adding 11.66% for the week after the network’s Shanghai upgrade, which allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time. Etheruem holders have so far withdrawn around 215,000 staked Ether, while another 961,000 withdrawals are pending, according to data from Token Unlocks, which accounts for about 6% of the total staked Ether.</li>
            <li>Earlier speculation that the Shanghai upgrade may lead to a flood of selling and depress the price of the token isn’t panning out, Chen Zhuling, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking platform RockX, said in an interview on Thursday. Even if Ether are unstaked, it doesn’t necessarily mean that people are going to sell them, because they could also use it for other DeFi investments, he said.</li>
            <li>Dogecoin jumped 6.25% to US$0.0885 to hold a weekly gain of 2.79%, after multi asset trading platform eToro announced on Thursday a partnership with Elon Musk’s Twitter to enable cryptocurrency and stock trading on the world’s leading social media platform.</li>
            <li>Cardano rose 4.54% to US$0.4264, moving up 11.00% for the week.

            <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 3.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.28 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours edged down 0.05% to US$48.58 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index added 0.82% to 4,017.62 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 0.32% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by  CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed higher on Thursday after economic data pointed to a slowdown in inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.14%, the S&P 500 moved up 1.33%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.99%.</li>
            <li>U.S. PPI in March rose but at a 2.7% pace, or lower than the expected 3% to mark the smallest increase since January 2021, according to Reuters on Thursday. U.S. weekly jobless claims also pointed to a slowing economy with the figure of 239,000, higher than analysts’ expectation of 235,000, according to a Bloomberg report.</li>
            <li>Investor sentiment also got a lift from an unexpected surge in China exports in March, which jumped 14.8% from last year, well beyond the expectation of a 7% decrease, according to Reuters.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006, and analysts at the CME Group now see a 33.5% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 66.5% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 70.4% on Thursday.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.09%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.05%. The Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.02% higher.</li>

            <p>Ether’s (ETH) fresh rally above $2,000 after the successful Shanghai upgrade late Wednesday dropped bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance from an almost two-year record high, according to TradingView data.</p>
            <p>BTC’s dominance rate rose to as high as 49.06% early Wednesday, according to TradingView data, before retreating to 48.12% as ETH’s price rose. The last time the metric was around the 49% level happened in July 2021, some 21 months ago, TradingView shows.</p>	
            <p>ETH dominance, on the other hand, surged to 19.87% on Thursday, marking a one-month high.</p>	
            <p>The BTC dominance rate is the BTC market capitalization’s share of the total market cap of the cryptocurrency market. The metric is important to assess the relative strength of BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, compared to the broader crypto market, or identify periods when altcoins outperform, also known as an altcoin season. Ether dominance similarly shows the second largest cryptocurrency’s relative value to the crypto market.</p>
          <p>Ether’s improved performance has reduced bitcoin’s share of the crypto market. The shift has come after the Ethereum network’s long-awaited tech upgrade, called Shanghai or Shapella, was deployed without a hitch late Wednesday.</p>
          <p>The upgrade enabled the withdrawal of more than 17.4 million of staked tokens, worth some $35 billion, from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchain for the first time since its launch in December 2020. Its successful deployment eliminated a slight but concerning f risk that ETH investors might not be able to reclaim their tokens locked up in staking contracts..</p>
          <p>ETH rose as high as $2,023 on Thursday, gaining 5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, leading the upswing of the broader crypto prices.</p>
          <p>BTC, which also reacted positively to the upgrade, is only up 1.5% through the day, lagging behind altcoins.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin dropped 0.76% to US$30,008 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but held a weekly gain of 7.26%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has jumped over 80% since the start of the year.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin buyers ignored renewed criticism from U.S. investor Warren Buffet in a CNBC interview on Wednesday, where he called the cryptocurrency a “gambling token” without intrinsic value.</li>
            <li>Ethereum gained 1.10% to US$1,910, adding 0.79% for the week. The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain activated on Wednesday and allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time. Some analysts expect the upgrade may trigger a withdrawal of nearly US$2.3 billion worth of Ether, about 6% of the total value of staked Ether, according to a Wednesday Bloomberg report.</li>
            <li>Litecoin led the losers in the top 10, dropping 2.45% to trade at US$92.23. The token is flat for the seven-day period.</li>
            <li>XRP fell 2.06% to US$0.5041, but is still up 1.08% for the week. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a letter on Tuesday to support its case against Ripple Labs, which it has accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of XRP. The letter quoted the SEC’s case against investment adviser Commonwealth Equity Services, which involved violation of securities laws and saw the defendant’s fair notice argument rejected by the court.</li>
            <li>Solana rose 2.49% to US$24.01, up 15.51% for the week. Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, will release its first smartphone Saga on Thursday, which integrates the Solana blockchain and allows users to make on-chain transactions, manage digital assets, and access a variety of decentralized apps.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.52% in the past 24 hours to US$1.23 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 13.33% to US$48.60 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.32% to 3,992.64 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 0.48% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by  CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Wednesday after minutes of the Fed’s meeting in March resurfaced concerns about a recession, while Buffet in the same CNBC interview warned the U.S. banking system could face further stresses after the recent failures of a trio of lenders. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.11%, the S&P 500 moved 0.41% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.85%.</li>
            <li>At the meeting on March 21 and 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points and Fed officials projected the U.S. economy could enter a “mild recession” later this year. Several Fed officials considered leaving interest rates unchanged, noting the bank failures, but decided on the rate hike due to “elevated inflation.”</li>
            <li>U.S. gross domestic product is expected to rise 2.9% in the second quarter of 2023, but to drop by 0.3% in the third quarter and 0.1% in the fourth, according to data from Trading Economics.</li>
            <li>U.S. CPI released Wednesday rose 5% on year in March, down from 6% in February, and the smallest increase since May 2021. The number was lower than economists’ expectation of 5.2% and pointed to a slowing of inflation, but is still well above the Fed’s target rate of around 2%, Reuters reported on Thursday. Core CPI – excluding food and energy – moved up 5.6% on year, accelerating from February.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 29.6% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 70.4% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 66.9% on Wednesday.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.12%. The S&P 500 futures dipped 0.10%. The Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.02% lower.</li>

The $30,000 level is psychologically important because it represents where Bitcoin stood last summer before a string of business failures across the crypto industry turned a selloff into a brutal bear market.</p>

            <p>Dogecoin (DOGE) has risen from Wednesday's low of 8 cents with a 5.89% move to the upside after Twitter struck a deal with eToro to offer crypto trading.</p>
            <p>Twitter CEO Elon Musk has often touted dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies, dedicating a segment to it on an appearance on "Saturday Night Live" in 2021. Twitter also briefly changed its logo to the dogecoin logo last week to spur a rally that gained as much as 37% for some traders.</p>	
            <p>Before today's rise, the popular meme coin had slumped by 22.64% as the hype surrounding Twitter's logo change subsided.</p>	
            <p>It is currently trading at nearly 9 cents after prominent Crypto Twitter trader @TreeofAlpha tweeted a macro thesis for dogecoin.</p>
          <p>"It is becoming increasingly harder to not accumulate doge at those prices as it fully retraced the logo change, Elon will integrate eToro trading on Twitter, market is looking healthy, 4/20 is coming and the market showed how low it was willing to go on it during the peak of bear ($0.06c)," Tree of Alpha tweeted moments before another spike to the upside.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting that eToro currently does not offer dogecoin, so in the immediate future only the likes of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), BNB and IOTA will be initially available on Twitter.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin dropped 0.76% to US$30,008 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but held a weekly gain of 7.26%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has jumped over 80% since the start of the year.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin buyers ignored renewed criticism from U.S. investor Warren Buffet in a CNBC interview on Wednesday, where he called the cryptocurrency a “gambling token” without intrinsic value.</li>
            <li>Ethereum gained 1.10% to US$1,910, adding 0.79% for the week. The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain activated on Wednesday and allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time. Some analysts expect the upgrade may trigger a withdrawal of nearly US$2.3 billion worth of Ether, about 6% of the total value of staked Ether, according to a Wednesday Bloomberg report.</li>
            <li>Litecoin led the losers in the top 10, dropping 2.45% to trade at US$92.23. The token is flat for the seven-day period.</li>
            <li>XRP fell 2.06% to US$0.5041, but is still up 1.08% for the week. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a letter on Tuesday to support its case against Ripple Labs, which it has accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of XRP. The letter quoted the SEC’s case against investment adviser Commonwealth Equity Services, which involved violation of securities laws and saw the defendant’s fair notice argument rejected by the court.</li>
            <li>Solana rose 2.49% to US$24.01, up 15.51% for the week. Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, will release its first smartphone Saga on Thursday, which integrates the Solana blockchain and allows users to make on-chain transactions, manage digital assets, and access a variety of decentralized apps.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.52% in the past 24 hours to US$1.23 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 13.33% to US$48.60 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.32% to 3,992.64 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 0.48% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by  CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Wednesday after minutes of the Fed’s meeting in March resurfaced concerns about a recession, while Buffet in the same CNBC interview warned the U.S. banking system could face further stresses after the recent failures of a trio of lenders. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.11%, the S&P 500 moved 0.41% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.85%.</li>
            <li>At the meeting on March 21 and 22, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points and Fed officials projected the U.S. economy could enter a “mild recession” later this year. Several Fed officials considered leaving interest rates unchanged, noting the bank failures, but decided on the rate hike due to “elevated inflation.”</li>
            <li>U.S. gross domestic product is expected to rise 2.9% in the second quarter of 2023, but to drop by 0.3% in the third quarter and 0.1% in the fourth, according to data from Trading Economics.</li>
            <li>U.S. CPI released Wednesday rose 5% on year in March, down from 6% in February, and the smallest increase since May 2021. The number was lower than economists’ expectation of 5.2% and pointed to a slowing of inflation, but is still well above the Fed’s target rate of around 2%, Reuters reported on Thursday. Core CPI – excluding food and energy – moved up 5.6% on year, accelerating from February.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 29.6% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 70.4% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 66.9% on Wednesday.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.12%. The S&P 500 futures dipped 0.10%. The Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.02% lower.</li>

            <p>Singapore-based crypto options trading giant QCP Capital expects a deeper decline in the ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio following the impending Shapella hard fork, dubbed Shanghai upgrade.</p>
            <p>"ETH/BTC has broken through the key support level of 0.658 and can potentially head back to 0.0553, as continued and sustained spot selling pressure in thin markets for days after Shapella leads to further bearish price action on ETH," QCP Capital's market insights team told CoinDesk.</p>	
            <p>The ETH/BTC ratio has declined 13.7% this year amid lingering fears that investors will rush to liquidate coins after Shapella opens withdrawals of staked ether.</p>	
            <p>According to some analysts, the selling pressure will be distributed over several days, allowing buyers to absorb selling pressure and keep prices steady. QCP, suggests otherwise.</p>
          <p>"We fail to see what the bullish case can be for this event as those at the front of the queue [in withdrawals] are likely to sell spot, while those further back will be hedging via perps/futures if they have not already done so," QCP noted.</p>
          <p>Users cannot withdraw the entire stack of over 18 million staked ether immediately after the upgrade. However, just over 1 million ETH earned in staking rewards can be pulled out immediately. Troubled entities like crypto lender Celsius might sell its staked ether balance of 158,176 ETH to recover at least a portion of creditors' funds, according to K33 Research.</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) crossed $30,000 Tuesday, reaching the highest level for the world's largest cryptocurrency in 10 months.</p>
            <p>It briefly touched $30,301 around 2:20 AM ET Tuesday before easing later in the morning. By 8:00 AM ET, bitcoin was changing hands at $30,027, up 6.2% for the last 24 hours. The last time the digital currency was this high was June 6, 2022.</p>	
            <p>The bitcoin rally buoyed other crypto assets and companies Tuesday, including the stock of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH-USD), as well as the stocks of bitcoin mining companies Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot (RIOT).</p>	
            <p>Bitcoin still has a ways to go to reach the heights it scaled during its peak. It still trades 23% below where it stood one year ago.</p>
          <p>The rapid climb of digital currencies is one of this year's big surprises in markets after a crash in 2022 that cost investors billions as higher interest rates and inflation lowered the value and appeal of risky assets. Several crypto players filed for bankruptcy, including FTX in November. FTX's former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges that he stole billions of FTX customer funds and misled investors.</p>
          <p>"It's a bounce back from the really poor performance we saw in 2022," VettaFi research head Todd Rosenbluth told Yahoo Finance.</p>
          <p>What gave the market added momentum this year was a banking crisis in March that took down three lenders, including two that specifically served cryptocurrency customers.</p>
          <p>Since March 10, the day regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank in the second-largest bank failure of U.S. history, bitcoin has climbed $9,500 higher for a more than 30% rise. Ether (ETH-USD) is up more than 29%. According to Coinmarketcap, the total value for all crypto assets is up more than 24% during that period, as of Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. ET.</p>
          <p>Some investors chose to seek out bitcoin as a safe haven from the perceived instability of banking. Others anticipated the Fed might have to cut interest rates in response to the crisis, sparking more flows into alternative risk assets.</p>
          <p>However, the banking crisis also has significantly restrained liquidity in the crypto market according to data collected from Kaiko Research. Because investors now have less banking partners to assist in moving funds from dollars to cryptocurrencies and vice versa, analysts have argued it is much easier to manipulate bitcoin’s price with a large order.</p>
          <p>Crypto’s 2023 comeback unfolds even as Washington regulators step up their efforts to rein in the market.</p>
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued 11 enforcement actions since the beginning of January against crypto firms and individuals, while serving formal letters to Paxos, DeFi exchange Sushi, and Coinbase Global warning the agency plans to bring an enforcement action. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange.</p>
          <p>Coinbase shares have rebounded 86% year to date but are still suppressed by two thirds below their value a year ago. Marathon Digital and Riot have both more than doubled since the beginning of 2023 but still trade 60% and 45% below their price a year ago.</p>
          <p>Another regulator, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, also has sued crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly selling derivatives backed by digital assets to U.S. customers despite not being registered to do so.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin continued trading above US$30,000 in Wednesday morning trading in Asia, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies moved higher. Ethereum dipped ahead of the Shanghai hard fork as some investors expect massive withdrawals of staked Ether as Solana led the winners ahead of its first smartphone launch on Thursday. U.S. equities closed mixed on Tuesday as investors wait for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) in March, which will provide insight into inflation and the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.</p>
        <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin moved up 1.33% in the 24 hours to US$30,256 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, holding a weekly gain of 5.51%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency breached the US$30,000 mark on Tuesday and reached US$30,509 early Wednesday, the highest price since June 2022. Investors bet the U.S. CPI data on Wednesday would allow the Fed to revise its monetary tightening policies, which can hint that the end of rate hikes is around the corner, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday.</li>
        <li>Ethereum dipped 1.37% to US$1,890, trading 1.23% lower for the week. The Shanghai hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain, also known as the Shapella upgrade, will come on Wednesday (Thursday morning in Hong Kong). The hard fork includes an upgrade that allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time.</li>
        <li>Solana jumped 11.98% to US$23.44 and added 9.95% for the week. Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, is set to release its first smartphone Saga on Thursday, which has integrated the Solana blockchain, allowing users to make on-chain transactions, manage digital assets, and access a variety of decentralized apps.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 0.70% in the past 24 hours to US$1.24 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours moved up 5.10% to US$43.63 billion.</li>
        <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.27% to 3992.14 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 1.04% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast Labs data branch, CryptoSlam.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed mixed on Tuesday as investors waited for the U.S. March CPI on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.29%, the S&P 500 changed little, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.43%.</li>
        <li>Analysts expect the U.S. CPI rose 5.1% by year in March, down from 6% in February but still well above the Fed’s goal to curb inflation below 2%, according to Bloomberg on Wednesday. Some investors are no longer eyeing the possibility of another 25-basis-point rate hike in the U.S. in May, but for indicators of lower rates in the second half of 2023, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday.</li>
        <li>The U.S. employment situation summary released last Friday showed a mixed picture. While the employment rate dropped to 3.5% in March, lower than the 3.6% forecast by analysts, employers only added 236,000 nonfarm payrolls, the smallest increase since December 2020, indicating a slowdown in the economy.</li>
        <li>With the mixed information, analysts at the CME Group expect a 33.1% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 66.9% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 71.3% on Tuesday. U.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006.</li>
        <li>U.S. stock futures edged higher as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.06%. The S&P 500 futures edged up 0.05%. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.06% higher.</li>

          <p>Data on consumer prices and producer prices due this week could be the catalysts to shake Bitcoin out of its holding pattern.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin BTCUSD +2.78%  and other cryptocurrencies edged higher Monday, remaining at some of the highest levels for digital assets since last summer, as traders eye inflation data in the coming days as possible catalysts for the next leg upward.</p>
          <p>The price of Bitcoin has risen 1.5% over the past 24 hours to $28,325. The largest digital asset has been hovering around $28,000 for weeks now, spiking as high as near $29,500 amid bouts of enthusiasm—representing the highest point since the crypto crash accelerated into a brutal bear market last June. Up some 70% so far this year, Bitcoin’s rally has spurred calls for a new crypto bull market.</p>

            <li>He said that Hong Kong has the potential to become a key player in the emerging digital economy and is well-positioned to tap into the opportunities presented by Web3. He made these remarks in a blog post published Sunday on the Financial Secretary’s Office website.</li>
            <li>Despite the volatility in the cryptocurrency market, Hong Kong should not miss the opportunity to invest in Web3, Chan said.</li>
            <li>Web3 technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized finance can potentially transform various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and social governance.</li>
            <li>Chan said the next development stage would be on real-world blockchain applications and related technologies that can benefit the economy and existing business models.</li>
            <li>China banned cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, but Hong Kong has set up a new licensing regime to take effect in June. The regime may eventually extend to retail crypto trading, which has been limited in the special administrative region.</li>
            <li>The financial secretary said in January that the city will continue pushing ahead with the development of Web3 technologies to become a regional hub for the industry.</li>
            <li>Chan’s blog post precedes a busy week for the Web3 industry in the region. Hong Kong Web3 Festival, an industry gathering, is scheduled to kick off on Wednesday, and the Hong Kong Government will be hosting its two-day Digital Economy Summit from Thursday.</li>

          <p>Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 70% this year, hitting nine-month highs of over $29,000. While the sharp rally has brought the derivatives market back to life, the overall use of leverage remains muted, suggesting a low risk of "liquidations-induced" wild price swings.</p>
          <p>Liquidations refer to the forced closure of bullish long and bearish short positions in leveraged perpetual futures markets, which allow traders to open positions worth much more than the money deposited as margin. The forced closure for cash or cash equivalent happens when the trading entity fails to meet the margin shortage stemming from the market moving against its bullish or bearish bet.</p>
          <p>When the degree of leverage in the market – measured by the ratio between the dollar value locked in perpetual futures (open interest) and the cryptocurrency's market capitalization – is high, short liquidations tend to exacerbate bullish moves. That, in turn, shakes out more shorts, leading to a short squeeze. Similarly, long liquidations exacerbate bearish moves, leading to a long squeeze.</p>
          <p>Long/short squeezes were quite common during the 2021 bull run and early bear market days of 2022 when the amount of leverage outstanding relative to the size of the market was quite high and price moves would shake out billions of dollars' worth of leveraged trading positions. So far this year, the ratio has continued to drop.</p>
          <p>"High open interest relative to market cap means the market could be vulnerable to a short-squeeze or liquidation cascade, which would result in a price swing being more volatile than it otherwise would have been due to forced buying or selling, respectively," analysts at Blockware Solutions said in a weekly newsletter.</p>
          <p>"The medium-term trend of decreasing open interest/market cap has not been broken, which is reassurance that, even in the event of downward volatility, price is most likely not going to decrease to the level it was at to begin the year," the analysts added.</p>
          <p>The perpetual futures open interest to market ratio has been falling since FTX, which was once the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world and one of the preferred avenues to trade perpetual futures, went bust in early November.</p>
          <p>The ratio has stayed low despite the recent price consolidation, a sign of investors' low appetite for risk, according to Blockware Solutions.</p>
          <p>"BTC has essentially traded sideways for the past three weeks, yet, we haven’t seen a build-up in open interest. This is a signal that the market is still in a risk-off mode," Blockware's analysts noted, saying the non-expiring perpetual futures are typically in demand during periods of sideways price action, as seen ahead of FTX's implosion.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin has been locked in the narrow range of $29,000 to $27,000 since March 21, according to CoinDesk data.</p>

          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin added 1.40% to US$28,343 in the 24 hours to 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 0.57% for the week or little changed, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
            <li>The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has risen 70% so far this year and is holding its ground around US$28,000 this month even as equity markets have faced headwinds from higher interest rates to stem inflation, a series of bank failures, and signs the U.S. economy may be headed for a recession.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin could break through US$30,000 in the coming week but the caution is that a recession may be looming, said Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo.</li>
            <li>“Normally, we see risk on conditions as something that drives up the Bitcoin price. But, over the last month with the banking crisis, we’ve actually seen risk off be positive for Bitcoin. Right now, the price action is telling us the market is undecided,” said Stadelmann.</li>
            <li>Ether edged up 0.55% to US$1,859, a gain of 3.62% for the week ahead of  Wednesday’s Shanghai hardfork, also known as the Shapella upgrade, which will allow investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time.</li>
            <li>Most other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization showed moderate gains led by Dogecoin, which added 2.31% to US$0.08328 for a weekly rise of 5.30%. The meme token surged last week when Elon Musk changed Twitter’s blue bird icon to the Dogecoin dog icon, breaching US$0.10 on April 4. It then lost steam as the Twitter icon shifted back to the bird.</li>
            <li>Solana added 1.51% to US$20.33, but showed a weekly drop of 1%. Polkadot rose 1.29% to US$6.22 but similarly lost 0.87% over the past seven days.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization gained 0.95% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion. Total trading volume in the same period rose 8.19% to US$29.46 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.12% to 3,968.42 in the 24 hours to 08:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 2.34% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast Labs data branch, CryptoSlam.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.14%, S&P 500 futures moved up 0.091% and the Nasdaq-100 futures Index dropped 0.10%.</li>
            <li>The U.S. unemployment rate, released last Friday, fell to 3.5% in March compared to 3.6% in February. The U.S. saw 236,000 jobs created in March, slightly below expectations but still pointing to a strong labor market, according to TradingEconomics.</li>
            <li>However, several U.S. indicators released earlier last week pointed to a cooling economy. Job openings which fell to 9.9 million in February, the lowest since May 2021. The U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in March also signaled a possible recession, falling to 46.3%, down from 47.7% in February.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are now between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Ahead of the Federal Reserve rates meeting on May 3, analysts at the CME Group expect a 35.3% chance of no change to rates, while 64.7% expect a 25 basis-point rise, up from 44.5% on Friday.</li>
            <li>This week brings more economic indicators in the U.S. — The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer and producer prices index on Thursday, the monthly retail trade report expected on Friday, and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting expected to come out Tuesday.</li>

            <p>Cryptocurrencies are pushing higher in 2023 despite a banking crisis, rising interest rates, and a slew of new legal and regulatory headaches for the fledgling industry.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin, the largest and best-known digital currency, rose 69% in the three months ending March 31, while ether, the second-largest, was up 51%. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering near $28,000 while ether (ETH) on Wednesday climbed above $1,900 per coin, its highest level since September of last year. Both are relatively flat over the last 24 hours.</p>	 
            <p>Even Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that began as a joke, shot 30% higher Monday after Elon Musk swapped Twitter's bird icon with the Dogecoin's Shiba Inu logo. Doge forfeited some of these gains on Thursday when Twitter's logo was swapped back.</p>	
            <p>SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci told Yahoo Finance Thursday, "I would guess right now that we're through the bear market" in cryptocurrencies. "If something happens to Binance," he said, referring to a crypto exchange experiencing new legal pressure from regulators, "I think it will be a short-term hit."</p>
          <p>Skybridge had some challenges last year as some customers requested to withdraw their money. It also sold a 30% stake to crypto exchange FTX before the exchange collapsed. Total assets under management at Skybridge dropped to $1.8 billion at the end of 2022, down 50% from a year earlier and down 80% from a 2015 peak of $9.2 billion.</p>
          <p>But Scaramucci remains confident in his firm's crypto investments. "Any time that you've held bitcoin in a four-year rolling interval, so you pick the day, hold it for four years, you've outperformed every other asset class," Scaramucci said.</p>
          <p>The rapid climb of digital currencies is one of the year's big surprises in markets after a crash in 2022 cost investors billions as higher interest rates and inflation lowered the value and appeal of risky assets.</p>
          <p>Several crypto players filed for bankruptcy, including FTX in November. FTX's former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges that he stole billions of FTX customer funds and misled investors.</p>
          <p>"It's a bounce back from the really poor performance we saw in 2022," VettaFi research head Todd Rosenbluth told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.</p>
          <p>What gave the market added momentum this year, ironically, was a banking crisis in March that took down three lenders, including two that specifically served cryptocurrency customers.</p>
          <p>Some investors chose to seek out cryptocurrencies as a safe haven from the perceived instability of banking. Others anticipated the Fed might have to cut interest rates in response to the crisis, sparking more flows into alternative risk assets.</p>
          <p>Since March 10, the day regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank in the second-largest bank failure of U.S. history, bitcoin is up more than 33% and ether is up more than 26%. The total value for all crypto assets is up more than 22% during that period, as of Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.</p>
          <h3>Regulatory pressure ramps</h3>
          <p>This year's crypto comeback is unfolding even as Washington regulators step up their efforts to rein in this market.</p>
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued 11 enforcement actions since the beginning of January against crypto firms and individuals, while serving formal letters to Paxos, DeFi exchange Sushi, and Coinbase Global (COIN) warning the agency plans to bring an enforcement action. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange.</p>
          <p>Coinbase shares have rebounded 73% year to date but are still two thirds below their value a year ago.</p>
          <p>Another regulator, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, also has sued crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly selling derivatives backed by digital assets to U.S. customers despite not being registered to do so.</p>
          <p>"This industry is not in a good trust position right now with the public, with investors, with customers," CFTC commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said Wednesday at the Links NYC conference hosted by crypto firm Chainalysis.</p>
          <p>Goldsmith Romero noted that crypto firms are still grappling with issues "learned" from the collapse of FTX last November while regulators try to move fast to understand the technology. CFTC has worked enforcement cases with other agencies, "and I think you’ll probably see more of those," she added.</p>
          <h3>Liquidity dries up</h3>
          <p>Another concern for some investors is that liquidity for major cryptocurrencies has fallen to record lows. Data from research firm Kaiko shows the ease of exchange between bitcoin and ether into cash has fallen a total 50% and 41% respectively since FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11.</p>
          <p>"It makes me weary of any recent rally although bitcoin is quite close to $30K," Christopher Newhouse, a crypto derivatives trader with GSR, told Yahoo Finance.</p>
          <p>Newhouse said he worries everyday traders aren’t entering the market, citing recent sizable allocations to bitcoin and ether made by major corporate players Binance and MicroStrategy (MSTR). MicroStrategy disclosed Wednesday in an SEC filing that it purchased a little over a thousand bitcoins, raising its total BTC stash to roughly $3.9 billion, according to current market prices.</p>
          <p>"It makes me wonder whether new entrants are really entering the market and from a price perspective if this rally is sustainable or organic buying has died down," Newhouse added.</p>
          <p>But since the beginning of February, bitcoin's 50-day average has risen above the 200-day moving average, a so-called "golden cross" pattern that suggests to chart users that market sentiment has flipped from bearish to bullish.</p>

            <h3>In this article:</h3>
            <p>Solana has introduced a solution that aims to reduce on-chain storage costs for non-fungible tokens (NFT).</p>
          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>On-chain storage refers to storing data on the blockchain network, which can be a costly process. The new solution, called “state compression,” reduces the amount of on-chain storage required to store NFTs, resulting in lower costs for creators and buyers.</li>
            <li>Solana claimed in a blog post on Thursday that state compression can reduce storage costs by up to 100 times.</li>
            <li>State compression solution could become an important feature for NFT creators, who often face high costs when minting NFTs.</li>
            <li>Minting refers to the process of creating and putting NFTs on the blockchain. The process requires a certain amount of digital storage space, which can be expensive. By reducing the storage space needed, state compression can make NFT minting more affordable for creators.</li>
            <li>The Solana blockchain’s native cryptocurrency (SOL) price was little changed following the announcement and was trading at US$20.5. Meanwhile, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite, a proxy measure for the Solana NFT market, dropped 0.28%.</li>
            <li>The state compression solution comes at a time when the Solana ecosystem has taken a hit from popular NFT projects leaving the network. Degods and Y00ts recently began migrating to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively.</li>

U.S. equities closed higher Thursday despite signs of a slowing labor market and a grim global economic outlook report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
          <p>Fast facts</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin dipped 0.49% to US$28,041 in the 24 hours to 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, edging up 0.04% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token moved back into positive territory later in the morning and moved in a tight range.</li>
            <li>Ether dipped 1.90% to US$1,873, following the U.S. Treasury Department’s statement on Thursday describing DeFi services as a threat to national security. Ethereum is a primary blockchain platform that allows development of decentralized applications in DeFi, where its Ether token is used as the primary means of exchange.</li>
            <li>Ether, however, is up 4.4% on the week as the blockchain awaits next Wednesday’s Shanghai hardfork, also known as Shapella upgrade, which will allow investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time.</li>
            <li>Dogecoin fell 8% to US$0.08542 after Elon Musk switched the Twitter icon back to the traditional blue bird after replacing it with the Dogecoin dog image earlier this week. Still, the meme token is still up 15% on the week.</li>
            <li>Other tokens followed a similar price pattern, down for Friday but holding gains over seven days. Cardano’s ADA token dipped 2.32% to US$0.3834, but is up 1.85% week-to-date. Polygon’s Matic fell 2.27%, yet is up about 2% higher over the seven days.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.84% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion. Total trading volume in the same period lost 15.64% to US$37.11 billion.</li>
            <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.53% to 3,987.19 in the 24 hours to 08:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 0.65% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast Labs data branch, CryptoSlam.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed little changed to higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished flat, the S&P 500 gained 0.36%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.76%.</li>
            <li>The U.S. Labor Department on Thursday said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 228,000 in the week ended April 1, but annual revisions to the number showed applications were higher this year than expected, indicating a slowing labor market. This added to concern the U.S. economy may be headed for a recession after a raft of interest rate hikes to curb inflation.</li>
            <li>This view gained some credence from IMF’s managing director Kristalina Georgieva predicting just 3% growth in the global economy for the next five years, the lowest forecast in two decades.</li>
            <li>U.S. interest rates are now between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Ahead of the Federal Reserve rates meeting on May 3, analysts at the CME Group expect a 44.5% chance of a 25 basis-point rise, while 55.5% expect no change, up from 54.2% on Thursday.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded lower as of 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.12%, S&P 500 futures moved down 0.097% and the Nasdaq-100 futures Index dropped 0.11%. U.S. equity markets are closed Friday in observance of Good Friday.</li>

         <h3>Fast facts</h3>
         <ul>
          <li>“The U.S. average fee rate of 6.18% means Americans’ average yearly spend is likely close to US$12 billion on remittance fees. You shouldn’t have to spend money to send money,” Coinbase said in a blog post on April 3.</li>
          <li>Sending Bitcoin to another wallet costs US$1.50 per transaction on average, while an Ethereum transaction costs US$0.75, Coinbase said.</li>
          <li>Remittance through the traditional banking system takes an average of 1-10 days as it has to go through many intermediaries and functions during fixed banking hours. The average waiting time for crypto transfers is about 10 minutes, Coinbase said.</li>
          <li>Close to a billion people globally depend on remittances, either by sending or receiving them, and close to 800 million people depend on money sent by their family members living elsewhere for work, according to the United Nations.</li>
          <li>“We need our American regulators to see the true value of responsible crypto products and services and their ability to update an antiquated system,” Coinbase said.</li>

        content: <div className="blog-content">
          <p>In this article:</p>
          <p>Ethereum has gained 8% in the past 24 hours as it edges closer to the $2,000 (£1,602) mark ahead of the blockchain's Shanghai upgrade.</p>
          <p>Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, reached a high of $1,920 in the last 24 hours, a price level not seen since August 2022.</p>
          <p>The upward trajectory comes despite uncertain macroeconomic conditions caused by successive US Federal Reserve rate hikes, and turmoil in the global banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB).</p>
          <h3>What is Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade?</h3>
          <p>The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will mark Ethereum's complete transition to a proof-of-stake network, further solidifying its position within the cryptocurrency landscape as the most widely adopted layer one blockchain.</p>
          <p>Scheduled for April 12, the Shanghai upgrade, commonly known as 'Shapella', will signify the blockchain's complete shift from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) network. Proof of stake blockchains use over 99% less energy to validate than those that operate using proof of stake.</p>
          <p>This transition follows the previous 'merge' upgrade in September, and for the first time, it will allow users to withdraw their staked ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency.</p>
          <p>By moving to a proof of stake network, Ethereum will reduce its energy consumption by 99.9%, and enable users to generate passive income through staking their cryptocurrency.</p>
          <p>Staking involves earning financial rewards for contributing to the blockchain's network and supporting its functionality.</p>
          <p>The Shanghai Upgrade will allow those ether 'stakers' who lock their funds to make the network function, to withdraw their staked ETH.</p>
          <p>This is a relief to many stakers who experienced anxiety throughout the last quarter of 2022 when the price of the cryptocurrency was sent into a downward spiral after the collapse of the FTX exchange.</p>
          <h3>Today's crypto prices</h3>
          <p>The global cryptocurrency market cap today stands at $1.25tn (£860bn), a gain of 2.5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
          <p>Ethereum stands at $1,911 as of the time of writing, a gain of 8% in the past week.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is now priced at $28,531, up 5% in the past week.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin has gained 70% since beginning of the year, and according to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours most traders of the digital asset hold long positions, suggesting market sentiment is currently in favour of more upward momentum.</p>
          <p>Coinglass data showed that in the past 24 hours, across the entire cryptocurrency market, 30,188 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidations comes in at $97.95m. The majority of these liquidations were of short positions as the whole market gained in value.</p>
          <p>However, one of the most prominent losers in the past 24 hours was dogecoin (DOGE-USD).</p>
          <p>The price of dogecoin shot up yesterday after Twitter changed the logo on the social media platform's website from the iconic blue bird to an image of a Shiba Inu dog associated with the dogecoin cryptocurrency.</p>
          <p>The price of dogecoin, which is typically volatile, soared 35% in one day, however, it fell as day traders dumped the memecoin to take gains.</p>
          <p>Dogecoin now sits at $0.096 per token, a fall of 2.2% in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coingecko.</p>

          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin gained 1.36% to US$28,172 in the last 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 3.32% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency added almost 3% by mid-morning in Asia trading. Ethereum rose 3.35% to US$1,870, a weekly gain of 5.53%.</li>
            <li>Polygon’s Matic token was the biggest gainer out of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, adding 3.84% to US$1.14 for a weekly gain of 4.74%. Polygon’s y00ts NFT sale was the largest among all blockchains in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning, according to Polygon’s official Twitter handle.</li>
            <li>“Compared to this time last year, Polygon is seeing roughly 3-5x the number of unique sellers, buyers, and total transactions monthly. This is largely due to non-NFT traders now being exposed to non-fungible tokens through Starbucks rewards and Reddit Avatars,” said Yehudah Petscher, strategist at Forkast Labs’ NFT data specialist unit, Cryptoslam.</li>
            <li>Dogecoin, which surged Tuesday following Elon Musk’s move to change Twitter’s blue bird icon to the memecoin’s Shiba Inu dog image, fell back 0.89% to US$0.09523. The meme token’s value jumped 29% over the last seven days, which seems to have awakened some wallets, with Whale Alert noting one containing 1.2 million Doge activated after more than nine years dormant.</li>
            <li>The global crypto market capitalization rose 1.43% to US$1.19 trillion while the total market trade volume dipped 14% to US$42.06 billion in the last 24 hours.</li>
            <li>In the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT Index dipped 0.11% to 4,035.10 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but added 0.74% for the week. The CryptoSlam index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.</li>
            <li>From Jan. 1, 2022, to April 4, 2022, the Forkast 500 showed the market fell almost 12% and for the same period through April 4 this year, the index is down just 2%, said Petscher. “We trade in cycles so I’m curious if we really have much further to fall, or if we’ve found some sort of floor that’s supported by collectors that are here for the long haul,” he said.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.59%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.58%. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.52%.</li>
            <li>The number of job openings in the U.S. fell to 9.9 million in February, the lowest since May 2021 and below market expectations of 10.4 million, indicating a cooling economy, according to Trading Economics.</li>
            <li>The data points indicate the Fed’s battle against inflation may be working, but at the same time concern is growing that with U.S. interest rates now between 4.75% to 5%, or the highest in 17 years, the central bank may have gone too far and the world’s biggest economy could slide into a recession. Analysts at the CME Group have shifted in their view on the outcome of the Fed May 3 meeting to decide on interest rates, with a majority of analysts, about 59%, predicting no change, while 41.1% expect a 25 basis-point rise.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures traded higher of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index Futures edged up 0.098%, S&P 500 Futures gained 0.097% and the  Nasdaq-100 Futures added 0.13%.</li>

          <p>Dogecoin, the meme cryptocurrency that counts Elon Musk among its most famous supporters, soared 20% on Monday after the token's Shiba Inu mascot replaced the bird logo on Twitter's website. Meanwhile, Musk brushed off a lawsuit accusing him of running a pyramid scheme, with lawyers for the exec asking a judge to throw out the $258 billion case.</p>
          <p>The price of Dogecoin surged to $.09 as of 2:30 pm ET, up about 19%.</p>
          <p>The jump occurred as Twitter users noticed Dogecoin's distinctive Shiba Inu logo had replaced the bird icon on Twitter's website, per Decrypt's report.</p>
          <p>The surge behind the token's price also comes a few days after Musk refuted claims from dogecoin investors alleging in a new lawsuit that Musk's well-documented affinity for the meme token was part of a "pyramid scheme" to support the cryptocurrency.</p>
          <p>Musk's lawyers filed a request on Friday to dismiss the $258 billion suit, calling the claims brought forward a "fanciful work of fiction." They added that Musk's tweets about dogecoin, which include statements like "no highs, no lows, only Doge," were merely "innocuous" and "silly" remarks from the tech mogul.</p>
          <p>When Insider reached out to Twitter for comment regarding the logo change and the lawsuit, Twitter responded with a poop emoji, which Musk previously said was the new auto-response to any email sent to Twitter's press team.</p>
          <p>Musk has regularly tweeted about dogecoin for years, and first promoted it to his Twitter followers in 2019, when he said that the meme token was his "fav cryptocurrency."</p>
          <p>The coin's valued peaked around $0.74 in mid-2021, but has since spiked periodically, often on comments from Musk. Dogecoin's last big jump came late last year, with the crypto gaining around $10 billion in market value as Musk began his takeover of Twitter.</p>

          <p>In this article:</p>
          <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has fallen below $28,000 (£22,730) as regulatory action against the crypto industry intensifies and the US government announces a schedule to sell 41,490 BTC in 2023.</p>
          <p>The global cryptocurrency market cap stood at $1.21tn on Monday, a drop of 2.1%, according to Coingecko.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin fell 2.2% to $27,887.</p>
          <p>The recent price action has left bitcoin's market capitalisation at $538bn. But, bitcoin's price has risen by 67.76% so far this year.</p>
          <p>Ethereum (ETH-USD) fell 1.27% to $1,790.</p>
          <p>The Ethereum Foundation said last week that the blockchain's Shanghai hard fork, featuring an upgrade enabling investors to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, is set for 12 April.</p>
          <h3>US to sell over 41,000 bitcoin</h3>
          <p>Last month, the US government sold $216m worth of bitcoin that it had seized during a November 2021 search connected to cryptocurrency that had been stolen from the Silk Road dark web marketplace.</p>
          <p>The bitcoin sold was a portion of a 50,000 BTC haul that was seized following the arrest of James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud after the government alleged he manipulated the transaction system on Silk Road in 2012.</p>
          <p>The US government plans to sell the remaining 41,490 bitcoins in four separate portions throughout 2023, according to a court filing.</p>
          <h3>Ripple versus the SEC</h3>
          <p>XRP (XRP-USD) climbed 3.06% to $0.5192 — a 15.57% weekly increase.</p>
          <p>It is thought that Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment platform utilises XRP, will soon resolve its ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
          <p>The SEC has accused the company and its executives of violating securities regulations.</p>
          <p>SEC chair Gary Gensler asked Congress for $2.4bn in funding last Wednesday to enhance the agency's efforts in combating cryptocurrency-related malpractices.</p>
          <h3>Binance versus the CFTC</h3>
          <p>The cryptocurrency market has experienced instability due to last week's litigation from US regulators against crypto exchange Binance.</p>
          <p>Last Monday, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an enforcement action against Binance and its founder Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao.</p>
          <p>According to the CFTC, which has been investigating Binance’s business since 2021, the company failed to meet its regulatory obligations by not properly registering with the derivatives regulator.</p>
          <p>The CFTC classifies bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD) and litecoin (LTC-USD) as commodities and has accused Binance of conducting unregistered derivative trading with these digital assets.</p>
          <p>Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has also been accused of encouraging Americans to “evade compliance controls” by the US regulator.</p>
          <h3>UK banks restricting web3 firms, claims report</h3>
          <p>The UK cryptocurrency sector is finding it increasingly difficult to access banking services, with restrictions on web3 firms holding back Britain's aspiration to become a "global crypto hub", a new report has claimed.</p>
          <p>The few banks that continue to collaborate with web3 businesses are requiring more extensive documentation, with problems ranging from having applications rejected to getting buried in paperwork, according to the report by Bloomberg.</p>
          <p>Web3 firm SavingBlocks said it applied to nine banking service providers for a corporate account and was turned down by seven of them. Those that did offer services asked for "insurmountable" additional documentation.</p>
          <p>“There aren’t many options available, most traditional banks won’t offer banking services to crypto firms," Edouard Daunizeau, SavingBlocks founder and CEO, told Bloomberg.</p>
          <p>“With the recent string of events it will be even tougher, so we are now seeking licenses in France where we think it will be easier."</p>
          <p>Some web3 founders have complained to the UK government, saying that the limitations contradict prime minister Rishi Sunak's intention to prioritise financial technology innovation and establish the UK as a global crypto hub.</p>
          <p>“The UK banking reaction has been more acute than the EU one," Tom Duff-Gordon, vice president of international policy at Coinbase (COIN), told Bloomberg. He said that the European Union's efforts to create a digital asset framework make banks in other countries more open to working with crypto firms.</p>
          <p>The European parliamentary committee approved the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation in October, with the final vote set to take place this month.</p>
          <p>The UK is losing ground to the rest of Europe, according to the Bloomberg report, as data from PitchBook showed venture capital funding for UK digital asset companies has experienced a 94% decline over the past year.</p>
          <p>The EU saw a 31% increase in investments during the same period.</p>
          <h3>Equity markets</h3>
          <p>US stocks advanced on Friday, as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated signs of cooling, and a potential end to the Fed's monetary tightening cycle.</p>
          <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) increased by 1.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively.</p>

            <li>Arbitrum’s dApps observed high activity on its network.</li>
            <li>However, the overall state of Arbitrum returned to normal as the AirDrop hype died down.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Arbitrum [ARB] has been receiving a lot of attention due to its recent token AirDrop. The dApps on the Arbitrum network seem to have taken advantage of this attention as many of them observed growth after the AirDrop.</p>
          <p>Santiment’s data revealed that Stargate, a DeFi protocol operating on the Arbitrum network, experienced a significant increase in its network growth despite a 51% decrease in the value of its token STG.</p>
          <p>Another dApp that witnessed growth was GMX. According to Dapp Radar, the overall volume on the GMX protocol increased by 6.72% in the past 30 days. During this period, the number of unique active wallets on the GMX network also increased.</p>
          <p>These developments led to a 28.6% surge in the TVL of Arbitrum last week, according to data provided by L2Beats.</p>
          <h3>Still a long way to go</h3>
          <p>However, the growth of the aforementioned dApps wasn’t reflected by the Arbitrum network. According to Artemis’ data, the daily activity addresses on the network declined materially over the last few days, falling from 611,000 addresses to 167,300 addresses at press time.</p>
          <p>This decline in activity was observed despite Arbitrum offering lower transaction fees to its users, which helped them save higher amounts of ETH on each of their transactions. According to Dune Analytics’ data, Arbitrum outperformed other L2 solutions like Optimism in terms of savings provided to users.</p>
          <p>Even though there was a decline in activity on Arbitrum, there wasn’t much of an impact on the revenue that was being generated. According to Token Terminal’s data, the revenue rose by 22.7% in the last 24 hours.</p>
          <p>The number of active developers on the network spiked during this period as well. This indicated that Arbitrum was capitalizing on the renewed attention on its network to roll out new upgrades and updates on the network.</p>

            <li>The lower timeframe structure of DOGE was bearish on the charts.</li>
            <li>The support zone at $0.071 could see a minor bullish reaction.</li>

          <p>The higher timeframe price charts of Dogecoin [DOGE] showed strong bearish pressure on one of the most popular meme coins. The $0.08 region has posed stern resistance since early March, and this does not look likely to change soon.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin [BTC] could see some volatility after dropping to $26.5k on 27 March. In this scenario, a bounce for DOGE would offer short sellers a better risk-to-reward region to sell Dogecoin.</p>
          <p>There were two scenarios that short-term bears can watch out for. One is a drop beneath the $0.071 region, highlighted in cyan. This would be a strongly bearish scenario, and bears can look to short the retest of this region as resistance. They can target the zones of support at $0.068 and $0.065 to take profits. An extremely wide stop-loss can be used above the recent Monday’s swing high.</p>
          <p>The blue line at $0.0713 marked a strong lower timeframe zone of support for DOGE. The second scenario that could unfold was a bounce from this region that reached the $0.075-$0.078 area.</p>
          <p>A move into this zone can also be shorted, with a stop-loss above the $0.0805 mark. This could offer a better R: R trade and sellers can take partial profits at the support zones if they choose to.</p>
          <p>The RSI on the two-hour chart has not surfaced above neutral 50 since 24 March, which highlighted a near-term downtrend. The CMF was also at -0.10 to indicate significant capital flow out of the Dogecoin market.</p>
          <p>Dogecoin reached a swing high of $0.0764 on Monday and dropped to test the $0.0713 support level just a couple of hours later. This constituted a drop of 6.7%, and the futures traders remained sidelined or lost money.</p>
          <p>The Open Interest dove from $261 million to $243 million after this move, and Coinalyze’s data showed $1.6 million worth of long positions were liquidated in those two hours. However, the predicted funding rate was positive, which hinted at slight bullishness. Overall, the inference was bearish sentiment toward DOGE.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Ethereum outflows were on the high side but Bitcoin shied away from a similar fate.</li>
            <li>Other altcoins joined the BTC trend but investors remained wary of ETH.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the third straight week, Ethereum [ETH] investment products failed to attract the purses of digital asset investors, CoinShares’ 27 March report revealed.</p>
          <p>According to the report duly delivered by James Butterfill, the altcoin faced the same fate as that of the previous weeks, seeing a $5.2 million outflow.</p>
          <h3>ETH stuck, BTC finds an escape route</h3>
          <p>However, products linked to Bitcoin [BTC] had the opposite experience as the inflow was as high as $127.5 million. Every week, CoinShares discloses the activities with respect to crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) across several countries.</p>
          <p>But before the latest report, both Bitcoin and Ethereum were on the same page. This was largely due to the instability in the traditional finance sector.</p>
          <p>However, the trust issues with the banking sector seem to have resulted in gains for the crypto ecosystem. By and large, the overall inflow totaling $160 million was the highest since July 2022.</p>
          <p>This hike implies that the level of trust in crypto products was high at the expense of traditional institutions’ offers. CoinShares was of the same view even though it admitted that the inflows were relatively low at the beginning of the previous week. The report stated:</p>
          <p><b>“While the inflows came relatively late compared to the broader crypto market, we believe it is due to increasing fears amongst investors for stability in the traditional finance sector.”</b></p>
          <h3>Until Shanghai leaves the stage</h3>
          <p>But why has Ethereum failed to take a significant share of the input since it was the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value? Well, the long-standing investment group opined that Ethereum’s decline could be due to several factors. And like CoinShares opined last week, the Shanghai upgrade topped the list. The trading firm pointed out,</p>
          <p><b>“We believe investor jitters around the Shanghai upgrade (expected 12th April) are the most likely reason”</b></p>
          <p>The event, expected to happen in a few weeks, would set the grounds for staking withdrawals which could, in turn, result in selling pressure.</p>
          <p>Besides that, recent Ethereum developments have not necessarily resulted in a positive price action. So, it could be valid that investors are being skeptic about committing funds to products related to the altcoin.</p>
          <p>However, Bitcoin was not the only claimant with respect to improved inflow as some other altcoins joined the fray. For instance, Ripple [XRP], which outperformed several cryptocurrencies in the past week got inflows worth $1.2 million.</p>
          <p>Polygon [MATIC], and Solana [SOL] received inflows worth $1.9 million and $4.8 million respectively.</p>

            <li>The Polygon team officially deployed the zkEVM Mainnet for public use. </li>
            <li>Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin made the first transaction on the network as over 50 projects were in line to join.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Almost six months after its Public Testnet, the Polygon [MATIC] zkEVM Mainnet Beta went live on Monday 27 March. The event, which began at 10 a.m. E.T, was broadcast live on YouTube. It had in attendance Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s [ETH] co-founder. As expected, Jordin Baylina, technical lead of the Polygon Hermez zkEVM project, was also an active participant.</p>
          <p>Known to have made its primary objective to scale Ethereum, Polygon considered the zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup as a viable solution to the delays experienced on its optimistic match. The idea behind it was to use the existing smart contracts’ power to reduce transaction costs while utilizing Ethereum’s network security.</p>
          <h3>Finally, Beta is triumphant</h3>
          <p>In an exclusive press release sent to AMBCrypto, Polygon noted that the Ethereum founder would make the first transaction on the Mainnet. The project’s co-founder, Mihailo Bjelic, who seemed elated in anticipation of the development and Vitalik’s presence, said,</p>
          <p><b>“Today’s launch is an incredible milestone and the beginning of a new chapter for blockchain technology, fulfilling Ethereum’s original promise of becoming a true ‘world computer’ and creating a fairer, more egalitarian internet for all.”</b></p>
          <p>However, the ability to transact was not the only benefit that Polygon was offering. According to Baylina, the team was also open-sourcing the code. This would allow developers to collaborate and innovate within the community.</p>
          <p>When asked how Polygon could achieve the milestone less than two years after ideation, the technical lead said that it was down to the team’s dedication. Furthermore, he mentioned that the utilization of layers in the zkEVM architecture was vital to its fast execution.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Vitalik was able to make the first successful transaction on the Mainnet in a few minutes. Here, he sent an ETH equivalent of $8.62 to the last address that opened a contract on the zkEVM network.</p>
          <h3>Constraints beaten, but caution may be profitable </h3>
          <p>After the transaction, the Ethereum founder admitted that scalability was one of the project’s limitations in the early days. But with glaring delight, he commented on the success of the Polygon landmark, saying,</p>
          <p><b>“​​Millions of constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind.”</b></p>
          <p>Polygon also mentioned that over 50 web3 enterprises already showed an interest in joining the zkEVM. Some of these included Solana [SOL]-based Phantom, Etherscan, and Aavegotchi.</p>
          <p>The project had pointed out that transacting within the zkEM rollup would take only a matter of seconds. However, the web3 project also warned that users bridging Ethereum could encounter a 30 to 60 minutes’ delay in this first phase.</p>
          <p>Also, there could be vulnerabilities that could hinder the seamless processing of large deposits within this period. Polygon’s president Ryan Wyatt commented on the deployment, noting that there was more to do with the ZK expansion in the long term.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Solana [SOL] has been in muddy waters for quite some time, having been on the receiving end of criticism due to its frequent downtimes. However, new data revealed that there was a spike in the number of transactions being made on the network.</p>
          <p>Artemis’ data shows that the volume of transactions on the Solana network has hit its highest point in six months. This resulted in a 22.75% increase in its TVL over the past month, according to DeFiLlama’s data.</p>
          <p>Although the Solana network has seen high levels of activity, there has been a decline in interest in its DEXs, as evidenced by the declining volume of DEX transactions on the network.</p>
          <p>The decrease in DEX volume on the Solana network could be linked to the underperformance of DeFi protocols like Saber and Radium. Based on data from Dapp Radar, there was a 22.5% drop in the number of unique active wallets on Saber and a 33.97% decrease in the number of unique active wallets on Radium.</p>
          <h3>SOL on the metric front</h3>
          <p>On the social front, things were not going too well for Solana either. According to LunarCrush’s data, the number of social mentions and engagements for Solana fell by 64.7% and 47.11%, respectively. Along with that, the weighted sentiment for Solana also fell. This shows that the crypto community had a pessimistic outlook towards the future of Solana at press time.</p>
          <p>This negative outlook impacted the price of SOL as well, which decreased materially over the last month. Coupled with that, the volume of the SOL token fell from 1.13 billion to 271 million in the same period.</p>
          <p>However, one aspect of the Solana ecosystem that could turn things around for the protocol would be its NFT market. According to Santiment’s data, the number of NFT trades rose over the last few days. If the trend continued, it could dampen the negative sentiment against Solana and make users interested in the protocol and its token again.</p>

          <p>In this article:</p>
          <p>When El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made the controversial decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country, many people were skeptical and concerned about the potential risks.</p>
          <p>Bukele announced on Twitter that the country would purchase one Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) each day starting Nov. 18, 2022. How is that going in 2023? The latest news out of El Salvador suggests that the government's bet on cryptocurrency is paying off.</p>
          <p>According to Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya, the government has successfully repaid one of two outstanding $800 million bonds. This move is likely to allay concerns about a potential default, which had grown amid the country's adoption of Bitcoin.</p>
          <p>Zalaya announced the news via Twitter on Jan. 23, highlighting the government's commitment to meeting its debt obligations and proving the skeptics wrong. Bukele tweeted, “Well, we just paid in full 800 million dollars plus interest. But of course, almost no one is covering the story.”</p>
          <p>The government still owes $367 million plus interest on an additional bond set to mature in January 2025, but the successful repayment of the 2023 bond is a positive sign for the country's financial stability.</p>
          <p>What initially started as a largely controversial might be paying off as Bitcoin and many aspects of the blockchain-based asset market have began to rebound. Gamestop Corp.’s NFT marketplace has seen a considerable boom. Some of the top NFT projects on the platform have seen volume spikes as high as 21,446%.</p>
          <p>Similarly, leading NFT marketplace startup Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their active equity crowdfunding raise. This comes after their announcement of hitting $160 million in lifetime volume on the platform earlier this month and a host of other milestones.</p>
          <h3>Bitcoin as Legal Tender</h3>
          <p>The small Central American country made headlines in 2021. The legislation required all businesses within the country to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services, granting it the same status as traditional fiat currencies.</p>
          <p>Chivo Wallet, the wallet created by the government of El Salvador, said 2.2 million Salvadorans were onboarded just one month after Bitcoin became the country’s legal tender. To encourage adoption, every user who successfully downloaded the app immediately received $30 in Bitcoin. By early 2022, about half of Salvadorans had downloaded the app.</p>
          <p>The “Bitcoin bet” has been met with mixed reactions from international organizations and governments, with many expressing their concerns about potential risks that may arise from the use of cryptocurrency. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued a statement on El Salvador's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, cautioning against potential risks associated with such adoption.</p>
          <p>Although there have not been any significant risks thus far following El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin, they noted it’s important for authorities to be vigilant when providing government exposure to digital assets. According to the statement, crypto markets are still largely speculative and unpredictable in nature and should be approached with caution for El Salvador’s economy to be safeguarded against potential losses.</p>
          <p>The IMF also highlighted the importance of transparency when dealing with cryptocurrency transactions and emphasized that it is crucial for regulators to ensure they remain compliant with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. It advised El Salvador to develop effective regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrency use.</p>
          <p>El Salvador appears undeterred by the IMF's recommendations. In January, its congress approved a digital securities law, paving the way for the country to raise funds through the issuance of the world's first sovereign blockchain bond. The law allows for the use of blockchain technology in the issuance, trading and clearing of securities, enabling greater efficiency and transparency in the process. The additional step forward for the country could potentially attract investment from tech-savvy investors looking for new opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
          <h3>El Salvadorian Prosperity in a time of uncertainty</h3>
          <p>While the U.S. market faces uncertainty around banking and a general decline in U.S. equities, El Salvador’s bet looks to be paying off. While El Salvador began buying Bitcoin at a significant premium to the current price, they also announced a purchase of 80 Bitcoin at a price around the $19,000 mark in July of 2022. They have also committed to purchasing one Bitcoin per day, every day since November of 2022. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was below $16,000. Roughly 126 days have passed since then meaning the company is still pouring millions into the digital currency despite the controversy, much of which has been at a steep discount to its current price of over $28,000.</p>

          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, lost 3.06% to US$26,960 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap, declining 2.22% in the last seven days. Ethereum dropped 1.61% to US$1,724, after losing 0.6% on the week.</li>
            <li>BNB, the native token of the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, saw the biggest decline among top 10 cryptos. The token dropped 5.19% in the last 24 hours to US$309, after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Monday it filed a “civil enforcement action” lawsuit against Binance and its top executives for allegedly breaking trading rules.</li>
            <li>XRP was the only token among top 10 cryptos to gain in Tuesday afternoon trade in Asia, climbing 5.61% to US$0.4843, and has risen 25.47% on the week. The gains come as Ripple Labs, whose payment network is powered by XRP, expects to win a lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly selling US$1.3 billion in unregistered securities.</li>
            <li>The global crypto market capitalization dropped 1.96% to US$1.13 trillion, while the total crypto market volume gained 30.1% to US$43.42 billion in the last 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.54% to 4,004.93 on the day and declined 3.34% on the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.</li>
            <li>Asian equity markets mostly rose on Tuesday after concerns regarding a banking industry crisis eased. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.11%, South Korea’s Kospi increased 1.07% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.15%.</li>
            <li>The Shanghai Composite lost 0.19% and the Shenzhen Component Index dropped 0.72%, over concerns that Covid-19 related disruptions continue to hamper China’s economic recovery.</li>
            <li>Gold slid 0.24% to US$1,951 an ounce, after falling 1% on Monday. The precious metal remains under its one-year high of US$2,000 that it touched last week.</li>
            <li>European bourses rose for a second consecutive day. The benchmark STOXX 600 gained 0.34% and Germany’s DAX 40 advanced 0.5%.</li>
            <li>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at the opening ceremony of the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Hub Eurosystem Centre later Tuesday.</li>
            <li>London’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose 0.43% during the day, after Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the country’s financial system is resilient and has robust capital, but warned that interest rates may move higher.</li>

            <li>Decentraland dominated the social space over the weekend.</li>
            <li>MANA’s price remains in the bearish region amid chances to exit the zone.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A large part of the crypto ecosystem experienced unusual inaction in the just-ended 24- 26 March weekend.</p>
          <p>Strange because almost all other weekends in the month were filled with evident price rises. Despite the market sluggishness, Decentraland [MANA] jumped to the top of the most discussed out of the thousands of crypto projects.</p>
          <h3>Opium in the virtual land</h3>
          <p>According to Santiment, MANA’s social dominance rose sharply on 26 March. At press time, Ethereum [ETH] virtual world project maintained the hike at 0.354%.</p>
          <p>This increase implied that the Decentraland community actively participated in conversations around the token. And the depth of discussion was far above many others.</p>
          <p>However, the rise in social activity is not an inescapable condition for a positive price action or perception. This was further revealed by the weighted sentiment. The sentiment takes into account the unique social volume and measures the average subjective information about an asset.</p>
          <p>At the time of writing, MANA’s weighted sentiment was -0.388. This means that the impression that investors had towards the token was not necessarily optimistic. The MANA price decreased 1.74% in the last 24 hours, following a similar trend as most cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <p>Regardless, it did not seem that the token would go for a trend reversal anytime soon, as indicated by the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Based on the daily chart, the AO was -0.0161, at press time.</p>
          <p>This value suggested that the momentum was bearish. However, there was potential for a trend reversal with the emerging presence of green bars.</p>
          <p>In terms of volatility, the Bollinger Bands (BB) showed that MANA was contracting. And with the price evading both the upper and lower band, it meant that the token was not oversold or overbought, at the time of publication.</p>
          <h3>No accolades yet</h3>
          <p>Furthermore, the number of active addresses on the Decentrand network had significantly reduced. Active addresses show the number of unique participants that had successful transactions within a network.</p>
          <p>According to Glassnode, the last time MANA had a notable hike in this regard was 17 January. But at press time, these addresses were down to 729.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Decentrland has been somewhat quiet in this first quarter as there has been no notable development. Since this was the case, it is likely that MANA’s price action only responds to widespread crypto trends.</p>

          <h3>In this article:</h3>
          <p>Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade is upon us and for the first time, individuals who have “staked” their ETH as part of the network’s security mechanism will be able to withdraw their holdings. Will this create huge sell pressure for the second-largest cryptocurrency? Hardly.</p>
          <p>After the Shanghai upgrade (or “hard fork”), users who had locked a minimum of 32 ETH to secure an APY staking reward of 4-5% will be able to withdraw a portion of their stake immediately. But those wishing to withdraw their entire stake will need to wait one to 36 days, which dampens potential sell pressure. Furthermore, only 16% of ETH stakers are in profit, so why would they sell now?</p>
          <p>In fact, for rational investors, selling ETH now would likely make little sense. And the investor profile for ETH holders leans towards rationality and a long-term outlook. It’s arguably one of the world’s premier risk assets, and the only reasons investors are still on the sidelines may be because they don’t understand it, they fear its ferocious volatility, or they find the regulatory uncertainty to be unnerving.</p>
          <p>But the answer to the first objection also answers the second, and will go a long way toward answering the final objection. By the end, you may grok the thesis that Ether — in the crypto vernacular — isn’t just “sound money” it’s “ultrasound money.”</p>
          <p>Ethereum is a blockchain that sells block space to apps. The apps must pay for transactions using the blockchain’s native currency: ETH.</p>
          <p>The demand side of the trade relies on simple network effects, the more apps, the more users, the more demand for ETH. And this is because the Ethereum network is the oldest and most established decentralized smart contract ecosystem out there.</p>
          <p>Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were analyzed by researcher Ken Alabi in a 2017 paper. “The analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by Metcalfe’s Law, which identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes, or end users.” This means that adoption can increase the value of any given network exponentially.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, ETH is issued as compensation to independent actors who run network nodes, and this currently amounts to 671,000 ETH per year. However, thanks to a novel burn mechanism that destroys a small amount of ETH per transaction (by sending it to a wallet from which it can never be withdrawn), the supply of ETH is actually shrinking despite token issuance.</p>
          <p>Ultrasound.money is a dashboard that tracks the burn rate in real-time showing that the supply of ETH has been shrinking for months — and that’s in the middle of a raging bear market, imagine what would happen when demand picks up again. In fact, despite the bear market, transactions on Ethereum are still maintaining a solid uptrend thanks to innovations like NFTs and decentralized finance.</p>
          <p>Volatility should be ironed out slowly as the effects of network adoption take place. The more people who join the Ethereum network, the more the value of ETH increases, which leads to more adoption. As the market cap increases it will take larger and larger market movements to rock the boat, reducing the large deviations in the price.</p>
          <p>The best that crypto-bashing regulators can hope for is to slow down the pace of adoption. But there’s not much incentive for most governments to support this approach because a) crypto, on the retail side, is driven by Millennials and Generation Z, so it will be a voter issue in the coming years, and b) it will only move innovation offshore.</p>
          <p>Even as the U.S. is putting a squeeze on crypto, Dubai, Hong Kong and the U.K. are already preparing to scoop up exiled crypto companies. And even if regulators shoehorn ETH into the antiquated category of a security — so what? Anyone could buy securities in minutes using an app on a phone.</p>
          <p>The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will be followed by a more complex upgrade that will reduce fees on the Ethereum network, making it faster and even more user-friendly. The genie is well and truly out of the bottle, and investors may well find a magic carpet beckoning.</p>

          <p>Polygon [MATIC] recently witnessed a major boom in its NFT ecosystem, suggesting growth. Santiment’s chart showed that Polygon’s total NFT trade count and trade volume in USD increased considerably since 16 March 2023.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the increase in trade counts, the number of unique addresses holding NFTs have also increased.</p>
          <h3>What can fuel further growth?</h3>
          <p>Things might get even better in the coming days as y00ts, one of the most popular NFT collections on Solana [SOL], announced that it will migrate to Polygon on 27 March.</p>
          <p>As per the announcement, users will be able to directly migrate from y00ts website. Not only can holders simply migrate, but they will also be rewarded for the same. In fact, holders will be rewarded with $5 USDC per y00t listed on Magic Eden.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the official tweet mentioned that y00ts is disapproving of further development for y00ts/DeGods on SOL.</p>
          <p>The reason why this can help Polygon is that for the next 30 days, there will be no trading fees for y00ts on Magic Eden. Therefore, holders and new users can be motivated to buy or sell more, helping Polygon’s NFT ecosystem grow further.</p>
          <h3>Polygon is all set for the zkEVM launch</h3>
          <p>While y00ts will migrate to Polygon, the blockchain will be launching its much-awaited zkEVM. As the network prepares for the launch, it has started a bug bounty program.</p>
          <p>The bounty program, which will be run by Immunefi, is one of the many safeguards in place for the upcoming release of mainnet beta.</p>
          <p>This program will further help Polygon in refining its product. Well, its competitor, Ethereum’s [ETH] layer-2 solution, zkSync Era, was fully opened to the public on 25 March 2023.</p>
          <p>Beating Polygon, the zkSync Era became the first EVM with the support of zero-knowledge rollup (zk-rollup) to be launched on the mainnet.</p>
          <h3>MATIC performance was not at par</h3>
          <p>While the NFT ecosystem witnessed growth, the same was not true for MATIC, which has fallen victim to the bears. According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC’s price declined by over 8% in the last week. At press time, it was trading at $1.09 with a market capitalization of over $9.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Due to the decline, MATIC’s MVRV ratio plummeted sharply. The hype around the zkEVM launch also was not enough to give investors confidence as MATIC’s weighted sentiment remained on the negative side.</p>
          <p>The future of MATIC post-zkEVM launch remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Chainlink [LINK] has been witnessing a constant decline in its number of holders lately. Dune’s data revealed that the daily number of wallets with 1+ LINK has been on a declining trend for months. </p>
          <p>And as per Market.link, gas spent on the chain has also gone down, suggesting less usage of the Chainlink network. </p>
          <h3>Can LINK regain users? </h3>
          <p>While the number of users on the network declined, whales still preferred LINK over the rest of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <p>Consider this- LINK recently flipped Shiba Inu [SHIB] to become the most traded token among the top 500 Ethereum [ETH] whales.</p>
          <p>Additionally, LINK has also been stepping up its efforts to increase adoption, which can play a role in attracting new users to the network.</p>
          <p>One of the latest ones was the integration with SteakHut, which has equipped Chainlink Automation to support automated liquidity management.</p>
          <p>The official announcement mentioned that SteakHut decided to use Chainlink Automation to monitor the state of smart contracts and perform advanced liquidity management on-chain because it is the most reliable Web3 automation service. </p>
          <p>As per Santiment, LINK’s network growth remained relatively high, indicating that a larger number of new accounts were used to transfer the token. The velocity also followed a similar trend, which too suggested high network activity.</p>
          <p>However, negative sentiments around LINK were dominant in the market. Well, this can cause trouble for LINK since investors’ faith seems to be dwindling. </p>
          <h3>LINK is feeling the heat</h3>
          <p>Though there were signs of recovery on the network front, LINK’s price action aligned with the sellers’ interests. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of LINK dropped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours, and it was trading at $7.13, at the time of writing.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, much like network activity, LINK’s on-chain metrics gave hope for better days.</p>
          <p>For instance, LINK’s supply on exchanges declined while its supply outside of exchanges went up.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, LINK’s demand in the derivatives market also remained high, as suggested by its Binance funding rate. This might help LINK change its price trajectory in the coming days.</p>
          <h3>More selling pressure soon? </h3>
          <p>Meanwhile, LINK’s daily chart revealed that the sellers might soon increase their pressure. At press time, LINK’s Money Flow Index (MFI) was in the overbought zone. In fact, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a downtick, which was a development in the bear’s favor.</p>
          <p>However, its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon displayed a slight bullish crossover. The MACD supported EMA readings.</p>
          <p>However, the entry of selling forces in the near term can’t be ruled out. </p>

            <li>Ethereum exchange balance hit a five-year low as more holders moved their assets to self-custody options and DeFi platforms.</li>
            <li>The decline in exchange balance can be attributed to factors such as the rise of DeFi, the switch to PoS, and the downturn in the crypto market.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The beginning of the year ushered in a whirlwind of events that significantly influenced the crypto industry, with Ethereum being (ETH) no exception.</p>
          <p>The current state of affairs, including the SEC’s regulatory crackdown and potential bank runs, has undoubtedly left ETH holders feeling disillusioned. However, other factors might be responsible for the dwindling ETH exchange balance.</p>
          <h3>Ethereum exchange balance declines</h3>
          <p>In 2022, the FTX crash sent shockwaves through the crypto world, causing many holders to question the safety of keeping their assets on exchanges.</p>
          <p>The incident sparked a renewed interest in self-custody to secure crypto holdings. However, while Ethereum experienced a decrease in exchange balances in the months following the crash, this trend can be attributed to other factors beyond fear of exchange insecurity.</p>
          <h3>Ethereum exchange netflow flashes negative</h3>
          <p>According to a recent Glassnode chart from Glassnode alerts, the balance of Ethereum held on exchanges has been steadily decreasing.</p>
          <p>As of this writing, the exchange balance had reached a five-year low, hovering just above $18 million. This trend indicates that more ETH holders are opting for alternative storage methods rather than leaving their assets on exchanges.</p>
          <p>In addition, a closer examination of Ethereum’s exchange netflow reveals that the outflow of ETH from exchanges has exceeded the inflow, with few exceptions of inflow spikes.</p>
          <p>Currently, the netflow of ETH on exchanges remains negative, with outflow continuing to dominate. At the time of writing, the netflow had surpassed 11,000 ETH already, highlighting the ongoing trend of ETH holders moving their assets away from exchanges.</p>
          <h3>Possible reasons for declining exchange balance</h3>
          <p>One possible factor is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms built on the Ethereum network. Many holders have moved their funds from centralized exchanges to DeFi protocols to earn higher yields.</p>
          <p>The yields come through liquidity provision, staking, or other forms of participation in decentralized finance. Also, ETH stakes account for 15% of the coins in circulation per staking rewards.</p>
          <p>It is also possible that some holders took a more long-term investment approach by holding their assets in personal wallets. It is a means of storing value and avoiding short-term trading risks.</p>
          <p>Also, the crypto market experienced a downturn in the latter half of 2022. The downturn may have led some holders to move their assets off exchanges and into personal wallets.</p>
          <h3>Daily timeframe move and 365-day MVRV</h3>
          <p>Despite experiencing a decent price run, Ethereum (ETH) had yet to regain the price zone it dropped back in May. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,740 and had sustained losses for two consecutive days. However, ETH had maintained a support level of around $1,732 and $1,630, previously resistance levels. </p>
          <p>The 365-day Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) revealed that for most of the period being analyzed, ETH was trading below zero.</p>
          <p>However, as of this writing, the MVRV had surpassed the zero line and currently sat at 13.60%. This indicated that, on average, the holders of ETH were now profitable, given the price at which they acquired their coins.</p>

            <li>Bitcoin experienced a net outflow in the last three days; short positions may not be a good idea.</li>
            <li>Bitcoin whales demonstrate mixed reactions that explain the current stalemate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the last few days, we have seen Bitcoin [BTC] struggle to sustain its upside. Now the market is showing some bullish weakness and the bears are trying to take advantage. The next few days might bring forth a significant pullback and here’s why.</p>
          <p>Recent data suggests that Bitcoin’s failure to continue rallying past the $28,300 resistance level yielded a loss of confidence among investors. The situation was further exasperated by miner outflows which are currently at a monthly high according to the latest glassnode data.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin miner outflows are often considered a confidence indicator. This is because miners often hold on to their BTC when there are bullish expectations and sell when there are bearish expectations.</p>
          <p>It is thus not surprising that they are offloading some BTC, right after Bitcoin struggled to push beyond its current resistance level.</p>
          <h3>Will Bitcoin outflows lend favor to the bears?</h3>
          <p>The Bitcoin miner observations also align with BTC’s -$119 million net flows in the last 24 hours according to glassnode alerts. This is slightly lower than the -$190.5 million net flow on 24 March and even lower than the -$342 million net flow on 23 March.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that the net flows confirm that sell pressure has also been slowing down. In other words, Bitcoin might not necessarily be in for a strong bearish pullback this week contrary to expectations. This will, however, depend on the possibility of market events that may swiftly change the outcome.</p>
          <p>The lower net flows may explain why short sellers may not necessarily be keen on executing leveraged positions. Bitcoin’s estimated leverage ratio is currently down to its lowest level since the start of 2023. Meanwhile, funding rates have leveled out for the most part.</p>
          <p>The lack of confidence among short sellers and leverage traders reflects mixed observations with Bitcoin’s supply distribution. For example, addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC have been buying in the last three days, hence providing a cushion for the price. The same whale category currently controls 12.13% of the circulating supply.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have been selling in the last three days. The same addresses currently control 23% of the total BTC supply, hence their impact is more pronounced.</p>

            <li>Polkadot was the blockchain network with the highest development activity in the last 30 days.</li>
            <li>DOT traded within a narrow range in the last week as investors remain unsure of the coin’s next direction.</li>

          <p>Layer 0 blockchain Polkadot [DOT] has emerged as the leading blockchain network in terms of development activity in the last 30 days, new data from Santiment revealed. </p>
          <p>According to the on-chain data provider, Polkadot GitHub commits during the period under review totaled 591.47, tying with Kusama. The Ethereum [ETH] network, on the other hand, logged a development activity count of 387.67, putting it four places behind Polkadot.</p>
          <p>Development activity is an important metric as it offers insights into a crypto project’s commitment to creating a working product and the likelihood of shipping new features. In addition, a high development activity often reduces the possibility of the project being an exit scam.</p>
          <h3>DOT wading through troubled waters</h3>
          <p>Despite sharing a statistically significant positive correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], whose value jumped by 13% in the last 30 days, DOT’s value decreased by 17% during the same period. </p>
          <p>The drop in DOT’s value occurred despite the optimistic sentiment that lingered in the cryptocurrency market and investors’ increased accumulation in the face of uncertain macro factors. </p>
          <p>According to data from CoinMarketCap, the altcoin exchanged hands at $6.04 at press time.</p>
          <p>The decline in value is partly attributable to the fall in the token’s Open Interests since 17 February. According to Coinglass, DOT’s Open Interest has since fallen by 25%.</p>
          <p>When a crypto asset’s Open Interest falls, it indicates reduced trading activity, as investors may be closing their positions or taking profits. </p>
          <h3>Up or down, who knows?</h3>
          <p>An assessment of DOT’s movement on a daily chart revealed severe price volatility in the first 19 days of March. However, in the last week, investors appeared to have stayed their hands as many remain unsure of the coin’s next direction. </p>
          <p>Since 20 March, DOT’s price was at the middle line of the Bollinger Bands indicator, and remained so at press time. When the asset’s price is on the middle line of the Bollinger Bands, it indicates that the asset’s price is in a neutral position, and there is no clear trend in either direction. It is generally considered a “wait-and-see” situation for traders and investors until there is a clearer signal of where the asset’s price is heading.</p>
          <p>While DOT’s price oscillated within a narrow range in the last week, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) embarked on an uptrend. This suggested that some buying activity was underway despite the decline in RSI.</p>
          <p>However, the neutral price action indicates that the market remains uncertain about the asset’s direction.</p>

            <li>The chain ID of the Shibarium testnet was a source of significant FUD.</li>

          <p>The FUD which gripped the Shiba Inu [SHIB] ecosystem since the testnet launch of layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, could soon be a thing of the past.</p>
          <p>According to the latest update provided by a SHIB influencer, the chain ID of the Shibarium testnet, also called ‘Puppynet’, has been changed. As per a screenshot posted in the same thread, the new chain ID was 719.</p>
          <h3>Basis of the FUD</h3>
          <p>The chain ID of the Shibarium testnet became a bone of contention as soon as it was launched. A Shiba Inu discord channel member pointed out that Shibarium’s chain ID shared the same ID as the Rinia testnet blockchain.</p>
          <p>The member insinuated that Shibarium might have copied the genesis file from the Rinia testnet and changed their name to Shibarium without changing the chain ID.</p>
          <p>While Shibarium developers termed this as a coincidence, the revelation caused much furor in the SHIB community and the price of SHIB fell by more than 8%.</p>
          <p>However, after the announcement of a new chain ID, the FUD might subside. And there were strong positive signs coming from Puppyscan, the Puppynet explorer. The daily transactions on the network zoomed to 718 on 24 March, after staying lulled for the last few days.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Shibarium team was also working on the faucet update. Faucets are used to obtain the test cryptocurrency needed to interact with the testnet blockchain. The Shibarium faucet will utilize a BONE token in order to allow users and developers to perform tests on the network.</p>
          <h3>Whales are back in business?</h3>
          <p>Meanwhile, SHIB exchanged hands at $0.00001055 at the time of writing, falling by 1.21% over the previous day, per CoinMarketCap.</p>
          <p>With clarity on chain ID in place, big addresses were attracted to SHIB. As per Santiment, the supply held by large addresses as a percentage of the total supply increased over the last two days.</p>
          <p>This could be due to whales amassing SHIB in large quantities as the number of transactions transferring more than $1 million rose.</p>
          <p>However, despite the increase in transaction numbers, data from Shibburn revealed that the burn rate declined by over 92% in the last 24 hours, with a little over 1.34 million tokens removed from circulation.</p>

          <p>Despite the re-emergence of interest in profile picture NFTs  (PFPs) since the beginning of the year, Solana [SOL] has witnessed a steady decline in NFT activity. </p>
          <p>According to data from Dune Analytics, the network has seen a steep decline in its count of monthly NFT trades completed since September 2022. With 349,937 NFT trades completed on Solana this month, there has been a 63% drop from the 944,010 total NFT trades completed in January. </p>
          <p>As a result of a consistent fall in NFT trade count on Solana since the year started, the network has also experienced a drop in sales volume. With a sales volume of $35.35 million recorded so far this month, Solana has witnessed a 64% decrease from the $99.37 million registered as total NFT sales volume in January. In the last month alone, this fell by 22%. </p>

          <p>Also, leading NFT marketplace Magic Eden has seen a drop in NFT activity and a decline in its market share. For example, the weekly count of NFT transactions completed on Magic Eden has dropped by 75% since the first week of the year. </p>
          <p>Likewise, the number of active traders using the marketplace has also trended downward since the year started. Per data from Dune Analytics, this has since fallen by 31%.</p>

          <p>Thanks to the rally in the general cryptocurrency market since the year began, SOL’s value has surged by 105% on a year-to-date basis. At press time, the altcoin exchanged hands at $20.54 per SOL, data from CoinMarketCap revealed. </p>
          <p>With increased coin accumulation in the last week, SOL buyers were spotted in control of the market on a daily chart at press time.</p>

          </u>
          <p>The TRON [TRX] ecosystem shared a report on the network’s notable developments that took place over the week that went by.</p>
          <p>One of the major takeaways was the network’s increasing dominance in the stablecoin sector.  Tether [USDT], the largest stablecoin by market cap, saw its circulating supply on Tron reach a record high. At press time, it was over 44 billion, as per Tronscan.</p>
          <p>Additional data from DeFiLlama revealed that the total stablecoin market cap on the network grew by 5% over the last week to $43.57 billion.</p>
          <p>This was in stark contrast to the chain with the highest stablecoin market cap, Ethereum [ETH], which registered a weekly drop of 2.3%.</p>
          <h3>Network expands thanks to stablecoins</h3>
          <p>Tron became a go-to platform for stablecoins ever since the USD Coin [USDC] depegging episode which rattled the broader crypto market. In fact, a day after the fateful event, the stablecoin inflows into the network reached a three-month high of $1.17 billion.</p>
          <p>The remarkable growth prompted Tron founder, Justin Sun, to announce an ambitious plan of growing the stablecoin market cap to $60 billion.</p>
          <p>It became evident that stablecoin-dominated trading powered the whole network. Since the stablecoin turmoil, the revenue generated on the chain surged 70% until 24 March while the daily user base expanded by 21%.</p>
          <p>The growth in revenue propelled Tron as the second-best performing chain over the last week.</p>
          <h3>Next challenge for TRX</h3>
          <p>On the flip side, the total funds deposited on the network’s smart contracts fell significantly, sparking liquidity concerns. Since March 2022, the total value locked (TVL) dropped 3% until press time, as per DeFiLlama.</p>
          <p>Notably, this happened after the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) initiated a probe against the Tron foundation and Justin Sun over charges of unregistered sale of TRX and BTT which the regulator termed as securities.</p>
          <p>Following this, TRX’s price tumbled 13%. However, the coin recovered to its press time value of $0.06375, per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, according to Tronscan, more than 18 million TRX tokens were moved out of circulation in the last 24 hours. Adjusted against newly minted tokens, there was a net decrease in the circulating supply of TRX  by 13.4 million.</p>

          <p>Cosmos [ATOM] has depreciated by over 15%, clearing gains from the recovery in mid-March. ATOM dropped from $13.5 and was operating at the $11 price level at the time of writing. A retest of a crucial support level could offer new buying opportunities at discounted prices.</p>
          <p>At press time, Bitcoin’s [BTC] value was below $28K and could further exert selling pressure on ATOM to retest this key support level.</p>
          <h3>The $10.58 support – Can ATOM bulls prevail?</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-212-01jpg.png" alt="ncx-blogs" />
          <p>After facing price rejection at $15.5 in January, ATOM has weathered selling pressure that has seen it drop to $10.58. Bulls successfully recovered from the $10.58, but the second leg of the rally was interrupted by the obstacle at $13.5.</p>
          <p>ATOM’s retracement could set it to retest the $10.58 support, and a rebound could be likely if the bulls defend it. A pullback retest on the support could offer long positions targeting 50 EMA, 200 EMA, or $13.5.</p>
          <p>A close above $13.5 could usher ATOM into the second leg of the rally with a target of $15.5 if the bulls clear the $14.77 hurdle.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, ATOM could depreciate further to $9.57 if bulls fail to defend the $10.58 support. As such, the downswing could offer short-sellers extra shorting opportunities at $9.57 if ATOM closes below $10.58.</p>
          <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retreated from the upper ranges and fluctuated below the 50 mark, showing buying pressure declined. Similarly, the Average Directional Index (ADX) dropped, suggesting a likely further retracement or consolidation.</p>
          <h3>Funding rate was negative: development activity improved</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-212-02.png" alt="ncx-blogs" />
          <p>According to Santiment, funding rates flashed red at press time – an indication of bearish sentiment in the derivatives market. Moreover, the weighted sentiment had dropped significantly but remained positive, which could give bulls little hope.</p>
          <p>Development activity has declined since mid-March but showed signs of improvement at press time. The trend could bolster investors’ confidence and prop up ATOM’s value in the long run. Investors should track BTC’s performance to make better moves.</p>

          <p>Cardano’s [ADA] recovery continues to face challenges but has clawed back some of the gains lost after retracement from mid-February. At press time, ADA hit a price ceiling of $0.3876, and bears seemed determined to sink to key support at $0.3578.</p>
          <p>So far, the $0.3578 has prevented a dip plunge twice, giving a reprieve to bulls. The support could be steady if BTC maintains a hold on $28K. However, bulls’ efforts could be complicated if BTC drops below $28K.</p>
          <h3>Will the $0.3578 support hold?</h3>
          <p>The retracement from mid-February saw ADA depreciate by 28%, dropping to $0.30. But the low price saw increased demand, tipping bulls for a recovery. Price action oscillated between $0.3236 – $0.3578 before breaking above the range after BTC zoomed to the $28K area.</p>
          <p>Bears could sink ADA to retest the $0.3578 support. But a close below the support could attract a more aggressive price dump that could push ADA towards the lower support at $0.3236, especially if BTC drops below $28K.</p>
          <p>But bulls could gain leverage if ADA closes above the price range upper level of $0.3876. Such an upswing could push the price toward $0.4056 or the overhead resistance level of $0.4201.</p>
          <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) faced rejection below the 60-mark and moved sideways after retreating from the oversold zone. It shows buying pressure eased. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved south, showing bears had more influence in the market.</p>
          <h3>CVD slope turned negative</h3>
          <p>According to Coinalyze, the aggregated CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) slope turned negative and moved downwards, indicating that sellers were more dominant in the market at press time. Therefore a retest of the $0.3578 was highly likely, and a breach below could occur if BTC falls below $28K.</p>
          <p>However, more short positions ($445K) have been liquidated in the past 24 hours compared to long positions ($345K). It shows an underlying bullish sentiment which could offer bulls hopes of a possible rebound at $0.3578. But investors should track BTC’s price movements for more profitable moves.</p>

          <p>Tether has expressed optimism about its profits in Q1, especially now that March is approaching its conclusion. The demand for USDT surged in during the quarterly period for numerous reasons but the road ahead might have some bumps.</p>
          <p>According to the latest reports, Tether expects more than $1 billion in total revenue from USDT in Q1. It also anticipates a $700 million profit for the quarter.</p>
          <p>The first three months of March have so far been quite eventful for USDT and the rest of the stablecoin segment following USDC’s depegging.</p>
          <p>USDT saw a large influx of volumes especially as many people migrated from USDC. This new volume added to Tether’s transaction revenue generated from USDT transactions.</p>
          <p>Tether also increased USDT supply in Q1 and continues to increase it further, according to recent data. There was roughly $77.6.14 billion worth of the stablecoin in circulation on Thursday according to the latest Glassnode data.</p>
          <p>But can this surge in circulating supply match the prevailing stablecoin demand? A comparison between active addresses and transfer volumes may provide some interesting insights.</p>
          <p>Active addresses peaked in mid-February, during which there was a surge in daily transfer volume. This is likely because of the outflows as the market saw ample demand.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, the USDT transfer volume had its highest peak on 11 March. This was mainly because of the aforementioned inflows due to USDC migration.</p>
          <p>However, transfer volume dropped since then due to outflows as demand for cryptocurrencies surged.</p>
          <h3>U.S. regulator finds inroad to criticize stablecoins</h3>
          <p>USDT’s growing circulation might be in preparation for more demand but it has not been without concerns.</p>
          <p>Many crypto proponents have expressed concerns regarding Tether’s ability to provide a proper guarantee of reserves. The SEC recently took advantage of those concerns to launch criticism against Tether and USDT.</p>
          <p>In fact, the SEC described proof of reserves as meaningless in a recent statement to investors. The latter constitutes the latest of the market’s concerns.</p>
          <p>Regulators have been increasingly pushing back against cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. However, some view this as a good sign that regulators are concerned about the crypto market appearing as a threat to the traditional finance system.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the current market views, there are still concerns about potential bank runs that may trigger the loss of stablecoin pegs in the future.</p>

          <p>Polygon [MATIC] witnessed a massive surge in transactions as the metric crossed $40 million in value on 24 March. MATIC was the only top-10 crypto that registered these numbers. Apart from Polygon, Fetch [FET], and The Sandbox [SAND] registered similar growth. </p>
          <p>It was also interesting to note that MATIC accumulation by whales was on a rise. Santiment’s chart revealed that MATIC’s supply held by top addresses went up over the last week, reflecting the investors’ confidence in the token. </p>
          <h3>Polygon gains in popularity</h3>
          <p>Not only did whales accumulate more MATIC, growth was also noted on other fronts. For instance, Dune’s chart indicated that MATIC’s unique users were on an increasing trend, indicating more usage and adoption of the network.</p>
          <p>Though there were several reasons for this growth, one of them can be attributed to the recent partnership of MATIC with Immutable, a leading Web3 gaming platform.</p>
          <h3>A quick overview of Polygon’s NFT space</h3>
          <p>While the number of unique addresses was rising, a decline was registered in NFT sales. According to CRYPTOSLAM’s chart, MATIC’s NFT sales volume declined by over 38% in the last seven days. Not only that, but after spiking during late February 2023, MATIC weekly volume on Polygon marketplaces declined sharply.</p>
          <p>Despite the decline in the NFT ecosystem, Polygon Daily, a popular Twitter handle that posts updates about the network’s development, tweeted about the most traded NFT collection on OpenSea. As per the tweet, CollectTrumpCards once again topped the list, followed by The Sandbox and Lens Protocol.</p>
          <h3>Other metrics looked decent</h3>
          <p>Things were looking pretty good for MATIC in terms of its on-chain performance. For instance, MATIC’s exchange reserve decreased, suggesting less selling pressure. The token’s supply outside of exchanges also increased, which is a typical bull signal.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the massive surge in transactions, MATIC’s network growth remained high last week, indicating that more new addresses were used to transfer MATIC. Additionally, more tokens were transferred among multiple addresses, which was evident from looking at MATIC’s spiking velocity on 21 March.</p>
          <h3>A bear takeover?</h3>
          <p>Though the metrics were fine, MATIC’s price action turned bearish lately. As per CoinMarketCap, the token’s price declined by over 1.8% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1.11 with a market capitalization of more than $9.6 billion. Polygon’s daily chart also gave a bearish notion and suggested a further price decline.</p>
          <p>The MACD displayed the possibility of a bearish crossover. MATIC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a slight decline, which was bearish. The Bollinger Band’s findings indicated that MATIC’s price was in a less volatile zone, further decreasing the chances of a northbound breakout in the near term.</p>
          <p>However, the token’s Money Flow Index (MFI) remained bullish, as it was moving above the neutral mark. Combining that with the upcoming zkEVM launch, the possibility of a trend reversal can’t be ruled out.</p>

          <p>The Aptos [APT] network is tapping into the latest hype around its platform to pursue more growth opportunities. Two of its latest announcements reveal that the network is eyeing growth opportunities in the music industry as well as pushing deeper into the NFT market.</p>
          <p>Aptos recently affirmed its plans to play an active role in the music industry and potentially even revolutionize it. The network aims to achieve this by bringing WEB3 benefits to the music industry through KYD apps.</p>
          <p>Aptos is likely going to leverage its NFT capabilities as part of its plans for the music industry. The network also conveniently launched OrderDAO, its new community governance protocol for NFT projects. The protocol will make it easier for projects to make efficient decentralized decisions regarding their future.</p>
          <h3>Can these announcements breathe new life into APT?</h3>
          <p>Aptos’ native cryptocurrency APT struggled to find directional performance this week after its rally last week. This suggests that the bulls ran out of momentum. Meanwhile, the bears have been pushing to take over. APT tanked by 6.8% to its $12.20 press time price.</p>
          <p>There are other reasons for investors to expect sell pressure to prevail. For example, APT’s RSI attempted to push below the 50% level. The price also encountered resistance above the $13.7 price range and it has been struggling to rally above its 50-day moving average.</p>
          <p>Numerous Aptos metrics show a higher potential for a pivot. For example, APT’s price volatility has been declining and is currently at a weekly low. In addition, the price experienced a sizable drop in volume between 23 – 24 March, confirmation that the bulls were losing strength.</p>
          <p>APT’s weighted sentiment dropped slightly in the last 24 hours at press time, confirming that some investors were losing faith in the bulls. However, its press time level was notably higher than its weekly low on 20 March.</p>
          <p>Aptos’ social dominance metric had its highest weekly spike in the last 24 hours. This was an important observation, as it may indicate that APT investors were aware of the bulls’ sluggishness.</p>
          <p>They may thus act in accordance with the current observations, potentially contributing to more sell pressure. Of course, this will depend on the overall market direction, which may regain its upside unexpectedly.</p>

          <p>However, this does not take away Lido’s position as the project which has accommodated the most staked Ether [stETH] ready to be unlocked on 12 April when the Ethereum’s [ETH] Shanghai upgrade takes place. </p>
          <p>Aave, on the other hand, may not boast of such, but its rise in popularity could also be due to Ethereum’s impact. With a $4.82 billion lifetime contribution, Ethereum has helped Aave record a substantial number in fees and revenue.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the non-custodial liquidity protocols have not experienced significant strides regarding developments. As of 23 March, development activity reached a yearly low of 3.792.</p>
          <p>A detailed understanding of the metric points to feature upgrades, and public commitment by the project’s developers to improve products under the blockchain.</p>
          <p>But at press time, there has been some recovery as the metric improved to 4.31. This implies that the developers’ activity contribution has been notably restored.</p>
          <h3>NFT volume rises as…</h3>
          <p>In addition to the TVL increase, NFT sales on the Aave network were also impressive over the week. According to Santiment, the digital collectibles volume reached $16.05 million on 20 March. Although it was reduced afterwards, most of the daily sales surpassed those of the previous week.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Aave’s activities during the week included playing its part in returning funds to those affected by the Platypus exploit. The exploit happened in February when a flashloan drained the Avalanche [AVAX]-based protocol of $9 million.</p>
          <p>Although it threatened the project’s solvency, Aave’s governance was able to help out as the rightful owners got back their funds.</p>

            <li>The blockchain developer share in the U.S. fell from 40% in 2017 to 29% in 2022.</li>
            <li>Emerging markets like India were capturing the share away from the U.S.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As per an analysis by Developer Report, the U.S. ceded a considerable chunk of the blockchain development pie to emerging markets around the world.</p>
          <p>The report highlighted that developer share in the U.S. fell from 40% in 2017 to 29% in 2022, corresponding to about 2% drop every year.</p>
          <p>The ongoing crackdown by regulators on centralized exchanges and other crypto participants has left the U.S. crypto sector in a state of trepidation, threatening the market dominance that the country has enjoyed over the last few years.</p>
          <h3>India, Ukraine show consistent web3 growth</h3>
          <p>The overall growth in development activity was encouraging, even as the crypto network value dropped to January 2018 levels, the report underlined. The number of developers jumped almost by four times during the same time period.</p>
          <p>U.S. was still the market leader at the time of writing, accounting for 29% of all blockchain developers. European nations also enjoyed a combined market share of 29% while Asia was home to 13% of all web3 developers.</p>
          <p>But while U.S.’ share has declined over the years, emerging markets like India saw their developer share steadily increasing from 2% in 2017 to 6% in 2022. India’s growth trajectory showed more consistency as compared to other regions, the report stated.</p>
          <p>India’s lucrativeness as a growing market for blockchain development was evidenced by the data showing how the country was eating into the share of the U.S.</p>
          <p>Data from Europe also revealed an interesting development. While UK and Germany lead in developer share, both countries saw their dominance decline in the 2017-2022 period. Conversely, conflict-ridden Ukraine’s share increased from 4% to 6% since the war.</p>
          <h3>Will it only get worse?</h3>
          <p>Recently there were reports that Coinbase was contemplating setting up a trading platform outside the U.S. While Coinbase didn’t make any official statement, the report had weight owing to concerns of an enforcement action on the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, said in an interview that the crypto industry has already moved overseas and the hawkish stances of the SEC may dent the prospects of U.S. as an inviting destination for blockchain development and cryptos.</p>

          <p>The implementation of the long-anticipated Shapella hard fork took place on Ethereum’s Goerli network on March 15. This resulted in a brief pause in Optimism‘s Goerli nodes. Goerli is a network utilized by Ethereum developers for testing purposes. Nevertheless, the Optimism protocol persevered, with its ecosystem flourishing despite the disruption to the Goerli nodes.</p>
          <h3>Glass half full</h3>
          <p>The growth of Optimism’s ecosystem is evident in the neck-to-neck competition for its 10th grant cycle. This cycle received a high number of applications, with many developers and applications competing for a grant to build on the network. The incentives to build on Optimism could help the protocol in attracting more developers and users to the network.</p>
          <p>One of the applicants is a dApp called KyberSwap, which has seen its Optimism-based volumes grow by 9 times over the past year. While Uniswap and Velodrome still hold a lead over KyberSwap in terms of volume, the incentives to build on Optimism are attracting more developers and users to the network.</p>
          <p>Another sign of the network’s expansion is the rise in its transaction volume. The same has increased from 159,600 transactions to 269,700 transactions over the last few months.</p>
          <p>However, despite this hike, the fees generated by the protocol have declined. This, likely due to greater competition among layer-2 solutions, something that has driven down fees generated by the network.</p>
          <h3>And the state of OP is…</h3>
          <p>Despite the decline in fees, the price of the OP token has continued to rise. This is a sign that investors have faith in the long-term potential of the Optimism network. Coupled with that, the MVRV ratio for OP declined, indicating that most holders would not profit if they sold their holdings. This is a sign that there is low selling pressure on OP at this point.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the long/short difference for the OP token has been highly positive too. This is evidence that many holders are long-term investors who are unlikely to sell their holdings.</p>

          <p>Christine Kim, the Vice President of Research at Galaxy Digital, recently appeared on a podcast hosted by Laura Shin. Kim, who is an experienced Ethereum researcher, shared her thoughts on the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade and its impact on the network and ETH’s price. </p>
          <h3>Shanghai upgrade will stress test the network</h3>
          <p>Ethereum validators have eagerly anticipated the Shanghai upgrade for a while. EIP 4895 is arguably the most-awaited aspect of the upgrade, which will unlock staked Ether and allow its withdrawals. Speaking about the upgrade, Christine Kim noted that the activation of staked ETH withdrawals on Ethereum is a major milestone. According to her, Shanghai and Capella aren’t necessarily different upgrades since they both work towards the same goal of enabling withdrawals of staked ETH. </p>
          <p>As for the subsequent Capella upgrade, Kim claimed that Capella illustrates the changes that will come to the beacon chain, the consensus layer of Ethereum, while Shanghai illustrates the changes that will come to the execution layer of Ethereum.</p>
          <p><b>“When you withdraw your stake, your stake is coming out of the beacon chain, but it’s being moved to an address where you can interact with (it) on the execution layer of Ethereum.”</b></p>
          <p>When asked about the impact of the withdrawals of staked Ether on the network, Kim acknowledged that it is a matter of concern, given that there are more than 17.5 million staked ETH at the moment. She agreed that mass withdrawal of staked Ether will stress test the limitations of the network. She also added that withdrawals will impact the incentives, with the network increasing rewards in order to attract validators.</p>
          <ul><li>Liquid staking platforms post Shanghai upgrade</li></ul>
          <p>Given Ethereum’s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, liquid staking platforms have become much more relevant for the network. Christine Kim revealed that Lido finance, the largest liquid staking provider which controls more than a third of the total staked Ether, is currently working towards becoming more decentralized. According to her, this initiative is really important for the health of Ethereum over time.</p>
          <p>Rocketpool is gearing up for an upgrade where instead of validator node operators being required to post 16 ETH, the requirement is being slashed by half to 8 ETH. The liquid staking provider is also exploring other upgrades where the staking requirement can be reduced further for institutional staking providers.</p>
          <p>As for Ethereum’s roadmap, the full focus is on increasing scalability and changing its data structure. In fact, according to the analyst, the roadmap is “very ambitious.”</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Binance Coin [BNB] reacted extremely positively over the past two days of trading. The bullish euphoria over Bitcoin’s gains translated across the crypto-market and BNB gained by 20.5% within four days. A retracement before a sustained move higher up the charts remains possible too.</p>
          <p>On the daily timeframe, the market structure for Binance Coin seemed to be bullish once more. The recent lower high at $294 was beaten during the latest reversal, but the $309-mark has posed some resistance over the past 24 hours.</p>
          <h3>A strong confluence of support at $292</h3>
          <p>The Volume Profile Visible Range showed that the price was right above the Point of Control, based on the trading from 8 February. The POC was at $304.2, and Binance Coin seemed to be retesting it as support, at the time of writing.</p>
          <p>The Value Area High and Low were found at $322.8 and $274.7, respectively. This meant that $304.2 and $274.7 are two levels buyers will be interested in. In fact, a set of Fibonacci retracement levels (yellow) were drawn based on the latest surge too.</p>
          <p>It showed the 78,6% retracement level lay at $276.7, which was almost the same level as the VAL. Moreover, the price action from early March showed the $285-$292 region was significant support on the lower timeframes. The RSI crossed over above the neutral 50-level and indicated bullish momentum had taken root. The OBV also recorded gains and could continue higher.</p>
          <p>Therefore, longer-term buyers can wait for a retracement into the $285-$292 zone. More risk-averse traders can wait for a positive reaction over three days before looking to buy and trade with the trend.</p>
          <ul><li>Spot CVD surges past February highs in response to demand</li></ul>
          <p>The funding rate had been negative over the last two days, but it has since slowly climbed above into positive territory. This implied long positions were once more dominant in the market – Signs of a possible flip in sentiment.</p>
          <p>The rising spot CVD underlined strong demand, but the Open Interest dipped over the last 48 hours. And yet, the price has appreciated during this time, which is evidence of weakening bullish sentiment.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>While the bears have controlled MATIC’s market since mid-February, bulls only gained considerable leverage on 10 March. At the time, while the price action rebounded from $0.943, it has since faced stiff resistance levels.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Bitcoin [BTC] faced rejection around the $26K zone and dropped below $25K, further undermining the rest of the altcoin’s market recovery in the short-term. However, a retest of BTC’s latest highs could lead the altcoin market into a renewed recovery process.</p>
          <h3>MATIC’s recovery at stake – Can bulls push forward?</h3>
          <p>MATIC’s drop since mid-February was successfully stopped by the $.9427 support. The support was also crucial in January. Bulls cleared the hurdle at 200-period MA (Moving Average), the 20 EMA (Exponential Moving Average), and the $1.1654-resistance level. At press time, MATIC was struggling to bypass the obstacle at $1.23, partly due to BTC’s price fluctuations.</p>
          <p>Bulls could attempt to clear the $1.23 hurdle if BTC surges above $25K. A close above the hurdle could push the price towards the overhead resistance of $1.5723, especially if the obstacle at $1.34 is cleared too.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, BTC fluctuations could set MATIC into a consolidation range of $1.17 – $1.23 if 20 EMA remains steady. However, MATIC could sink to the new low of $0.943 if bears clear the obstacle at 200 MA ($1.0414).</p>
          <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retreated from the oversold territory – Evidence of increased buying pressure over the past few days. However, the Average Directional Index (ADX) slope hadn’t moved north, indicating a weak uptrend direction which should caution bulls.</p>
          <h3>Funding rate was positive, but CVD fell</h3>
          <p>According to the crypto-derivatives data platform Coinalyze, MATIC’s funding rates have been positive since March 13. It underlined increased demand for MATIC in the derivatives market, which helped bypass the $1.1654-hurdle.</p>
          <p>However, the CVD (cumulative volume delta) fell with a negative slope, indicating sellers were gaining leverage in the market. If the CVD was flat, it would mean neither buyers nor sellers had absolute leverage. On the contrary, a positive slope and growth would suggest buyers’ greater market influence. The negative slope, therefore, could complicate the recovery.</p>

            <li>Social sentiment in connection with Cardano has begun to rise</li>
            <li>Project’s TVL also hiked while its founder pushed for a bank-free crypto-sector</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cardano [ADA], the decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, has put up with consistent neglect by folks in the crypto-channel. The lack of attention given to the network might be surprising though, especially as the ecosystem reacted positively to recent crises in the industry.</p>
          <h3>An escape route for the fallen</h3>
          <p>However, according to on-chain data, Cardano’s struggles are not really a recent matter. In fact, Santiment data revealed that social dominance has hit severe rock bottom repeatedly since 26 February.</p>
          <p>Social dominance gauges the percentage of discussions around an asset among the top-100 per market capitalization. However, the project’s image seems to be on its way to redemption as the metric hit 2.687% on 14 March. Despite its modest decrease at the time of writing, the condition confirmed that Cardano’s mentions across socials had become mainstream.</p>
          <p>While the aforementioned proved that sentiment might be changing, the development activity had a reading of 85.26. This metric detects the improvements in a project’s network and commitment to its core fixes. </p>
          <p>At press time, Cardano’s Development Activity did not measure very highly. Instead, it fell slightly but remained around the zone it has occupied since March began. This implied that there has been no notable demand for upgrades on Cardano.</p>
          <p>Another metric that could ignite recognition for ADA is whale activity. According to Santiment, Cardano transactions in the $100,000 to $1 million range have been hitting several highs since January. In fact, at the time of writing, a hundred ADA $100,000 transactions had taken place already on 15 March.</p>
          <p>These values describe a “buy the dip” situation. However, there is no confirmation that ADA’s current value is close to its bottom. Even so, consistent action could drive retail interest and possibly, rekindle the neglect that Cardano has been facing. </p>
          <h3>More deposits, but there’s a need for independence</h3>
          <p>Looking at its Total Value Locked (TVL), Cardano gained by 188.01% over the last 30 days. TVL measures the total value of all crypto-assets staked or locked up in a protocol. Interestingly, the hike also helped Cardano jump into the top-20 chains per TVL.</p>
          <p>An assessment of the information provided by DeFi Llama showed that the milestone would have been impossible if not for the contribution of Aada, Miniswap, and its algorithmic stablecoin – Djed.</p>
          <p>However, this does not automatically assure us that its recently-acquired escape from disregard would last.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the project’s founder Charles Hoskinson weighed in on the problems facing the U.S. banking industry. Hoskinson noted that the crypto-sector needs to re-assess its attachment to traditional financial institutions.</p>

          <p>At press time, the AI-focused token’s value was $0.4310, down 10% in the last 24 hours. However, FET could benefit from a renewed AI narrative.</p>

          <p>Therefore, FET could surge to the bearish order block and 78.6% Fib level of $0.5423 or to overhead resistance at $0.6089 if it closes above the 50% Fib level ($0.4533). Such a move could offer two possible trades. </p>
          <p>First, a risky approach targeting the 78.6% Fib level ($0.5423). The entry will be above $0.4533 with a stop loss at 23.6% Fib level ($0.3711). The second option is a $0.6089-target with similar entry and stop loss levels. Each will offer an RR of 1:2.5 and 1:4, respectively. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, a close below 23.6% Fib level (($0.3711) would invalidate the bullish thesis. If the previous support holds again, the drop could offer new buying opportunities at $0.30. Short-sellers can short the asset if it closes below $0.3711 and repurchases it cheaply at $0.30.</p>
          <p>The RSI (Relative Strength Index) rose, but was slightly above equilibrium, showing buying pressure reduced significantly. However, rising OBV (On Balance Volume) could boost further uptrend. </p>
          <h3>FET saw rising Mean Coin Age and greater positive sentiment</h3>
          <p>FET recorded a rising 90-day Mean Coin Age, indicating a wide-network accumulation – A potential rally signal. Similarly, the weighted sentiment exhibited a highly positive elevation, showing investors were bullish on the token. </p>
          <p>Worth noting that the spike in supply on exchanges is a sign of short-term selling pressure. This, however, is unlikely to undermine a long-term recovery. </p>

            <li>USDC regained its peg after Circle moved quickly with new banking partners.</li>
            <li>USDC demonstrated signs of demand and volume recovery.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Circle faced its toughest week so far this year after USD Coin [USDC] lost its dollar peg. It has since recovered, but the stablecoin issuer just released a new update regarding its USDC operations.</p>
          <p>According to the update, Circle redeemed 2.9 billion USDC and minted 700 million USDC on 14 March. Those efforts were part of its action plan to aid the peg recovery. More importantly, Circle announced that it was securing new transaction banking partners. The company’s goal is to facilitate round-the-clock transactions that will not be limited by regular banking hours.</p>
          <p>Circle further revealed that it had limited funds held by its transaction banking partners to support redemption and minting. It also revealed that it held a cash position of its reserve at BNY Mellon. Thus, at press time, it had on-ramps for users looking to move their funds into the crypto segment.</p>
          <p>The move by Circle underscored plans to bypass regulators’ efforts to prevent banks from working with crypto companies. It also came just days after multiple banks collapsed, adding more pressure to the fiat system. As a result, more people were losing their trust in the fiat system, and this was a key factor that fueled the rally in the last three days.</p>
          <h3>USDC volumes are recovering</h3>
          <p>The aforementioned factors and the fact that USDC has regained its test have restored some confidence back into the stablecoin. The supply of USDC in smart contracts recently bounced back to a new four-month high.</p>
          <p>But what about actual market demand? Well, a look at address characteristics revealed that USDC receiving addresses were slightly higher than sending addresses. Another key observation is that both metrics dropped substantially since 11 March, as people moved to other stablecoins.</p>
          <p>However, addresses began leveling out at press time, suggesting that USDC trading activity is recovering. This is evident in the stablecoin’s exchange flows. Both exchange inflows and outflows have been on the rise for the last three days after previously tanking because of the depeg.</p>
          <p>The exchange outflows remain higher than inflows, hence confirming that USDC is yet to regain full confidence. This may also be due to the recent crypto rally, which meant that investors have been buying crypto for stablecoins.</p>

            <li>MakerDAO’s RWA holdings led to profits amid stablecoin market issues.</li>
            <li>Protocol maintains stability but faces a decline in unique users.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The stablecoin market faced a significant challenge as USD Coin [USDC] came under scrutiny. MakerDAO, the protocol behind stablecoin DAI, also felt the impact. But despite this, MakerDAO saw profits, thanks to its RWA holdings.</p>
          <p>According to data provided by Delphi Digital, MakerDAO made a $3.8 million profit through its RWA holdings. These holdings contribute significantly to MakerDAO’s overall earnings, making up 11.6% of its total holdings. Real World Asset (RWA) is a type of collateral that is not cryptocurrency-based but is more traditional and tangible, such as U.S. Treasury Bills and Bonds.</p>
          <h3>Having a closer look</h3>
          <p>However, MakerDAO’s PnL statement painted a negative outlook due to high expenses on upgrades and updates. A significant portion of MakerDAO’s earnings are possibly being spent on upgrading and maintaining the protocol. These expenses outweighed their earnings, leading to a net loss for MakerDAO.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, MakerDAO’s recent proposal to create PSM circuit breakers shows its dedication to improving its protocols, considering the market’s volatility. This proposal will allow Maker governance to disable a PSM immediately without governance delay. This step will ensure that the protocol can react quickly to market changes and maintain stability.</p>
          <p>The state of the protocol was relatively healthy as the volume on MakerDAO increased by 55% over the past month. This shows that despite the challenges faced by the stablecoin market, MakerDAO has maintained its momentum.</p>
          <p>However, the number of unique users in the same period declined by 14% according to Messari’s data. This decline has affected the overall TVL generated by MakerDAO, leading to a decline over the past few days.</p>
          <h3>MKR and DAI</h3>
          <p>Along with a decline in TVL, MKR token’s prices declined.</p>
          <p>However, whale interest in the token skyrocketed. This interest from whales could be due to the fact that the market cap of DAI increased materially over the last few days. This interest in both MKR and DAI indicated the potential for future profits and belief in the long-term viability of the protocol.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Coinbase enters the Singapore market through strategic partnership with Standard Chartered.</li>
            <li>The launch was flagged off through regulatory approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On 15 March, Coinbase announced that it had secured a partnership with TradFi giant Standard Chartered. This move undermined recent directives by regulators aiming to prevent the flow of liquidity into the crypto market.</p>
          <p>Crypto regulators issued a directive to U.S banks in February, requiring them not to engage in business with crypto companies. However, Coinbase moved forward nonetheless. According to a recent announcement, the partnership will provide a free on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto users in Singapore.</p>
          <p>Coinbase also revealed that it updated its help center so that it can offer learning material for over 200 crypto assets. This is a surprising change of pace for Singapore users because regulators in the country previously criticized cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <h3>Are CEXes shifting its focus outside the U.S.?</h3>
          <p>The Coinbase announcement came at a time when the U.S. market has been facing economic turmoil due to inflation and a recent banking crisis. On top of that, the U.S. appears to be taking an aggressive stance against the crypto market.</p>
          <p>This new development underscores Coinbase’s push into other promising markets outside the U.S. Singapore is one of those markets that has also been embracing opportunities in the blockchain and crypto space. The exchange plans to leverage the Singpass platform, which is native to Singapore, part of the conduit for its crypto offerings.</p>
          <h3>Coinbase secures regulatory approval from Singaporean authorities</h3>
          <p>Coinbase announced through its official blog that its foray into Singapore is just the start of its global expansion. Part of the reason the Asian country is among the first international targets for Coinbase is regulatory approval. Coinbase is now allowed to offer regulated Digital Payment Token (DPT) services through in-principal approval. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) offered the approval.</p>
          <p>The regulatory path underscores Singapore’s favorable stance for the crypto market. This theme has reverberated across multiple jurisdictions in the Asian region and even in some European countries. Numerous other countries may follow in Singapore’s footsteps, especially now that the crypto market is maturing. FOMO will be the key driver as more countries play catchup to avoid missing out on opportunities.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin slid below $24,500 as investors weighed a potential European banking meltdown triggered by concerns about often-embattled Credit Suisse.</p>
          <p>The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped to $23,946 at one point before regaining ground to recently trade at $24,502, roughly flat over the 24 hours. But that was still well off BTC's highs of the previous day when it soared past $26,000 after the release of a mildly upbeat consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for February. The 6% CPI improved on the previous month’s reading and offered investors looking for more monetary policy dovishness hope the U.S. Federal Reserve would at least temporarily stop its recent diet of interest rate hikes.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday, banking troubles trumped monetary policy considerations.</p>
          <p>Shares of the Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse (CS), which has been rocked by scandals over the past year and posted losses for five consecutive quarters, tanked on Wednesday after the bank’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest capital beyond the $1.5 billion it sank into the bank last year. Saudi National Bank owns a stake of up to 9.9%.</p>
          <p>The Swiss National Bank seemed to at least temporarily halt the damage after announcing it would provide CS with liquidity “if necessary,” and rejecting the notion that contagion tied to the failure of two, large U.S. regional banks over the past week had spread overseas.</p>
          <p>Credit Suisse shares tumbled 13%, as did several European banking stocks including French banks BNP Paribas (BNP.PA) and Société Générale (GLE:FP), down by 8% and 10%, respectively. European markets tumbled as investors in riskier assets grew skittish.</p>
          <p>U.S. equity markets initially tumbled on the banking news coming from Europe before recovering some of their losses. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.05%.</p>
          <p>Regional banking stocks also plunged, with First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW) falling 21% and 13%, respectively.</p>
          <p>“Credit Suisse is a bigger story than Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and this has Wall Street extremely nervous,” ​​Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday email. “Bitcoin’s decline isn’t that bad when you consider how much pressure is hitting stocks, oil prices and the euro.”</p>
          <p>While banking turmoil could ultimately become a bullish moment for bitcoin, “for now crypto weakness is justified,” Moya added.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the CME FedWatch Tool showed that currently around 55% of traders believe the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting March 22. An additional 45% expect the Fed to boost the rate by 25 basis points (bps), a stark change from a week ago when an increasing number of observers felt the Fed would increase the rate by 50 bps.</p>
          <p>Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at technical analysis-based research firm Fairlead Strategies, said BTC's resistance is strong near $25,200, while tackling “intermediate-term overbought conditions in place that have become a headwind."</p>
          <p>“This increases short-term downside risk to support from the 200-day [moving average] (~$19,800),” Tamplin told CoinDesk in an email.</p>
          <p>Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was hovering around $1,656 Wednesday afternoon, down 2.4% from Tuesday, same time. HNT, the native token of the decentralized wireless communication network Helium, recently tumbled 13% to trade near $2 Wednesday, its lowest level in two months. The decline came after Binance.US said it would delist the cryptocurrency on March 21.</p>
          <p>The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was down roughly 3% for the day.</p>

          <p>The release of the CPI data was just around the corner, at the time of writing. Ease in inflation is expected, but is this expectation already priced in? Does that explain the recent Bitcoin pump right into a zone of resistance at this critical moment? And, what can that mean for Polkadot traders?</p>
          <p>Traders can prepare themselves for the bullish and the bearish scenarios. Since DOT is also at a critical inflection point, its next leg is not yet certain. Evidence for the next move can be awaited before assuming positions in the market.</p>
          <h3>The daily bearish breaker is likely to oppose DOT bulls</h3>
          <p>A former bullish order block, which was flipped to a bearish breaker in early March, was highlighted by the red box. At the time of writing, the price was within this zone, testing it as a zone of supply. Moreover, this area had confluence with the $6.1-level of resistance. Bitcoin was trading just below the $25.2k resistance, which marked the highs of August 2022 and February.</p>
          <p>If BTC can break out past this resistance, it would signal bullish sentiment across the market. This could prime DOT to climb past the $6.1-level as well. However, a daily session close above the breaker would be required before buyers can look for opportunities to enter long positions. The market structure was on the verge of flipping bullish as well, as the recent lower high at $6.06 from 5 March could be beaten.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if the price sees rejection and falls beneath the $5.75-level, it would be a sign that bears had taken control. Short sellers can thereafter look to short the asset, with a stop-loss above the $6.1-mark. To the south, targets would be the $5.6-level and the March low at $5.15.</p>
          <p>The RSI was at neutral 50 at press time, while the A/D line had climbed over the past few weeks to show strong buying pressure. This was another indication that DOT was in a significant area, but it appeared the buyers had an edge.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>OI indicated participants could be trying to fade the rally</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Funding Rate jumped into positive territory to signal that the sentiment was bullish. However, the 1-hour chart showed a drop in Open Interest over the last 12 hours preceding the time of writing. In this period, the price continued to climb higher.</p>
          <p>This suggested that long positions were discouraged and bearish sentiment began to take hold. And yet, it could be too early to short Polkadot. The reaction of Bitcoin over the next couple of days would show the direction of the market over the coming weeks.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Polkadot has announced the launch of an NFT marketplace by Beatport on Aventus</li>
            <li>Polkadot NFT volume fairly normal as DOT commenced recovery on price charts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Polkadot is making a significant play in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT), and Web 3 arena as the space grows and the link gets deeper. The development of the Internet and how we interact with digital assets are tied to Web3 and NFTs. Polkadot is putting its foot down early with a recent collaboration announcement with Beatport. Needless to say, a favorable effect on DOT may be on the cards too.</p>
          <h3>The Polkadot partnership with Beatport</h3>
          <p>NFTs are a crucial application of Web3 technology, enabling the creation and ownership of unique digital assets that can be verified on a blockchain. As the Web 3 ecosystem grows, we expect to see more innovative uses of NFTs and other blockchain-based assets.</p>
          <p>Polkadot is taking action in this direction by launching an NFT marketplace. The move is part of an initiative to promote electronic music culture to Web3 and is being carried out in conjunction with global music powerhouse Beatport. With the debut of the Beatport marketplace on Polkadot’s sidechain Aventus, record labels and musicians will have a new channel to promote their work and monetize their fan bases.</p>
          <h3>Parachains, NFTs, and Polkadot (DOT)</h3>
          <p>Polkadot is a platform for many blockchains to interact with each other. As such, it seeks to address the issue of blockchain interoperability by facilitating the exchange between multiple blockchains. Polkadot’s architecture, consisting of a “relay chain” and “parachains,” allows it to be interoperable with other systems.</p>
          <p>In Polkadot, the main or relay chain serves as a hub to which all of the subchains, or parachains, connect. Parachains are a type of blockchain with enhanced capabilities, including interaction with the relay chain and inter-parachain communication.</p>
          <p>Polkadot allows developers to design their parachains or link to pre-existing ones to create and trade NFTs. In addition to Aventus, other parachains on Polkadot that support NFTs include Basilisk, Astar, and Statemint. Here, the Polkadot (DOT) token is vital in protecting all parachains, which are still linked to the relay chain.</p>
          <h3>The state of NFTs and DOT’s volume</h3>
          <p>Only once in March has the overall NFT transaction volume for Polkadot in USD on Santiment surpassed $1 million, according to an analysis of the data. In fact, the value was just $341,000, at the time of writing.</p>
          <p>With no significant spikes, this volume metric showed that NFT trades on the network were reasonable. With the opening of the new NFT marketplace on Aventus, could this situation alter itself though?</p>
          <p>Likewise, DOT’s volume on Santiment has been typical, with no noticeable spikes. This volume is similar to the NFT volume. Nonetheless, the volume has picked up and has been on an uptrend after a fall seen on March 12. The volume was already over 369 million, at the time of writing.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Polkadot (DOT) was trading at about $6.12 on the price charts following a 24-hour hike of 3%. At the time of writing, however, some bearish momentum was creeping into its price performance.</p>
          <p>Regarding NFTs, collections, and volume, Polkadot is still behind chains like Solana and Ethereum. And yet, with the popularity of its marketplaces and distinctive NFT selections on its parachains, it might emerge as a prominent force. Its entry into the NFT market may also have a favorable effect on the DOT token.</p>

This, following the decision by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to restore all customer deposits at failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p>
          <p>When SVB collapsed on 11 March, BCH slipped below $110 and oscillated between $109 and $110 for most of the weekend. However, as BTC’s price rallied in the early trading hours of 13 March following the Federal Regulators’ decision to make all SVIB depositors whole, BCH reclaimed $110 and exceeded it.</p>
          <p>Still on a rally at press time, BCH’s price had appreciated by 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $127.31.</p>
          <h3>Are the bulls here to stay?</h3>
          <p>An assessment of BCH’s price movement on the daily chart revealed that the latest rally was leading up to the commencement of a new bull cycle.</p>
          <p>At press time, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was preparing to intersect with the trend line in an upward direction. Once this happens, a new bull cycle would begin and BCH’s price will appreciate further.</p>
          <p>Thanks to improving sentiment and growing accumulation, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reclaimed its spot above the 50-neutral line and was pegged at 52.18. Likewise, the dynamic line of BCH’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a positive reading of 0.17.</p>
          <p>This was another piece of evidence supporting the notion that BCH’s price will appreciate further, especially if positive sentiment lingers.</p>
          <ul><li>Set-up for success on-chain</li></ul>
          <p>According to on-chain data provider Santiment, BCH has seen sustained demand over the last 24 hours. As a result, the count of daily active addresses transacting the coin has hiked by 100%. At press time, 132,370 addresses were transacting BCH.</p>
          <p>Greater network activity is a known recipe for the sustained rally of an asset’s price. With BCH’s weighted sentiment still in positive territory, if the active addresses count continues to rally, buying momentum will grow. This will eventually lead to a another significant price uptick.</p>
          <p>Consider this – In the last 24 hours alone, BCH’s Open Interest has risen by 5%. Generally, an increase in Open Interest is considered a bullish signal, especially as it suggests that there is growing optimism and confidence in the asset’s price direction.</p>
          <p>Hence, BCH’s price might continue to appreciate. However, a decline in the king coin’s price might also precipitate a fall in BCH’s value.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Whales added 400,000 ETH despite a recent price increment</li>
            <li>More ETH is being circulated although the current vault could be overpriced</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Like a ton of assets in the crypto-market, Ethereum’s [ETH] price jumped over the weekend. Even at press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value maintained a 5.11% hike in the last 24 hours. Needless to say, this has brought some calm to the market. Especially since much of it was flashing red over the weekend.</p>
          <p>However, despite the gains registered on the charts, whales did not seem to be content. As pointed out by Ali_charts, a crypto-analyst on Twitter, addresses holding 1000 to 10000 ETH added $600 million to their holdings.</p>
          <p>The information, derived from Glassnode, revealed that the whales took the action when ETH was still hovering above $1,680 on the charts.</p>
          <h3>On the opposite side of ETH</h3>
          <p>So, does the accumulation mean ETH still has a tendency to climb further? Well, according to Glassnode, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) signal had a reading of 98.45, at press time. The metric often reflects the 90-day moving average trend of the daily transaction volume, rather than a day-to-day valuation.</p>
          <p>Compared to its value in recent times, the aforementioned NVT signal is a high one. And, the last time it was as high was back in February 2020. Hence, it seemed to confirm that investors were pricing ETH at a premium while the market cap’s growth outpaced its on-chain transaction volume.</p>
          <p>While the aforementioned metric considered ETH as being currently overpriced, more of the altcoin has been in circulation over the last seven days. The circulation shows the number of unique coins that have been used for transactions within a specific period.</p>
          <p>At press time, the seven-day circulation was 3.96 million. This implied that many units of ETH were swirling around the market, despite their numbers falling when compared to the previous day.</p>
          <p>That being said, one metric that has consistently moved north is Active Addresses. This metric measures the number of unique addresses active on a network. With 24-hour active address count of 534,000, the reading implied that many wallets had either received or sent ETH over the last 24 hours.</p>
          <h3>Almost equal exchange flow reactions</h3>
          <p>While ETH remains on whales’ radar, activities on exchanges revealed that it has been a close contest for outflows and inflows.</p>
          <p>In fact, according to Santiment, exchange outflows were as high as 28,400. This seemed to underline traders’ temporary market shortage and contribution to an asset’s appreciation.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the exchange inflows were 24,000. With the difference in favor of the outflows, it means that ETH has a slight chance of foregoing depreciation in the short term.</p>
          <p>However, traders might still need to be cautious of projection. This, because of several negative developments and contrasting market reactions.</p>

            <li>CEXs registered a massive surge in usage and balance after USDC’s de-peg</li>
            <li>Sustained interest in various CEX tokens also recorded a hike</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Despite the adverse effects of the USDC situation on various aspects of the cryptocurrency sector, centralized exchanges were able to reap significant gains during this time.</p>
          <h3>CEXs reap rewards</h3>
          <p>According to data provided by Messari, activity on CEXs hit a 12-month high due to USDC’s de-pegging event. Exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Kraken all recorded an uptick in activity over this period.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons for the high activity was the drop in Externally Owned Addresses on Ethereum. Externally Owned Addresses (EOAs) are user-controlled accounts on the Ethereum blockchain that are owned and controlled by individual users. Unlike contract accounts, which are controlled by code, EOAs are controlled by their private keys and can only be accessed by their respective owners.</p>
          <p>Most of the USDC ecosystem was integrated with the Ethereum blockchain. As the USDC stablecoin deviated from its peg, the EOAs dropped by $4 billion in value. However, centralized exchanges (CEXs) managed to accommodate this excess supply and registered a significant 49% hike in their balance as a result.</p>
          <p>At the time of writing, Binance was leading in terms of exchange balance, with $31.9 billion on its platform. In comparison, OKX and Bitfinex came in second and third place with $5.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.</p>
          <ul><li>Momentum on the way?</li></ul>
          <p>Following the FTX incident, numerous long-term users found it difficult to have faith in other centralized exchanges. Overcoming this mistrust was a major challenge for these exchanges. Nonetheless, the implementation of proof of reserves helped to establish some degree of trust and data transparency for customers using centralized exchanges.</p>
          <p>Binance, KuCoin, and OKX have all provided proof of reserves for their customers to see. Proof of reserves showcase the overall percentage distribution of all the assets that have been stored by these exchanges. A majority of these exchanges currently have high amounts of ETH and USDT held as reserves.</p>
          <p>The fall of USDC, coupled with the trust gained by CEXs by showing their reserves, helped generate interest in their tokens as well. In fact, over the last few days, the market caps of BNB, OKB, and KCS have all increased.</p>

            <li>Ripple updated its EVM sidechain development with access to the Testnet.</li>
            <li>XRP’s network growth declined, but developers remained significantly active.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On 14 March, RippleX, the open platform of the Ripple [XRP] network, confirmed that its sidechain was available on its Testnet. Built on the XRP Ledger [XRPL], the Ethereum Virtual Machine [EVM] sidechain would enable 1000 transactions per second on the ledger.</p>
          <p>Contextually, the XRPL is a public blockchain led by Ripple’s developer community. The ledger is part of the ecosystem responsible for aiding asset transfer globally. So, now that the sidechain EVM Mainnet is approaching, cross-chain bridging could improve the network.</p>
          <h3>The dream is edging close to reality</h3>
          <p>In September 2021, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz passed the proposal of the EVM side chain to the Ripple community. He backed up the proposal by noting that developers could build their own blockchain on the XRPL Mainnet using smart contracts.</p>
          <p>Following the public introduction, blockchain technology firm Peersyst released the first phase of the EVM sidechain in October 2022. While a few compatible bridges were developed at that time, the latest update serves as the second phase of the project.</p>
          <p>The RippleX communique further mentioned:</p>
          <p><b>“Phase two of the project, on track for early 2023, will feature a permissionless EVM sidechain and bridge with a unique design that connects to the XRPL Devnet to expand participation and test scalability within a controlled environment”</b></p>
          <p>Interestingly, data available on the XRPL showed that 2,476,468 blocks had been created on the sidechain at press time. Additionally, 16,079 transactions had taken place among 179,045 addresses on the ledger.</p>
          <h3>Ripple developers are answering the call despite…</h3>
          <p>In the intervening time, the XRP development activity ditched the downside and trended higher. Moreso, the development activity measures the contribution count of developers on a project regarding upgrades. At the time of writing, the metric was 2.52, verifying that Ripple developers were actively in operation.</p>
          <p>However, the network growth did not portray similar strength. A simplification of this metric summarized the behavioral bias for adoption and the number of new addresses who have successfully transacted on the network. So, the condition down at 774 meant that XRP had been struggling despite investors who were gaining deep interest in the token.</p>
          <p>Recently, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse admitted that the blockchain-payment firm had exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). However, he cleared the air that it would never affect its operations. Thus, this EVM development could serve as concrete proof that the Ripple network was not significantly affected.</p>

            <li>Polygon [MATIC] continued on its consecutive rise at press time.</li>
            <li>Its social dominance rose with the introduction of the Polygon domain.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There have been many recent periods of uptrend activity on Polygon [MATIC], suggesting that the cryptocurrency has emerged from the doldrums it was mired in since 18 February. With the token garnering some attention in terms of social volume, its movement on exchanges is something that investors can keep monitoring.</p>
          <h3>Polygon sees positive social volume</h3>
          <p>As per Santiment’s chart, Polygon has experienced a boost in its social volume. The observed chart indicated that the last time MATIC experienced such an uptrend was in August. According to Alicharts, this shift was also suggestive of optimistic attitudes that could benefit the asset’s price. As of this writing, the social volume metric was over 1,000, and the weighted sentiment was over 2.2.</p>
          <p>Did the price increase in tandem with the social volume?</p>
          <h3>MATIC on a daily timeframe</h3>
          <p>Until 10 March, the daily timeframe chart of MATIC had trended downward for several weeks. However, the token reversed course on the aforementioned date, having increased by over 20% and trading at about $1.24 as of this writing.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the trend reversal was strong enough to shift the asset’s trend from bearish to bullish. According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), MATIC crossed the neutral line. A weak bullish sentiment was also indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which revealed that it had shifted to the upside.</p>
          <p>The volume metric has also been increasing with the recent price increase. The volume was above 979 million as of the time of writing and was getting close to one billion.</p>
          <h3>Observing the trend of the flow</h3>
          <p>The Exchange NetFlow of Polygon provided additional evidence of the strength of the present bullish trend. As per CryptoQuant, since the advent of the price increase, there have been large inflows and outflows into exchanges. With over 31 million MATICs leaving exchanges as of this writing, the outflow was the overwhelming trend.</p>
          <h3>Introducing the Polygon domain</h3>
          <p>On 14 March, Polygon announced that it would partner with Unstoppable Web to introduce the Polygon domain. In addition to enabling users to create a portable identity across over 750 dApps, games, and metaverses, Polygon domains enable the creation of a digital identity. The Polygon domain could benefit the network in a manner akin to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).</p>
          <p>Given the outflow volume and Polygon’s bullish tendency, a further increase may be in store.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>MakerDAO has a new proposal to introduce a debt ceiling breaker.</li>
            <li>MKR has commenced a new bear run.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In a new emergency executive proposal, leading DeFi platform MakerDAO [MKR] has sought community approval to introduce a debt ceiling breaker for collateral assets used to mint its DAI stablecoin.</p>
          <p>This action became necessary after USD Coin [USDC] lost its parity with the U.S. dollar last weekend due to the disclosure that Circle, the issuer, held deposits at Silicon Valley Bank (SVIB). As USDC was a significant collateral backing for DAI, its de-pegging event resulted in a temporary loss of dollar parity for DAI.</p>
          <p>With this new proposal, the DeFi protocol aims to implement a mechanism to set the debt ceiling of any collateral type to zero on the Maker protocol.</p>
          <p>MakerDAO’s debt ceiling refers to the maximum number of DAI tokens that can be generated against the value of the collateral assets locked in the Maker protocol. The debt ceiling is set individually for each type of collateral the protocol accepts. The purpose of the debt ceiling is to maintain the stability of the MakerDAO system by limiting the number of DAI that can be issued,</p>
          <p>By introducing a debt ceiling breaker, MakerDAO aims to handle scenarios where the underlying collateral asset is experiencing substantial volatility. This mechanism would enable MakerDAO to safeguard its liquidity and prevent losses in such situations.</p>
          <h3>MKR demand falters, prices suffer</h3>
          <p>Because of its statistically significant positive correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], the growth in the king coin’s price following Federal Regulators’ decision to make all SVIB depositors whole resulted in a temporary price rally for MKR.</p>
          <p>However, the lack of new liquidity caused MKR’s price to decline, and stagnated the uptick. According to data from Santiment, the alt has experienced a decrease in network activity since the beginning of the week. For example, the count of daily active addresses trading MKR has since fallen by 86%. Likewise, new demand that might aid price growth has also dropped by 95% in the last four days.</p>
          <p>The token accumulation was evident on the daily chart at press time. However, it was not enough to initiate any significant price growth. As of this writing, MKR’s RSI rested above its centerline at 54.17, while its MFI, on an uptrend, was pegged at 41.</p>
          <p>A closer look at the asset’s MACD indicator revealed why there had been a price decline since the week started. The MACD line intersected with the trend line on 11 March, ushering in a new bear run, hence the downtrend.</p>

          <p>The recent turmoil in the U.S. banking industry has left crypto-companies searching high and low for new partner banks. Last week, Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank all shut down following regulatory intervention. This forced many users to move their assets elsewhere.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to find alternatives to these banks as their instant payment platforms were critical for transactions 24*7. According to many, the current regulatory environment in the U.S indicates it is not best suited for the growth of the crypto-space.</p>
          <h3>Experts share their two cents</h3>
          <p>Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood took to Twitter on 15 March to slam U.S. regulators for the banking crisis. According to the exec,</p>
          <p><b>“Instead of blocking decentralized, transparent, auditable and well-functioning financial platforms with no central points of failure, regulators should have been focused on the centralized and opaque points of failure looming in the traditional banking system.”</b></p>
          <p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently suggested that the crypto-industry has “already started moving outside” of the U.S. He claimed regulations put U.S. at “severe risk” of missing out on being an attractive hub for the evolution of crypto-innovation.</p>
          <h3>Crypto-firms hunt for substitute banks</h3>
          <p>Following the chaos, Circle hired Cross River Bank as its new partner and expanded ties with others.</p>
          <p>Additionally, according to reports, Digital Currency Group (DCG) is trying to find new banking partners for portfolio companies.</p>
          <p><b>“Santander (SAN), HSBC (HSBA), Deutsche Bank (DB), BankProv, Bridge Bank, Mercury, Multis and Series Financial are still willing to connect with crypto firms.”</b></p>
          <p>DCG has also reached out to international banks Revolut in UK, United Overseas Bank in Singapore, and Bank Leumi in Israel.</p>
          <p>At this point, many other crypto-firms are possibly looking to move overseas as well. As regulations in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore are crypto-friendly, they might see an influx of companies. These countries do not impose capital gains taxes on crypto as well, making it equally desirable for private investors.</p>
          <h3>Could there be a domino effect?</h3>
          <p>The latest in the series is crypto-bank Anchorage Digital announcing the layoffs of about 20% of its workforce, citing regulatory uncertainty in the United States.</p>
          <p>Anchorage further added that regulatory dynamics are creating headwinds for its business and the crypto-industry. It is likely that more banks will have to take harsh measures to prop up their businesses.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>U.S. government is arguing that $1 billion transaction made by Binance.US to purchase assets of Voyager should be placed on hold</li>
            <li>In order to file an appeal, a two-week delay on the court’s approval has been requested</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The plan by insolvent lender Voyager Digital to sell its digital assets to cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US includes a clause that would preclude U.S. authorities from bringing legal action against anyone connected to the sale.</p>
          <p>According to a motion filed by U.S. Trustee William Harrington and other government lawyers before a New York bankruptcy court, “the court improperly exceeded its statutory power” in authorizing the pardoning. In fact, they have asked for a two-week hold on the court’s approval of the transaction so that they could submit an appeal.</p>
          <h3>What does the Provision say?</h3>
          <p>The clause, which the court authorized on March 7 after finding that 97% of Voyager customers supported the idea, was designed to shield those involved in the sale from being held personally accountable for its implementation.</p>
          <p>Despite not objecting to other aspects of the proposed transaction, U.S. authorities claim the provision would make it more difficult for the government to “exercise its police and regulatory responsibilities.”</p>
          <p>The decision was made in response to an appeal from the U.S. Trustee, a division of the Department of Justice in charge of bankruptcy cases. The division is concerned that the agreement would essentially exonerate Voyager and its employees from violations of securities or tax laws.</p>
          <p>“The Court cannot tell the Government to speak now or forever hold its peace before Voyager and Binance.US are wed,” according to Damian Williams’ filing as U.S Attorney. Nothing in Bankruptcy Law allows courts to absolve parties from responsibility to the Government for actions taken in the past and in the future, it added.</p>
          <p>Williams argued that until appeals are resolved in higher courts, approval of the arrangement — or at least those portions that restrict the government’s capacity to execute the law — should be suspended.</p>
          <p>The sale was allowed last week by New York bankruptcy judge Michael Wiles. He had previously shown significant skepticism towards the Securities and Exchange Commission’s claims that Voyager’s VGX token would be unregistered securities.</p>
          <h3>What to expect?</h3>
          <p>On March 6, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) objected to the plan as well, citing the “extraordinary” and “highly improper” exculpation provision. The SEC claimed that Binance.US is running an unregistered securities exchange and that the repayment token would be an unregistered security offering.</p>
          <p>According to the most recent projections, the strategy is anticipated to result in the creditors of Voyager receiving about 73% of the value of their money back.</p>

            <li>Filecoin has launched its Filecoin Virtual Machine.</li>
            <li>The FVM has led to increased FIL trading in the last 24 hours.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To provide an execution environment for running the Ethereum [ETH] Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts on its network, leading decentralized storage network Filecoin [FIL] finally launched its Filecoin Virtual Machine [FVM] on the mainnet on 14 March.</p>
          <p>The launch of the FVM formed the final step of Filecoin’s Masterplan to bring large-scale computation and the ability to power web-scale apps to the decentralized storage network.</p>
          <p>According to the press release, the Filecoin Virtual Machine will provide similar abilities to Ethereum, allowing for the development and deployment of decentralized applications and the ability to connect with other blockchains.</p>
          <p>Following the launch of the FVM, leading cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced the integration of its web3 wallet with the upgrade.</p>
          <h3>Day traders rally toward FIL</h3>
          <p>In the last 24 hours, FIL’s price rallied by 7%. With a surge in FIL trading following the launch of the FVM, trading volume has climbed by 30% during the same period, per data from CoinMarketCap. As of this writing, the altcoin exchanged hands for $6.81 per FIL token.</p>
          <p>Taking advantage of the FVM launch, data obtained from Coinglass indicates that there has been an increase in the number of FIL trading positions opened within the past 24 hours. At $177.5 million at press time, FIL’s Open Interest has climbed by 2%.</p>
          <p>A jump in an asset’s Open Interest indicated that more traders were interested in taking positions in the asset. This often reflected a growing bullish sentiment toward that asset’s price.</p>
          <p>Moreso, there were a higher number of short liquidations than long liquidations in the last 24 hours. As the positive sentiment toward FIL continued to rise, data from Coinglass revealed.</p>
          <p>Further, on a 12-hour chart, FIL accumulation rallied significantly. FIL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) approached the overbought region at press time. The RSI was 60.99, while the MFI was 66.58. With weighted sentiment still in the positive territory per data from Santiment, this accumulation momentum is expected to be sustained. Therefore, more price growth should be on the horizon for FIL.</p>
          <p>Also, FIL’s On-balance volume (OBV) maintained an uptrend at press time, suggesting rallying token accumulation. When an asset’s OBV is trending upwards, it means that the volume of trades is heavier on the buy side, indicating that investors are more interested in buying the asset than selling it.</p>

            <li>Tether’s market cap dominated Circle, but earlier high sentiment has reduced.</li>

          <p>Over the weekend, stablecoins became “unstable” as fifth-ranked cryptocurrency as Circle USDC in market value lost its dollar peg. Following the event, a lot of investors switched sides and held their stables in Tether [USDT]. This led to a drop in USDC’s market capitalization and increased dominance for Tether.</p>
          <p>While many may have believed that USDT could act as a safe haven, not many trusted keeping them on exchanges. In fact, whales were the leading light in this group.</p>
          <h3>Whales keep stability to themselves</h3>
          <p>According to Santiment, about $1 billion USDT left exchanges and were moved into self-custody multiple times in the last ten days. This was an uncommon occurrence because the act had only happened eight times over the last 365 days before now.</p>
          <p>During the time Circle revealed its exposure, Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino, had assured the community that it had no links with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Regardless, USDC has found its way back to $1, although the price at press time was slightly below the expected value.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, USDT’s non-zero addresses decreased around 18 February. But, according to Glassnode, the number of unique addresses holding a positive amount of the stablecoin had increased to 4.15 million. This confirmed the restoration of the USDT’s superiority as USDC’s position in this aspect only had 1.59 million unique addresses.</p>
          <p>Moreso, one part of the USDT network that caught the eye was the velocity. An explanation of this metric is that it measures how many units of a coin are circulating in a network. It is derived by calculating dividing the on-chain transaction volume by the market capitalization.</p>
          <h3>High circulation but conviction is down</h3>
          <p>At press time, USDT surpassed the highs of the last ten months, as it peaked at 0.366. This value means that there has been a rapid increase in liquid supply. Therefore, the broader market was increasingly transacting using USDT. But for those who held a large supply, keeping off exchanges was the way to go.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the USDC troubles helped improve the perception towards USDT. This was because Santiment’s data showed that the latter’s stablecoin reached 6.628 on 12 March. The weighted sentiment compiles the public opinion about an asset.</p>
          <p>Hence, the hike implied that social volume was high and the feeling towards USDT was largely positive. However, press time data from the on-chain analytic platform revealed that the metric had been suppressed a bit.</p>
          <p>The supply percentage held by top addresses also trended along the downside. At press time, the chunk of these heavy-purse investors had decreased to 29.53.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Measured from the swing low at $0.0625, Dogecoin [DOGE] has made gains of close to 25% within the past five days. The sentiment across the crypto sphere was bullish following Bitcoin’s [BTC] sharp breakout past the $22k region on Monday.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin’s surge past $25.2k resistance on Tuesday meant it, too, had a strong bullish bias going forward. Dogecoin bulls might have to be wary- such a strong pump could see a large retracement before the next leg.</p>
          <h3>Two lower highs were breached and showed a shift in bias</h3>
          <p>The bearish breaker on the daily timeframe was breached in the opposite direction as Dogecoin reversed in dramatic fashion. The trading volume was high on the way up for DOGE, and the indicators also flashed bullish signals.</p>
          <p>The Awesome Oscillator was above the zero line and climbing, and showed intense bullish momentum. The Directional Movement Index also showed an uptrend in progress. Over the past few days, the -DI (red) was forced to retreat beneath the 20 mark and the +DI replaced it. With the ADX (yellow) also above 20, they showed a significant uptrend on the 4-hour chart.</p>
          <p>The market structure also corroborated with this finding. The price has breached two of the recent lower highs and flipped the previous bearish structure to bullish. The $0.073 level of support was retested almost perfectly before DOGE climbed higher yet again.</p>
          <p>The next area of resistance was at $0.08. This was an area that had served as support since mid-January. Hence, it was likely to be full of sellers. If this area was retested as support in the coming days, it could offer a buying opportunity.</p>
          <h3>The futures market showed capital flowing in alongside Dogecoin gains</h3>
          <p>The 15-minute chart showed periods of consolidation and expansion for Dogecoin on the lower timeframes over the past few days. Each pullback on the price chart saw the Open Interest decline.</p>
          <p>Similarly, each move upward for DOGE was accompanied by a surge in OI. Taken together, it showed bullish sentiment was strong in the market.</p>

          <p>Multiple dApps and DEXs on the Solana network have seen an uptick in activity over the last few days. However, this spike in activity on Solana may not be enough for the chain to take part in this bull run.</p>
          <p>The DEX in question would be Drift Protocol, with the same recording an ATH recently in terms of daily active users.</p>
          <p>Another dApp – Light Protocol –  witnessed an improvement in terms of activity on the Solana network.  The protocol verifies ZK SNARKs on the network. At press time, the protocol had managed to complete over 2 million transactions.</p>
          <p>Despite the success of Solana’s protocols, however, the overall TVL of the network declined. It fell from $281 million to $243.06 million over the past few weeks alone.</p>
          <p>The decline in Solana’s TVL was accompanied by a decline in interest for its NFTs. According to data from SolanaFloor, for instance, the protocol’s blue-chip NFTs struggled to grow over the last month. This contributed to a hike in the overall volume of NFTs sold on the protocol from $119,662 to $49,385.</p>
          <h3>Some more problems on the horizon?</h3>
          <p>The decline in NFT interest would be due to increasing negative sentiment that has been growing around Solana. With multiple downtimes and failures, many in the crypto-community have turned skeptical about the future of the Solana network.</p>
          <p>In fact, SOL has also suffered during this time period. According to Santiment’s data, the trading volume for SOL fell from 3.41 billion to 1.36 billion. The price volatility, however, continued to hike. Higher volatility would make many risk-averse traders shy away from buying SOL.</p>
          <p>However, development activity on the Solana network surged over the last few weeks. This spike in development activity suggested that the frequency with which developers on the Solana network have been contributing to its GitHub is high.</p>
          <p>This could imply that new updates and upgrades may be on their way for Solana in the future.</p>
          <p>However, the promise of new upgrades hasn’t been enough for traders to become optimistic about the future of Solana.</p>
          <p>In fact, according to Coinglass’ data, 52.08% of all trades against Solana have been short positions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin mixer – ChipMixer has been shut down by authorities, as per an announcement by Europol. The operation involved the collaboration of regulatory authorities from various countries. The operation also resulted in the seizure of four servers, over 1909.4 Bitcoins (BTC) – over $46.6 million (nearly EUR 44.2 million), and 7 TB of data.</p>
          <h3>Multiple agencies collaborate to bring down the Bitcoin mixer</h3>
          <p>United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigation, and Department of Justice took part in taking down the platform. Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office and General Prosecutors Office Frankfurt-Main also headed the operations. Others included Belgium’s Federal police, Poland’s Central Cybercrime Bureau, and Switzerland’s Cantonal Police of Zurich. The press release further said,</p>
          <p><b>“The ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.”</b></p>
          <p>Moreover, Europol claims that the Bitcoin mixer, launched in mid-2017, was used to launder over $2.87 billion in cryptocurrencies. A majority of this activity was related to markets in the darkweb, stolen cryptocurrencies, and illegal goods trafficking.</p>
          <p>Notably, ransomware groups like Mamba, Dharma, Zeppelin, and others have the Bitcoin mixer to launder illegally obtained funds. In addition, the regulatory authorities are investigating the platform’s possible association with the funds related to the now-bankrupt crypto exchange – FTX. The authorities are investigating whether the mixer was used by hackers to launder FTX’s funds, which totally amounted to $372 million. As per an on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, ChipMixer was used to launder 360 BTC of FTX’s funds.</p>
          <p>The Bitcoin mixer was also used by hackers to launder money stolen by Ronin Bridge, according to a report by Slowmist. Hackers had sent 26,021.89 BTC to Chipmixer. The same platform was used by Binance hackers in August 2019, with over 5,300 BTC sent for mixing.</p>
          <p>The current action has resulted in the shut down of the website. However, the authority has not announced any arrests related to the case. The press release further read,</p>
          <p><b>“Europol facilitated the information exchange between national authorities and supported the coordination of the operation. Europol also provided analytical support linking available data to various criminal cases within and outside the EU, and supported the investigation through operational analysis, crypto tracing, and forensic analysis.”</b></p>

            <li>ADA’s four-hour chart was bullish.</li>
            <li>The bulls had minimal leverage as per long vs. short positions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cardano [ADA] rebounded strongly after hitting its recent low of $0.3020 on 12 March. It saw aggressive buying at the above lows pushing its price break key resistances as Bitcoin [BTC] surged to the $26k area. </p>
          <p>However, BTC saw a sharp rejection at $26k and was operating below $25k at press time. Similarly, ADA hit the price ceiling at $0.368 and entered a retracement, pushing it into a key price range. As such, BTC’s price action will determine ADA’s price direction in the next few days/weeks.</p>
          <h3>ADA re-enters a previous short-term consolidation range</h3>
          <p>ADA had initially breached the $0.3306 – $0.3466 consolidation range during BTC’s extra rally after the February US CPI data release. The price rejection at $0.3679 set ADA back into the range. But the price action was in the upper range, suggesting a likely bullish breakout if BTC maintains the $24k level and surges.</p>
          <p>Therefore, ADA could swing between $0.3306 and $0.3466 before a possible breakout. A break of the range and a close above $0.3466 could tip near-term bulls to push the price toward the overhead resistance at $0.3679. But they must clear the hurdles at $0.3513 and $0.3605.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, ADA could witness intense selling pressure if the price closed below $0.3306. But the drop could slow down at the double bottom pattern’s neckline of $0.3200 or the previous low of $0.3020. These levels could be used as short-selling targets, especially if BTC witnessed a sharp retracement towards $20k. </p>
          <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) pulled back from an overbought territory and moved sideways, indicating buying pressure drop, but selling and buying pressure was almost equivalent at press time. Similarly, the Average Directional Index (ADX) sloped downwards, showing likely further retracement or consolidation for ADA. Given the RSI’s sideways movement, consolidation was highly likely. </p>
          <h3>Bulls have limited leverage in the short-term</h3>
          <p>Bulls had slight hope based on the ADA’s long/short ratio that showed slight leverage on the four-hour timeframe. It shows investors’ positive expectations in the short term. But bears and potential retracement could also not be overruled.</p>
          <p>In addition, ADA’s funding rate was positive across major exchanges, indicating the underlying bullish sentiment. But investors should track BTC’s price action to make more profitable moves.</p>

            <li>ETH sees surge in demand which may remain in the long term courtesy of deflationary milestone</li>
            <li>ETH shorts traders suffer as price pivots while demand for leverage recovers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ethereum’s EIP 1559 in August last year marked an important milestone for the network and ETH. The impact of that milestone is particularly evident in the fact that ETH is now deflationary.</p>
          <p>The latest Ethereum data reveals that the network has so far burned over 3 million ETH. The total amount of ETH burned is worth over $9.09 billion, trimming the post Merge total supply by slightly over 62,000 ETH. These findings underscore the progress that the Ethereum network has achieved so far as part of its PoS transition.</p>
          <h3>ETH’s race for sound money</h3>
          <p>ETH’s current 0.42% deflationary rate puts it well within the list of sound money. Why is this important? Well, traditional fiat money is currently feeling the weight of inflation which has been gradually causing the loss of value. As such, investors are eying asset classes that may allow them to protect their wealth from inflation.</p>
          <p>A deflationary asset such as ETH is currently more preferable both in the short and long-term. This is likely one of the reasons why the demand or ETH recently surged, resulting in significant recovery from the bearish performance we saw earlier this month.</p>
          <p>In fact, Glassnode’s data confirmed a surge in demand for the cryptocurrency. For instance – ETH’s exchange outflows volume just hit a new 3-month high. This is a sign that ETH traders have been aggressively buying the recent dip.</p>
          <p>The latest ETH exchange flow data confirmed that exchange outflows are back on the rise. A consequence of the robust buying pressure observed over the last few days, a period during which its price action bounced back strongly.</p>
          <p>The aforementioned surge was strong enough to push ETH back to a new YTD high. As a consequence, the retest of its previous resistance level yielded some sell pressure. Hence, the higher exchange inflows than outflows.</p>
          <h3>The state of ETH shorts, liquidations, and leverage</h3>
          <p>Shorts traders once anticipated further downside after the events of last month. However, the pivot on 9 March triggered a surge in liquidations and a shift to long positions.</p>
          <p>Demand for leverage has been declining since the end of February, likely due to concerns over market outcome in March. This has been an unsurprising outcome, one factoring the recent market events which made it more difficult to predict the next outcome.</p>
          <p>However, we have seen an uptick in demand for leverage over the last few days, with the same corresponding with the price surge.</p>
          <p>The market will likely feature more volatility if the level of leverage continues to rise. A higher likelihood of liquidations may lead to more wild swings.</p>

          <p>Authorities from Germany and the U.S. have seized up to 44 million euros ($46.3 million) from ChipMixer, a noted cryptocurrency mixer, according to the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol).</p>
          <p>The authorities took down the platform's infrastructure, seizing four servers, 7 terabytes of data and 1909.4 bitcoins (BTC) ($47.7 million), Europol said on Wednesday.</p>
          <p>The seizure was also supported by Belgium, Poland and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>ChipMixer laundered money for ransomware perpetrators, darknet markets, fraudsters and state-sponsored actors, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
          <p>One operator of ChipMixer, Minh Quốc Nguyễn, from Hanoi, Vietnam, was charged on Wednesday in Philadelphia with money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and identity theft, the DOJ said.</p>
          <p>The platform is believed to have enabled the laundering of 152,000 BTC – around $3.8 billion at current prices – since 2017, a large share of which was connected to ransomware groups, illicit goods trafficking and child sexual exploitation.</p>
          <p>According to the DOJ, activities enabled by ChipMixer include over $700 million in bitcoin associated with wallets designated as stolen funds, including those related to heists by North Korean cyber actors, and bitcoin used by the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to purchase infrastructure for Linux-based malware Drovorub.</p>
          <p>Mixing services gained increased prominence in August 2022 when Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for facilitating North Korea’s money-laundering operations. Shortly after that, Tornado Cash’s web developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested.</p>

          <h3><strong>From the Editor’s Desk</strong></h3>
          <p>Dear Reader,</p>
          <p>Predictions that things will get worse before they get better are commonplace among the punditocracy in their comments on virtually any subject one cares to name. But they’ve arguably become even more common in crypto than in other fields following the industry’s travails during the past year. So far, so unsurprising.</p>
          <p>The failure of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate, which had been widely expected since at least the beginning of this month, alongside the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, are very much of a piece with this narrative.</p>
          <p>The closure of the Silvergate Exchange Network and Signature Bank’s Signet, real-time payment platforms that allowed clients to move money into crypto around the clock, is already affecting crypto trade. The two services handled a huge chunk of fiat settlement for crypto, and their disappearance from the market is crimping liquidity, threatening to send transaction costs higher, at least in the short term.</p>
          <p>Where the darkest-before-the-dawn narrative starts to get interesting, though, involves what comes next. As we’ve seen, the crypto industry has an uncanny knack of finding creative ways out of tight spots, and in any case, it’s a sector that’s experiencing growing pains like any other as it moves through its teenage years and into adulthood.</p>
          <p>The banking system didn’t collapse during the global financial crisis 15 years ago when the titans of TradFi were shaken to their foundations, and neither will crypto as it loses some important players but finds others to take their place.</p>
          <p>The strife stirred up by Silvergate, SVB and Signature will pass, and, since nature abhors a vacuum, new providers of similar services will doubtless swoop in and fill the gap they leave in likely even more innovative ways.</p>
          <p>If there’s one thing that being in this industry should have taught all of us by now, it’s that nothing stays the same for long and that this frenetic pace of change is what keeps the sector at the cutting edge as it continues to shape the future of finance.</p>
          <p>We of course regret the trifecta of failures that have occurred in recent days. But long live disruption.</p>
          <p>Until the next time,</p>
          <p>Angie Lau,</p>
          <p>Founder and Editor-in-Chief</p>

          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-162-1.jpg" alt="NCX Stable genus" />
          <p>By the numbers: USDC — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.</p>
          <p>Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, regained parity with the U.S. dollar on Monday morning Asia time after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said it had taken over failed tech- and crypto-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and guaranteed its deposits to prevent a broader bank run.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>USDC fell as low as US$0.8774 on Saturday before recovering to US$0.999 around mid-morning Hong Kong time on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap data. It has mostly hovered around the US$0.997 mark since.</li>
            <li>USDC regained its peg after the FDIC said it had taken control of SVB on Sunday. Circle had held US$3.3 billion of deposits, accounting for around 8% of total USDC reserves, at the troubled bank.</li>
            <li>Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire said that USDC’s deposits held by SVB would be fully recoverable. Circle also announced a partnership with New Jersey-based Cross River Bank to enable the automated minting and redemption of USDC for customers starting on Monday.</li>
            <li>USDC started trading off its peg over the weekend after it was revealed that it held reserves at SVB, which had more than US$200 billion in assets and represents the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis of 2008.</li>
            <li>SVB and Signature Bank, two key lenders to the crypto industry, were both shut down and taken over by U.S. regulators to prevent systemic risk to the broader banking industry.</li>
            <li>“All depositors of [Signature Bank] will be made whole,” said a joint statement released by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. “​​As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.”</li>
            <li>USDC is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a US$38.4 billion market cap.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></h3>
          <p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was not due to its affiliations with crypto. But combined with the failure of Signature and Silvergate, its collapse has rattled the industry to its core.</p>
          <p>When Signature went down, it was revealed that Coinbase and Paxos, the issuer of Binance’s BUSD stablecoin, collectively had around US$500 million deposited in the bank. When Silicon Valley Bank called it a day, USDC issuer Circle had several billion dollars parked there.</p>
          <p>Although Circle acted quickly to reassure investors they wouldn’t lose their money, a bigger question arose: Is the crypto industry’s long-term viability reliant on regulators stepping in to clean up its messes?</p>
          <p>Since 2008, and before that, if we’re honest, central banks around the world have played a very visible role in backstopping the financial system and the economy more broadly when things have gone sideways. As the Covid pandemic brought much of the world to a halt, their huge injections of liquidity spared it an even worse fate than it ended up suffering. That may have been a rescue that was always guaranteed. Crypto has no such luxury.</p>
          <p>Circle may have handled its Silicon Valley problem adroitly, but would Tether fare so well in similar circumstances? Tether appears to be only skimpily regulated in the U.S., yet its market cap is nearly twice that of USDC. If it gets into trouble, there are few people it can turn to for help.</p>
          <p>When Terra collapsed last year, no central authority was willing to pick up the bill. If crypto wants to be taken seriously, its “safest” assets must be made safer than they currently are.</p>
          <h3><strong>2.Gate carsh</strong></h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-162-3.jpg" alt="NCX Gate crash" />
          <p>By the numbers: Silvergate — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.</p>
          <p>California-based, crypto-focused lender Silvergate Bank is being wound up by its parent company, Silvergate Capital, becoming another victim of last year’s collapse of crypto exchange FTX.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Silvergate Capital will shut down the bank’s operations and liquidate it in an orderly manner, offering full repayments to all depositors, according to a company announcement.</li>
            <li>Unlike the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, Silvergate’s shutdown has not involved intervention by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</li>
            <li>As a federally insured bank, Silvergate provided banking services to the crypto industry. In 2017, it rolled out its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a 24/7 payment network allowing instantaneous fiat transactions between crypto exchanges and their customers.</li>
            <li>The bank was hit hard by the collapse of FTX in November 2022, with its non-interest-bearing deposits slumping from US$12.1 billion on Sept. 30 to US$3.9 billion on Dec. 31, a dive of more than 67%, according to a Silvergate quarterly report.</li>
            <li>Silvergate reported a US$1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 and had laid off 40% of its staff by Jan. 5 this year. It is also being probed by U.S. prosecutors over its links to Alameda Research, FTX’s trading arm.</li>
            <li>On March 1, Silvergate Capital announced in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it was evaluating “its ability to continue as a going concern.” and it discontinued its SEN service on March 3.</li>
            <li>The crypto market has felt the absence of SEN, which Silvergate said had handled around US$563.3 billion of U.S. dollar transfers last year. On some U.S. crypto exchanges, Bitcoin-to-dollar and Bitcoin-to-Tether transactions dropped between 35% and 45% between the beginning of the month and March 11, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.</li>
            <li>At the same time, U.S.-based crypto exchanges are seeking alternatives for banking services, with Kraken set to launch its own bank in the state of Wyoming, aiming to offer “a more seamless integration between crypto and the traditional financial system”.</li>
            <li>Silvergate’s stock was trading at US$2.21 at press time, down more than 80% from its opening price on March 1, according to data from Yahoo Finance.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></h3>
          <p>Crypto users could be forgiven for feeling un-banked in the U.S., especially when it comes to 24/7 payments. The loss of Silvergate’s seamless off-ramp has meant crypto companies have been forced to find alternative means of transacting with traditional finance.</p>
          <p>A stark illustration of this came in the form of Circle’s weekend announcement that it would cover any losses related to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, but that investors would have to wait until banks opened on Monday before they could withdraw their funds.</p>
          <p>This is a profound development affecting one of crypto’s key features: markets that never close and the ability to cash out anytime. It’s a problem being felt by other companies, too.</p>
          <p>Crypto.com and Binance are having to find new off-ramps for the euro and British pound after banking partners pulled out of crypto. While businesses are exploring other options, and new companies gear up to meet their needs, cryptocurrencies look more isolated from the rest of the finance sector.</p>
          <p>This is likely to continue as regulators scrutinize the balance sheets of businesses offering services to the industry. It ought to be beneficial for consumers in the long run, but for now, it leaves crypto with fewer friends in TradFi.</p>
          <h3><strong>3.Regulatory consolidation</strong></h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-162-4.jpg" alt="NCX Regulatory consolidation" />
          <p>China has passed a plan to establish a new national financial regulator, replacing the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, according to state-run news outlet CGTN. The move was part of an overhaul of State Council institutions announced at the annual “two sessions” meetings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference last Friday.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The new regulatory administration will be set up directly under the State Council. Aside from replacing the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), it will also consolidate certain functions of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The new regulator’s official name has not yet been revealed.</li>
            <li>Financial regulation in China has up to now been the preserve of the CBIRC, the PBOC and the CSRC, whose functions have at times overlapped. Following the reform, the respective responsibilities of PBOC and CSRC to protect consumers and investors will be shifted to the regulator, which will supervise most of the country’s financial activities, apart from the securities sector.</li>
            <li>The reform will further centralize China’s supervision of its finance sector and comes as part of an overall consolidation of political power in the country.</li>
            <li>“China’s regulatory reforms will strengthen regulators’ capability to establish and enforce a unified regulatory framework, as well as reduce the room for regulatory arbitrage,” CNBC reported Moody’s Investors Service Vice President David Yin as having said in a note.</li>
            <li>The reform plan follows President Xi Jinping’s warning in February about three “systemic risks” in China’s economy: risks to the real estate sector, financial risks and local government debt risks.</li></ul>
          <li>The plan does not give much indication of how crypto assets will be regulated. According to a PBOC notice dated September 2021 that announced China’s blanket ban on cryptocurrency transactions, the CBIRC, the PBOC and the CSRC were together responsible for curbing crypto speculation to safeguard financial stability.</li>
          <h3><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></h3>
          <p>Beijing’s announcement of a new financial regulator shows the extent to which it is poised to charge ahead with its Digital China strategy while ramping up efforts to identify and weed out perceived risks to the country’s financial system.</p>
          <p>When China banned cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, 10 regulators — including the  China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the People’s Bank of China and the China Securities Regulatory Commission — pointed to crypto as a risk and announced a ban in a joint notice. There have been some overlaps in oversight responsibilities among the three authorities, but now, with the establishment of the new regulator, currently informally known as “the National Financial Regulatory Administration,” the reshuffle is expected to clarify regulatory power and functions.</p>
          <p>According to analysts at Citic Securities and Guotai Junan Securities, cited in a report by business media outlet Caixin Global, the top-level realignment aims to spell out the regulatory relationship between monetary policy and financial consumer protection.</p>
          <p>When it comes to consumer protection, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Tuesday released a report showing a growing number of complaints associated with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Last year, NFT buyers in China flooded SAMR with gripes about scams and price manipulation, with official complaints skyrocketing 30,000% to 59,700 from just 198 the previous year.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, China appears determined to develop and oversee the industries contributing to its digital economy by setting up a national data bureau. That makes sense, as a big chunk of the nation’s economy depends on its digital industries. A government “work report” submitted on March 5 to the country’s rubber-stamp legislature showed that the value-added output of new industries and businesses in the country’s digital economy accounted for more than 17% of gross domestic product.</p>
          <p>It remains to be seen how the new financial regulator will approach NFTs, which in China have frequently involved fraud and wild speculation, and how it and other authorities will strike a balance between encouraging digital innovation and ramped-up regulatory scrutiny. But what’s more certain following the heavily politically loaded meetings that wrapped up a few days ago is that however China’s digital future takes shape, it may well look even more centralized under the Communist Party’s control than it already is.</p>

          <p><strong>In this article:</strong></p>
          <p>KuCoin Ventures, the venture arm of China-focused (but Seychelles-registered) crypto exchange KuCoin, led a $10 million funding round into the stablecoin issuer behind CNHC, a stablecoin pegged to the value of the offshore yuan.</p>
          <p>CNHC is pegged 1:1 with the offshore yuan, known by its abbreviation CNH to differentiate it from China’s onshore yuan, which goes by CNY. Reserves for the CNH are kept at a Hong Kong depository institution.</p>
          <p>“This investment in CNHC is part of KuCoin Ventures' broader strategy of investing in the Web3 infrastructure in the APAC region,” Justin Chou, chief investment officer of KuCoin and lead at KuCoin Ventures, said in a statement. “Hong Kong has a well-established traditional finance ecosystem. With the regulation and new policy for next-generation digital assets, Hong Kong has a real opportunity at becoming the new crypto center of the world.”</p>
          <p>CNHC is issued on both Ethereum and Conflux. On-chain data shows that Ethereum has 23 holders of the token and 102 transfers, while Conflux has 606 holders and 1,487 transfers.</p>
          <p>Fan Long, co-founder of Conflux, said Conflux is capturing the majority of the volume here because of Conflux’s “regulatory compliance” in China.</p>
          <p>“The significance of CNHC stems from its capacity to connect traditional financial systems with the emerging Web3 landscape, especially amid heightened regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “CNHC presents a practical alternative for businesses and users in search of compliant options beyond the U.S.-centric regulatory framework.”</p>
          <h3><strong>Hunting for a dollar alternative</strong></h3>
          <p>Stablecoins are overwhelmingly backed by the U.S. dollar. While there are stablecoins based on other world currencies such as the euro, pound, or other dollars like the Australian, Canadian or Singaporean variety, none come close to touching the volume of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins including USDT and USDC.</p>
          <p>On one hand, this has only re-enforced U.S. dollar hegemony. The next frontier of finance being denominated in dollars is largely a good thing as it extends U.S. rule making, CoinDesk columnists have argued.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, not everyone wants to follow U.S. rules, especially when they have no nexus to the country. Regulators in the U.S. are also hesitant to allow crypto full-fettered access to the American banking system until stringent federal oversight is established.</p>
          <p>The market itself is not a fan of the U.S.-centric concentration risk this presents. USDC, knocked off its peg for multiple days during the crypto banking crisis, only recently regained it but the smart money is skeptical.</p>
          <p>BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes thinks the answer to all of this is a bitcoin derivatives-based algorithmic stablecoin called the kakaDollar, though the market might be skeptical of the concept after the collapse of Terra last year.</p>
          <p>There’s certainly been a successful use case for the CNH in China’s offshore bond market, for bwhich it was built. But crypto is something else entirely.</p>
          <p>It’s not without its skeptics.</p>
          <p>Alex Liu, CEO of Taipei-based Maicoin, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk the RMB is too tightly controlled on- or offshore for it to work out.</p>
          <p>“I think the only real challenge for the U.S. dollar is the RMB. But not through crypto, and not through China’s CBDC,” he said, referring to a central bank digital currency. He said the real focus is oil traded in RMB-denominated contracts. “Most trade between Russia and China has been de-dollarized,” he said.</p>

The rise in cryptocurrencies accompanied a rebound in U.S. equities on Tuesday as concern about bank failures receded and February inflation data released the same day was in line with expectations.</p>
          <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin rose 2.10% in the past 24 hours to US$24,789 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, for a weekly gain of 11.39%. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly broke the US$26,000 ceiling on Tuesday evening in Asia and is now up almost 50% for the year to date.</li>
            <li>Ether gained 1.90% to US$1,706, rising 8.86% in the past seven days.</li>
            <li>Solana led the gainers in the top 10, adding 2.75% to US$20.93 for a rise of 3.12% for the week. The Solana Foundation introduced Ask Solana U on Tuesday, an AI-powered chat-like engine that aims to assist Web3 developers on the Solana blockchain.</li>
            <li>Dogecoin rose 2.74% to US$0.07478. The memecoin is up 0.85% for the seven-day period, but still down more than 7% from the beginning of March.</li>
            <li>XRP edged 0.54% higher to trade at US$0.3735, but is the only top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrency with a weekly loss, down 2.20%. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs whose payment network is powered by XRP,  tweeted on Monday that Ripple had some exposure to the failed Silicon Valley Bank. This was accompanied by a large flow of XRP transactions on the same day, according to crypto tracker Whale Alert.</li>
            <li>Crypto exchange Binance’s BNB rose 0.51% to US$309.51, posting a weekly gain of 6.88%. The world’s largest crypto exchange on Tuesday said it will halt its U.K. pound deposits and withdrawals by May this year, after its local partner for fiat on- and off-ramps said it was ending the service due to regulatory concerns.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 1.30% in the past 24 hours to US$1.09 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours gained 8.47% to US$101.54 billion.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities closed higher on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.06%, the S&P 500 moved up 1.65% and the Nasdaq Composite Index posted the biggest gain of 2.14%.</li>
            <li>Efforts by U.S. regulators and President Joe Biden to calm markets seemed to have the desired effect after the collapses of U.S. banks at the weekend. First Republic Bank, which slid over 60% on Monday and was briefly suspended from trading, bounced back almost 27% on Tuesday, according to CNBC.</li>
            <li>Investors in U.S. equities and cryptocurrencies also gained some reassurance from the U.S. Labor Department’s February inflation report released Tuesday, which showed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.6% by month and 6% on year, all in line with expectations. Though still above the Federal Reserve’s stated goal to keep annual inflation below 2%, the data suggest inflation in the U.S. is moderating and may convince the Fed to ease back on interest rate hikes.</li>
            <li>After a raft of rate hikes last year and into 2023, U.S. interest rates are now between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 79.7% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this month. The chance of no rate increase is at 20.3%, a decrease from 35% on Tuesday.</li>

          <h3><strong>In this article:</strong></h3>
          <p>RockX, a Singapore-based blockchain company, is looking to attract institutional investors to liquid staking with its new service, Bedrock.</p>
          <p>As well as offering staking services to retail customers, Bedrock offers institutional-grade know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance to institutions looking to stake more than 32 ether (ETH)($57,000), RockX said in an email Wednesday.</p>
          <p>The company is initially targeting exchanges and wealth management platforms, with a view to attracting large funds and banking institutions further down the line, founder and CEO Chen Zhuling told CoinDesk in an interview. Crypto trading firm Amber Group, a RockX investor, will be one of Bedrock's first clients.</p>
          <p>Staking is a means of earning yield on digital assets, in which crypto holders can lock up their tokens to secure proof-of-stake blockchains in exchange for a reward. With liquid staking, investors keep their capital liquid and use their staked tokens as collateral by receiving derivatives.</p>
          <p>Last month, liquid staking became the second-largest crypto sector when its total value of assets locked reached $14.1 billion, surpassing the $13.7 billion held on decentralized lending and borrowing protocols. Liquid staking platform Lido Finance has become decentralized finance's largest protocol with about $10 billion worth of digital assets locked on the platform.</p>
          <p>The catalyst for liquid staking is the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade, which will allow stakers to withdraw the ether (ETH) they have staked and for which they have accumulated rewards. The expectation is Shanghai will strengthen ETH by establishing a blueprint for staking protocols and give users more confidence in their sovereignty over their assets.</p>
          <p>However, there have been doubts cast on the appetite for liquid staking among financial institutions, particularly in the Asian market closest to RockX. David Cicoria, head of markets technology for digital asset custodian Hex Trust, recently said institutions are giving it a miss due to risks of depegging, hacks and lack of regulatory clarity.</p>
          <p>Zhuling agreed institutions do hold some of these concerns, but stressed the important distinction between custodial and non-custodial staking services. Bedrock falls under the latter.</p>
          <p>"We are not holding any ETH at all. All the ETH is held in a smart contract and then deployed to validators," he said.</p>
          <p>"It's very easy to tally how many coins are held in the pool and thence being passed on to validators, so there is no risk of inflation of the numbers or misappropriation of assets," he added.</p>

          <p>Bitfinex and Binance are walking back technical support for Stargate Finance’s plans to reissue its stargate (STG) tokens, according to several announcements that came out this week. They will now promote the use of the protocol’s original STG tokens.</p>
          <p>The crypto exchanges’ decision to eliminate support for the new STG tokens follows Stargate decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) decision on Tuesday to pump the brakes on its plan to mint new tokens, according to a recent community proposal. At the time of that decision Stargate Finance had already begun disseminating the new STG tokens, according to data from Etherscan – a problem with which exchanges must now contend to eliminate security risks to STG token holders.</p>
          <p>StargateDAO initially voted in favor of reissuing all STG tokens by March 15 after it uncovered security risks posed by “illegitimate STG transfers from compromised Alameda wallets,” referring to the failed crypto trading firm where roughly 10% of STG tokens are held. However, the DAO abandoned those plans when liquidators of FTX, Alameda’s sister company, rebuked the plan, arguing it violated an automatic stay issued in the FTX bankruptcy case.</p>
          <p>"[The reissuance] was to try to help the safety of the tokens in question. This is now being challenged with the liquidators clearly not wanting them moved," StargateDAO’s latest proposal to unwind the token’s reissuance reads.</p>
          <p>As a result, Bitfinex and Binance are now revoking scheduled STG contract swaps on various blockchains. They have also taken steps to ascertain whether their users who have STG holdings are, in fact, holding original STG tokens and not reissued tokens.</p>
          <p>Bitfinex provided its users with a contract address on the Ethereum network against which they could check the validity of their STG tokens.</p>
          <p>"We would like to remind our customers that there are STG tokens with different contract addresses in circulation; therefore, please don't send any STG tokens to our platform other than the one with the above contract address to avoid losing funds," Bitfinex said in its post about the canceled reissuance.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Binance pledged to "swap [users’] new STG tokens back to old STG tokens" to mitigate security risks associated with the use of the new STG tokens.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger, House Committee on Financial Services Chair Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), says the legislation could be passed in just a few days, hinting that the delay was due to concerns over which political party would be in control of the House of Representatives.</p>
          <p>"The only thing that interfered, I think, with its passage was the anticipation that the house was going to change and it was going to be in the hands of the Republicans and they should take charge rather than those of us on the Democratic side," said Ranking Member Waters.</p>
          <p>Rep. Waters declined to give a timetable for the legislation, though she did reaffirm that she and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), are focused on stablecoin legislation and have bipartisan support to get it done.</p>

USDC had momentarily lost its peg to the U.S. dollar after the shutdown of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) but recovered after Circle, its issuer, announced a new partnership with Cross River Bank.</li>
            <li>“We expect the stress in the banking sector, and the wider impact on confidence, now will give the central bank [U.S. Federal Reserve] cause for pause on its rate hike program,” said Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group.</li>

            <li>All Asian equity markets dropped on Tuesday as investors braced for the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 2.27%, while South Korea’s Kospi fell 2.56% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 declined 2.19%.</li>
            <li>The Shanghai Composite lost 0.72% while the Shenzhen Component Index dropped 0.77%, despite China announcing it will resume issuing visas from March 15 as it eased its Covid-zero policy. Investors are also looking forward to a series of China’s economic indicators expected to be published on Wednesday.</li>
            <li>Investors also await U.S. inflation data later on Tuesday. The February consumer price index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, is expected at 6% on year, dropping from the 6.4% for the year that ended January 2023, but still well above the U.S. central bank’s 2% target.</li>
            <li>“Despite most warning signs flashing red, the U.S. has continued to defy gravity,” said Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at Schroders. “We still think that higher interest rates, which we now expect to peak at 5.25% in the second quarter of 2023, will lead to a recession. However, it is likely to be relatively short and shallow.”</li>
            <li>The Forkast NFT 500 index rose 0.7% to 4,064.39. Planet IX – Gravity Grade rallied 51.67% as the day’s biggest gainer, followed by EGoldMiner that strengthened 44.63%.</li>
            <li>European stocks traded slightly higher after a two-day sell-off. The STOXX 600 inched up 0.1% and Germany’s DAX 40 rose 0.53%, while Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.32% to a two-month low, as investors assessed spillover effects from the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank.</li>

          <p>Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schonberger joins the Live show to discuss Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte’s call on Congress for the urgent approval of stablecoin regulation.</p>
          <p>RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, turning now to Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger, who's been following this story all day and has more on this. Hey, Jennifer.</p>
          <p>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Hey there, Rachelle. That's right. Just spoke with Circle's Chief Policy Officer and Head of Strategy Dante Disparte, who is urgently calling on Congress to pass legislation to regulate stablecoins in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure that led their stablecoin to break the buck.</p>
          <p>In a conversation just moments ago, Disparte saying that he favors legislation from House Financial Services Committee Chair and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters. Disparte telling me, quote, "I have been uploading to the internet since 2019. And since 2019, there has been an ongoing persistent conversation about risk. And we've been met with complete inaction."</p>
          <p>"I do think if this is the digital assets Dodd-Frank moment, then it is the time to act. Just as it took 2008 to get comprehensive banking reforms, I think it's well past time that the US acts. And to act is not to ban innovation, it's to encourage responsible innovation. But there is a shortfall in action right now"</p>
          <p>Now, Disparte also told me it was a run on a bank that triggered a loss of confidence in a fully reserved digital dollar. He says, that's the irony. Whereas, with the Tarra LUNA blowup, he called that financial alchemy of the very worst kind. He says, the way Circle operates is more conservative than the Paypals of the world, and it was a loss in confidence in a bank that triggered a crisis and risk in Circle's business.</p>
          <p>Now, Circle's stablecoin broke the buck after it revealed that it had a $3.3 billion in reserves tied up in Silicon Valley Bank, causing investors to dump the stablecoin. Circle pledged from its balance sheet over the weekend to make any holder whole If the bank didn't go through an orderly wind down. And that helped to restore that deep peg on the chain.</p>
          <p>Circle holds 80% of its reserves in short term treasuries and 20% in cash. As a depositor of Silicon Valley Bank, Circle will be made whole by the FDIC. Now, Rachelle, Disparte told me that there is a serious policy conversation that needs to be had here. And that regulators' intervention over the weekend was the right move to stave off contagion. I will have more on our website on finance.yahoo.com. Rachelle.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, lost and then regained parity to the U.S. dollar after regulators took over the failed Silicon Valley Bank and guaranteed deposits, including Circle’s, to prevent a broader run on the banking industry.</p>
          <p>USDC was trading at US$0.9948 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong on Monday, after falling to as low as US$0.8774 on Saturday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Circle held about US$3.3 billion in USDC reserve deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, known as SVB.</p>
          <p>Cryptocurrencies also bounced back from losses last week, with Bitcoin jumping almost 10% in early trading in Asia, after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – a government body set up after the 1930s Great Depression to provide deposit insurance at savings and commercial banks – said on Sunday that it has taken over SVB.</p>
          <p>The move to backstop SVB, which had total deposits of more than US$175 billion, went all the way up to the White House and President Joe Biden for approval at the weekend, according to a joint statement by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, indicating the seriousness with which U.S. regulators took the threat of bank failures spreading.</p>
          <p>The fall of SVB followed the earlier collapse of another California-based and crypto-linked bank Silvergate Capital last week. The FDIC said Sunday it has also taken control of New York-based Signature Bank, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto industry, due to banking industry risk.</p>
          <p>“Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,” the joint official statement said.</p>
          <p>“We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.”</p>
          <p><strong>Circle</strong></p>
          <p>Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO of Circle, said in a statement dated March 12 in Boston, U.S.: “We are heartened to see the U.S. government and financial regulators take crucial steps to mitigate risks extending from the banking system.”</p>
          <p>Allaire said the US$3.3 billion in USDC reserve deposits held at Silicon Valley Bank “will be fully available when U.S. banks open tomorrow morning. No USDC cash reserves were held at Signature Bank. As a regulated payment token, USDC remains redeemable 1:1 with the U.S. Dollar.”</p>
          <p>FDIC data shows SVB had about US$209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, making it the biggest bank failure in the U.S. since the 2008 financial crisis that included the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a 158-year old investment bank that is the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history with more than US$600 billion in liabilities.</p>
          <p>The FDIC in its Sunday statement said all insured depositors at SVB will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning in the U.S. and that the FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week.</p>
          <p>“As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors,” the federal agency said.</p>
          <p><strong>Crypto link?</strong></p>
          <p>New York-based Signature Bank was closed down on Sunday by its state chartering authority, with the FDIC appointed as receiver. At the end of last year, Signature Bank held total assets of around US$110.36 billion with US$88.59 billion in deposits, according to the FDIC.</p>
          <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted on Monday morning in Asia that the firm had about US$240 million in corporate cash at Signature as of Friday, and it is currently facilitating all client cash transactions with other banking partners.</p>
          <p>The U.S. bank failures could be seen as contagion from the crypto industry, but “the collapses of Silvergate and SVB didn’t appear to have direct links with cryptocurrency,” Winston Hsiao, co-founder and chief revenue officer of Taipei-based fiat-crypto exchange XREX, wrote on Sunday in a Facebook post.</p>
          <p>“Crypto firms are actually victims just like many corporates and individuals that deposited at the two banks,” he said.</p>
          <p>US President Joe Biden on Twitter said he is “firmly committed” to holding those responsible for the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapse “fully accountable.”</p>

          <p>Bitcoin and Ether led a strong price rebound in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies in morning trading in Asia as U.S. banking regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, both with ties to the crypto industry, and guaranteed deposits at the institutions as well as additional backstops for the banking industry. The moves followed the failure of Silvergate Capital last week that raised the threat of a systemic run on banks. Solana led the gains.</p>
          <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin jumped 9.60% in the past 24 hours to US$22,601 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether gained 9.77% to US$1,621.</li>
            <li>Solana surged 12.85% to US$20.38 to lead the gainers, but still has more ground to make up as it’s down 2.93% over the past seven days.</li>
            <li>USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization, traded back in line with its U.S. dollar peg in the Asia Monday morning after briefly losing the peg following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank where it holds about US$3 billion in deposits, according to Circle, the issuer of USDC.</li>
            <li>USDC fell to US$0.8774 on Saturday and its market cap slumped 15% to US$36 billion from US$43 billion. Circle said the same day the company had the funds to back USDC and it would remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. dollar. USDC recently traded at US$0.9941.</li>
            <li>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Monday that all Circle deposits will be available when banks open on Monday.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 6.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.01 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours was down 34.52% to US$60.19 billion.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities slid on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.07%, the S&P 500 fell 1.45% and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.76%.</li>
            <li>The slump in equities followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by the FDIC on Friday, in the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. However, U.S. stock futures were trading higher on Monday morning in Asia, reflecting the moves to backstop the U.S. banking industry.</li>
            <li>Amid the banking scares, investors had to contend with the job report from the Labor Department on Friday that showed February nonfarm payrolls came in at  311,000, beating the projected 225,000. This furthers the narrative that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates more than previously expected to curb inflation.</li>
            <li>However, with banking failures now the center of attention and concern, analysts at the CME Group predict a 17.4% chance of a 50 basis point hike this month, a sharp drop from 60.9% last Friday. This reflects a view the Fed is unlikely to raise rates by that much in the middle of a series of bank failures.</li>
            <li>CME expect a 82.6% chance the Fed will raise rates by the forecasted 25 basis points this month, but other commentators say the Fed may postpone any hike until next month because of the banking industry jitters.</li>
            <li>The Fed meets on March 22 to make its next decision on interest rates, which are currently between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007.</li>
            <li>The U.S. annual inflation rate is 6.4% for the year ended January 2023, according to Labor Department data released on Feb. 14, which is well above the Fed’s long-term goal to keep inflation in a 2% band. The next inflation update is scheduled for March 14 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.</li>

          <p>(Bloomberg) -- The second-largest stablecoin in crypto fell from its intended $1 peg on Saturday, trading as low as 81.5 cents, hurt by the exposure of issuer Circle Internet Financial Ltd. to the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
          <p>USD Coin, or USDC, is a key plank of crypto markets and is supposed to hold a constant $1 value, fully backed by reserves of cash and short-dated Treasuries. But $3.3 billion of that roughly $40 billion stockpile is with Silicon Valley Bank, which has just become one of the largest US bank failures in recent history.</p>
          <p>Regulators seized the bank on Friday and investors are awaiting more clarity on the return of deposits. In that vacuum, USDC fell below $1, trading at about 92 cents as of 9:02 a.m. in London on Saturday. Smaller stablecoins such as DAI and Pax Dollar also fell from their pegs, a sign of wider nervousness.</p>
          <p>The worries haven’t so far spread to top stablecoin Tether, which held at $1. Tether has previously faced scrutiny over its reserves. Wider crypto markets are having a painful week and were on the back foot Saturday: Bitcoin oscillated between gains and losses, while smaller tokens like Solana and Avalanche were in the red.</p>
          <p>Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte described the fall of Silicon Valley Bank as a “black swan failure” in the US financial system, saying in a tweet that without a federal rescue plan there would be “broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs.”</p>
          <p>USDC has a circulating supply of about 41 billion tokens and a market value of roughly $37 billion, CoinGecko data shows. A net $2 billion of USDC was redeemed in the past 24 hours, according to blockchain research firm Nansen. Data compiled by Bloomberg indicated USDC traded as low as 81.5 cents.</p>
          <p>Coinbase’s Step</p>
          <p>Stablecoins like USDC are intended to hold a set value against another, highly liquid asset like the US dollar. They come in a variety of forms and some, like Circle’s, are underpinned by reserves of cash and bonds. Investors often park funds in stablecoins as they move between crypto trades.</p>
          <p>As the selloff in USDC worsened, US-based crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. said it would be “temporarily pausing” the conversion of USDC into US dollars during the weekend, and would resume on Monday when banks open.</p>
          <p>The fall in USDC has had a knock-on effect on decentralized finance applications which let users trade, borrow and lend coins and which tend to rely heavily on trading pairs involving the stablecoin.</p>
          <p>“Unless there’s a concrete bailout plan this weekend, I think markets will be ugly again next week,” said Teong Hng, chief executive officer at crypto investment firm Satori Research, about the failure of SVB.</p>
          <p>Crypto’s Woes</p>
          <p>The crypto sector was already reeling from a prolonged rout that’s knocked $2 trillion off the value of digital assets since November 2021, precipitating a series of implosions such as the TerraUSD stablecoin, the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund and the FTX exchange.</p>
          <p>The TerraUSD token — known as UST — tried to use a mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving a sister token, Luna, to hold its value. The $60 billion wipeout of that system intensified global regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins.</p>
          <p>“I think the market ‘panic priced’ USDC like it priced USDT around the Luna collapse,” said Haohan Xu, chief executive officer of Apifiny, an institutional trading platform. “It’s driven by Circle’s exposure at SVB plus Coinbase closing off its USDC convert function.”</p>
          <p>Trying to Reassure</p>
          <p>Crypto firms including Binance and Tether on Friday used Twitter to try to reassure their customers about any risks posed by the failed bank.</p>
          <p>Changpeng Zhao, chief executive officer at Binance, the largest digital-asset exchange, tweeted that the firm doesn’t have exposure and its funds are safe.</p>
          <p>Paxos Trust Co., issuer of Pax Dollar, and crypto exchange Gemini said they have no relationship with the bank, according to statements on their official Twitter accounts. Tether’s Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in a tweet that the largest stablecoin doesn’t have exposure to SVB.</p>
          <p>By contrast, bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi has about $227 million in an account at the failed bank, according to a court filing.</p>

          <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) lost its dollar peg and slumped to an all-time low on Saturday before recovering most of its losses after Circle, the firm behind it, assured investors it would honor the peg despite exposure to failed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
          <p>Circle said in a tweet on Friday it has $3.3 billion of its $40 billion of USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank. On Saturday, the cryptocurrency company said in a blog post that USDC liquidity operations will resume as normal when banks open on Monday morning in the United States.</p>
          <p>"As a regulated payment token, USDC will remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar", the company said in a blog post.</p>
          <p>The cryptocurrency firm said that in the event the bank does not return 100% of deposits, it will cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.</p>
          <p>The coin, which broke its 1:1 dollar peg and fell as low as $0.88 shortly after 0800 GMT (3 a.m. EST) on Saturday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, recovered to trade around $0.97 by 2100 GMT.</p>
          <p>Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on Friday in the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, roiling global markets and stranding billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors.</p>
          <p>Circle said in a tweet on Friday that the company and USDC "continue to operate normally" while the firm waits for clarity on what will happen to Silicon Valley Bank depositors.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase said in a tweet it was not allowing USDC to be exchanged for U.S. dollars over the weekend while banks are closed, citing "heightened activity", while it plans to resume swaps on Monday.</p>
          <p>Joseph Edwards, investment advisor at Enigma Securities, said the situation was "extremely serious" for USDC.</p>
          <p>"No matter how sound Circle's operations are, this sort of depeg on a stablecoin tends to fundamentally undermine confidence in it," Edwards said.</p>
          <p>"The short-term implications here are dramatic and unknowable, especially once systems start to have to be adjusted to the reality that 1 USDC isn't trading at 1 USD for the time being."</p>
          <p>CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE</p>
          <p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a constant exchange rate with "fiat" currencies - those backed by a central government rather than a physical commodity such as gold - for example through a 1:1 U.S. dollar peg.</p>
          <p>Used in cryptocurrency trading, they have surged in value in recent years. USDC is the second-biggest stablecoin with a market cap of $37 billion. The largest, Tether, has a market cap of $72 billion, according to CoinGecko.</p>
          <p>USDC's price usually holds close to $1, making Saturday's drop unprecedented. According to CoinGecko data, its previous all-time low was around $0.97 in 2018, though in 2022 it fell just below $0.99 when cryptocurrency markets were roiled by the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.</p>
          <p>Traders have been on guard this week for signs of contagion in the financial sector and beyond from troubles for Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-focused Silvergate, which this week disclosed plans to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate.</p>
          <p>Boston-based Circle said last week it had moved a "small percentage" of USDC reserve deposits held at Silvergate to its other banking partners.</p>
          <p>The chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet on Friday it had no exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, as did Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino.</p>
          <p>Stablecoin issuer Paxos and crypto exchange Gemini also tweeted that they do not have relationships with the bank.</p>

          <p>Coinbase (COIN) hit the brakes on conversions between USDC stablecoin and US dollars late Friday as fallout from Silicon Valley Bank's (SIVB) collapse spread into the heart of crypto trading.</p>
          <p>In a tweet, the crypto exchange said it was "temporarily pausing" the conversions while banks are closed over the weekend. The exchange said it planned to restart conversions on Monday.</p>
          <p>The pause speaks to the chaos that's roiled the crypto industry's second-largest stablecoin in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's demise on Friday. Speculating on the stability of USDC, traders redeemed $1.6 billion of USDC, lowering its total supply.</p>
          <p>Late in the day, Circle confirmed that $3.3B of the $40B backing its stablecoin was on deposit at the now-shuttered lender. The fate of that cash is now uncertain, with Silicon Valley Bank having been seized by the FDIC, and USDC – for the moment – has lost its dollar peg.</p>
          <p>"Circle is currently protecting USDC from a black swan failure in the U.S. banking system," tweeted Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte late Friday night. "Silicon Valley Bank is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure – without a Federal rescue plan – will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs."</p>
          <p>"During periods of heightened activity, conversions rely on USD transfers from the banks that clear during normal banking hours," Coinbase said in its tweet announcing the conversion pause. "When banks open on Monday, we plan to re-commence conversions."</p>

          <p>Bitcoin,the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 10.98% in the week from March 3 to March 10, to trade at US$19,941 at 9:00 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether slid 10.88% in the same period to US$1,397.</p>
          <p>The crypto market saw a turbulent week after New York State Attorney General Letitia James said Ether should be registered as a security in her lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin filed on Thursday, a day after crypto-friendly financial institution Silvergate Capital said it would cease operations and liquidate its banking unit.</p>
          <p>Investors digested hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said that the U.S. central bank may continue to raise interest rates this year to combat inflation.</p>
          <p>“Bitcoin is still highly dependent on the monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and any words hinting an increase or decrease of the key rate can have an effect on its price,” wrote Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of blockchain software firm Encry, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
          <p>“The depreciation of Bitcoin should not be unexpected since inflation in the U.S. and the rest of the world has not gone away. The growth of Bitcoin in January and February was expected to stop and turn into a correction. Therefore, Bitcoin was expected to move into a downtrend,” wrote Nekrasov.</p>
          <p>The Fed will announce its rate decision at the Federal Open Market Committee’s March 21-22 meeting.</p>
          <p>Alexander Politayko, the founder of MarsDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization developing deflationary products, said that he believes Bitcoin’s main support level is US$18,000.</p>
          <p>“If Bitcoin does not hold on to this level, then the market may witness another wave of panic sales, and Bitcoin could return to the levels of last fall at US$16,000,” wrote Politayko in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, data from investment platform MacroMicro suggests that more Bitcoin owners are deciding against selling their assets despite turbulent market conditions. The percentage of Bitcoin supply that has been dormant for at least a year rose to an all-time high of 67.84% last weekend.</p>
          <p>“There is a growing number of investors who view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but also as a store of value or tool for savings. This is significant because it indicates a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a purely speculative asset to one that has a practical use case,” wrote Politayko.</p>
          <p>“As more people begin to use Bitcoin for its utilitarian value, the demand for the asset as a means to store value is likely to increase. This, in turn, can affect the price of Bitcoin in a positive way,” he added.</p>
          <p>The global crypto market capitalization stood at US$923 billion on Friday at 9:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, falling 10.3% from US$1.03 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$385 billion market cap dominated 41.6% of the market, while Ether’s US$170 billion accounted for 18.5%.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell in afternoon trading in Asia on Wednesday, with XRP the sole gainer among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The new Forkast NFT 500 index slipped, and Asian equity markets were mixed following declines in the U.S. as investors reacted to Tuesday’s comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>
          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin fell 0.76% to US$22,028 in 24 hours as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down over 7% on the week. Ether fell 1% to US$1,554, after losing about 6% in the past seven days.</li>
            <li>XRP was the day’s biggest gainer, extending gains from Tuesday. The token increased 2.42% to US$0.38 but declined 1.25% on the week.</li>
            <li>Altcoin Bone ShibaSwap was the top gainer of all cryptocurrencies, rising over 10% over 24 hours to trade hands at US$1.69.</li>
            <li>The global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 1.82% to US$1.01 trillion, but the total crypto market volume increased 41.44% to US$46.71 billion in the last 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Asian stocks were mostly flat despite losses in the U.S. after hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of the U.S. central bank returning to significant rate hikes to settle inflation. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng saw the biggest loss of 2.35% while Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.48%.</li>
            <li>Investors remained cautious after Powell’s hawkish remarks. European stocks were trading flat, as Germany’s DAX 40 inched down 0.02%, while the STOXX 600 slid 0.17%.</li>
            <li>The Forkast NFT 500 index, which went live on Tuesday, dropped 0.65% to 4,275.91 over the last 24 hours as per 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong. The Forkast NFT 500 Index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market, and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.</li>

          <p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, saw its share price rally almost 9% Tuesday, after a panel of judges appeared to be skeptical about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s arguments during an appeals court hearing, as Grayscale continues its push to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund. </p>
          <p>Judges at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., asked SEC senior counsel Emily Parise details about the connections between bitcoin BTCUSD spot and futures and markets, and questioned the agency’s...</p>
          <p>In June, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC over the agency’s denial of an application to convert GBTC GBTC, +2.64% into an ETF. The SEC has greenlighted several bitcoin futures-backed ETFs, but has yet to approve any ETFs backed by the cryptocurrency itself, citing concerns about market manipulation. </p>
          <p>The lawsuit filed by Grayscale is under the spotlight as it may shed light on whether and when a spot bitcoin ETF might be available in the U.S. Meanwhile, a successful conversion of GBTC into an ETF would help mitigate the discount GBTC has been trading at to its net asset value, or the value of bitcoins it holds. </p>
          <p>Launched in 2013, GBTC traded at a premium to its net asset value for several years, as it was for a long time the only public-listed fund that holds bitcoin as its primary assets. The premium flipped to a discount in February 2021, partly due to the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETF in Canada. However, investors can only sell, but not redeem their shares in the fund, in part as GBTC was structured similar to a close-end fund.</p>
          <p>To close the discount, Grayscale had lobbied the SEC and finally filed a lawsuit against the agency to push for a conversion from GBTC into an ETF. For an ETF, institutional traders can keep creating and redeeming shares, thus closing the gap between the fund’s price and the value of its underlying assets through arbitrages.</p>
          <p>“We look forward to the Court’s final decision, and strongly believe that American investors deserve to have equal access to the Bitcoin ETF product that best suits their needs,” a Grayscale spokeswoman wrote to MarketWatch in an email. </p>
          <p>China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (600900.SS) owns the Three Gorges hydropower electricity generation unit, which has the highest power generation capacity of 22,500 MW. Overall, the company has a power generation capacity of 71,795 MW and has more than 110 other hydroelectric power units under its portfolio. Not only is China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (600900.SS) the biggest supplier of electricity in China, but it is also the biggest publicly listed hydroelectric power generation and transmission company in the world.</p>

          <p>The dominance of Tethers USDT is rising among stablecoins amid an ongoing shakeup of the $136 billion stablecoin market.</p>
          <p>USDTs market share among stablecoins surpassed 54% on Monday, data from CoinGecko shows. This is the largest market share Tethers stablecoin has reached since late November 2021, after the crypto bull market reached its apex.</p>
          <p>Tethers gain came mostly at the expense of rival Binance USD, which has been in rapid decline since its issuer, Paxos, announced on Feb. 13 that it would halt minting new BUSD tokens due to pressure from the New York Department of Financial Services, the states top regulator. Since then, BUSD has shrunk below $9 billion from a $16 billion market capitalization.</p>
          <p>USDTs market capitalization has grown some $5.3 billion this year so far to $71.6 billion, with $3 billion of the gains after mid-February. Circles rival stablecoin, USD coin (USDC), has also gained $3 billion since the Paxos announcement; however, its $44 billion market cap is still lower than at the start of 2023.</p>
          <p>Stablecoins have become the backbone of the crypto economy in recent years, ballooning to a peak market capitalization of$188 billion in May 2022. They peg their price stable to an external asset, such as the U.S. dollar, and serve as a facilitator for trading on exchanges and making transactions between central bank-issued fiat money and the digital asset world.</p>
          <p>Tethers position as issuer of the worlds dominant stablecoin defies its historically opaque reporting about its reserves backing the value of USDT and heavy scrutiny of its internal dealings. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tether used bank accounts accessed by falsified documents in 2018. In September, a New York judge ordered Tether to present financial records on USDTs reserve assets in a lawsuit that alleges Tether conspired to issue USDT to prop up the price of bitcoin (BTC), CoinDesk reported.</p>
          <p>USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency with some $27 billion of trading volume in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, larger than BTC.</p>

          <p>Yahoo Finance’s David Hollerith joins the Live show to discuss the details around Binance’s reported plans to elude U.S. authorities and the expectations for Silvergate Capital.</p>
          <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
          <p>Crypto exchange giant Binance in focus this morning following a report from the Wall Street Journal that, amid the fear of prosecution, Binance had set out on a plan to neutralize US authorities. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on this story. He joins us now. David, what are some of the details here?</p>
          <p>DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, so Jared, just to take a step back, so Binance International is the world's largest crypto exchange. And Binance US is much smaller US regulated crypto exchange. There's been a long running discussion about the relationship between these two firms, and that's become notably a bigger deal as critics have pointed out. And since FTX has collapsed, there are a lot of similarities in terms of structure between the two firms.</p>
          <p>Things reached a new boiling point on Friday, actually, in bankruptcy court. Voyager Digital is trying to sell its assets to Binance US, and notably, the SEC, the FTC, and several state securities regulators have actively been objecting. And sort of the bankruptcy court is trying to go through all this. So Binance US licenses the Binance brand and technologies, but is technically a separate legal entity, though, it's nonetheless majority owned by Binance's founder and CEO CZ.</p>
          <p>As far back as 2020, there's actually been reports about sort of a connection to this, and even documents that have shown that Binance, at least, at one point in time, was thinking about trying to find a way to reach US investors without having to deal with US regulators. So the Wall Street Journal story from the weekend drew from chat logs from Binance employees, and this provided further evidence that Binance for some time has been potentially trying to find ways to use Binance US to reach US investors without having to deal with regulators. Reuters has also reported about this extensively, and they've also drawn-- as was in the Journal story, they've drawn a connection to Merit Peak, which was once a market maker for Binance US and is also owned by CZ, Binance's CEO.</p>
          <p>But notably from this story, I think, what was pointed out was the fact that the SEC Chair Gary Gensler was actually being recruited by Binance before he was chair of the agency when he was an MIT professor, and that's notable. If we are to believe the chat logs from Binance employees, it indicated that he was generous in offering licensing strategies to the companies. Obviously, this licensing agreement situation is the legal connection between the two firms. It's also notable as, on Friday, CZ, the founder, actually did a Twitter Space's AMA, and he sort of brought some of this to the public's attention, too, saying that he had met and previously known Gary Gensler, and that they had a good rapport. And he lectured for his MIT course. So this all just makes the connection between what's going on right now with Binance US and the SEC that much more interesting.</p>
          <p>It does, and speaking of connections, I mean, as we talk about the interconnectedness of this crypto world, as we know, one of the potential casualties that you've been watching is Silvergate. What can we expect to happen next with that sort of crypto focused bank?</p>
          <p>DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, Julie, you know, so for Q4, Silvergate fell into a situation, which is they were less than well capitalized or sort of on the brink of being less than well capitalized. There's a leverage ratio that is watched closely by banking regulators, and Silvergate was about 5.3%. Anything below 5% is a concern for regulators, and since then, Silvergate's come out saying they're going to be late on their annual report. Losses look worse, and obviously, last week, we saw the stock collapse by half between Thursday and Friday.</p>
          <p>So in this scenario, Silvergate is a bank. It's a state chartered bank, so it could go into something, which is receivership, which for banks, it's kind of like bankruptcy, not quite the same thing. And this would be decided by either the California State regulator or the FDIC, and in either situation, it would likely be the FDIC that would sort of take the mantle there.</p>
          <p>So we'll be watching that, but again, that's a worst case scenario. And Silvergate has fallen. It's lost so many deposits in the last couple of days. We are definitely expecting something like this to happen.</p>
          <p>Yeah, most definitely, and we'll count on you to keep watching it. Thanks so much, David. Appreciate it.</p>

          <p>US stocks climbed higher on Friday, snapping a weekly losing streak as investors dialed back fears of aggressive rate hikes.</p>
          <p>All three indices ended the day higher, with the Dow gaining almost 400 points to break a four-week streak of losses.</p>
          <p>Investors digested comments from Federal Reserve officials on the central bank's next policy move. Though Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller said interest rates could tread higher than markets were currently expecting, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic signaled for just a 25 basis-point hike in March, spurring a rally in stocks during the session on Thursday.</p>
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from the key 4% level, falling 11 basis points on Friday to 3.96%.</p>
          <p>However, ISM manufacturing data ticked higher, from 47.4 to 47.7 last month, a sign that manufacturing activity is still expanding despite the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</p>
          <p>"The solid ISM survey and resilience to high interest rates will reinforce the Fed's resolve that interest rates should continue to move higher. Even so, the Fed is unlikely to go back to rate hikes of more than a quarter percent per decision," Comercia Bank chief economist Bill Adams said in a statement. "The Fed wants to tread lightly to minimize the risk that they overshoot and cause an unnecessarily severe downturn."</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency markets are tumbling as the industry's once go-to bank faces a slew of financial woes, potentially threatening global crypto liquidity.</p>
          <p>The price of bitcoin hit a two-week low early Friday and experienced its largest one-hour price drop since the blowup of bankrupt exchange FTX in November. The token is trading 4% lower at $$22,394, per Messari.</p>
          <p>Other major tokens followed suit. Ethereum shed 3%, falling to $1,573.</p>
          <p>The market moves come after several companies like Coinbase, Circle, Galaxy Digital, and Paxos cut ties with Silvergate, which is delaying its annual report due to greater losses, flagging doubts about the future of its business.</p>
          <p>Many large digital asset exchanges work with Silvergate for transactions between entities, and a dent in those relationships could impact industry liquidity.</p>
          <p>Silvergate was entangled in a number of ailing firms such as FTX, resulting in a massive decline in deposits at the bank amid broader crypto market contagion. Shares of Silvergate have dropped 95% in the past year.</p>
          <p>"Fears are growing that a crypto-focused bank failure could constitute a new hit to investors' confidence after the bankruptcies of major crypto players during the last few months," Wael Makarem, senior market strategist at investment broker Exness, told Insider. "As a result, the market could be exposed to new price corrections while investors could be concerned about a potential impact on other market players."</p>
          <p>Makarem added: "This incident could strongly dent the market's recent rebound as cryptocurrencies remain in a delicate position. Additionally, the dwindling number of companies operating in crypto could add to the concerns."</p>
          <p>Crypto's total market capitalization sits above $1 trillion, per Messari, roughly two-thirds below its record high in November of 2021. Investor sentiment in digital assets took a beating in the past year on a series of crypto company bankruptcies, along with a rise in borrowing costs from a hawkish Federal Reserve.</p>
          <p>Sentiment may have deteriorated further in cryptocurrency markets as traders brace themselves for the Fed's next move to tamp down inflation, which remains above the central bank's target.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin plunged nearly 5% over Thursday night following a Wednesday late notice filed by major industry bank Silvergate Capital that expressed doubts about the future of its business.</p>
          <p>In line with Bitcoin, the total market capitalization for crypto assets fell 4.6% from $1.06 trillion to $1.02 trillion between 8:18 p.m. to 9:05 p.m. Thursday New York time.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin hasn’t plunged so fast and sharp since the price fell by 4% from $20,538 to $19,704 on the morning of November 8 as FTT, the token for crypto exchange FTX, faced massive withdrawals.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin BTC-USD is changing hands at $22,381, down 4.3% for the last 24 hours and 6.4% over the past week.</p>
          <p>"After today’s drop, the pullback is close to 10%, and bitcoin is on pace to close below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time in nearly two months," according to a Friday note from BeSpoke.</p>
          <p>Over the past two days, the crypto market is coming to grips with the potential failure of industry-serving bank, Silvergate.</p>
          <p>“Fortunately, Silvergate is not FTX. Silvergate is more of a fiat on/off-ramp for U.S. Dollars, rather than a key source of liquidity and volume for the entire crypto ecosystem,” said Michael Safai, a co-founder and partner of crypto proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital.</p>
          <p>The La Jolla, Calif., headquartered Silvergate said in a Wednesday late notice it would further delay its annual report due to greater losses than it showed in January preliminary results in addition to “certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company” and its "ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements," according to the filing.</p>
          <p>Through Thursday, major crypto exchanges and businesses quickly distanced themselves from Silvergate. The shares of the bank (SI) has fallen 62% from Thursday morning to Friday's open from $13.50 to $5.14.</p>
          <p>Further exacerbating Silvergate’s business challenges, Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, BitStamp, Crypto.com, Cboe Digital, GSR and Circle each issued statements saying they have cut ties with what was once considered a crucial banking partner for the sector.</p>
          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle added, it is “in the process of unwinding certain services with them.”</p>
          <p>Separately, Binance US and Kraken would not comment on their exposure to Silvergate.</p>
          <p>“There is some dismay around the Silvergate news, but it's not clear it would trigger strong selling,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told Yahoo Finance Friday.</p>
          <p>Dexterity's Safal agreed: “It’s more a case of jaded traders digesting the news and not wanting to be left holding any potential ticking time bombs, but not understanding how this differs from the collapses of 2022."</p>
          <p>Safai also suggested the response may have come from Asian markets reacting to the exodus of firms from Silvergate.</p>
          <p>Over Thursday, March 2, $203 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated or $198 million net of short liquidations — the most in a single day in three weeks — according to crypto derivatives aggregator Coinglass.</p>
          <p>As Acheson noted in her Friday newsletter, given little change of the ETH to BTC ratio, bitcoin's sharp drop hit the second largest cryptocurrency ether "in equal measure." Ether is changing hands at $1,570 per coin, down less than 4% for the past day as of Friday morning 8:30 New York time.</p>
          <p>In a worst case scenario of Silvergate's failure, confidence could be shaken, causing some firms to yank capital from the market, Dexterity's Safai said.</p>
          <p>“That in itself could impact liquidity, but that wouldn’t have a ripple effect per se, nor would it last very long,” he added.</p>
          <p>More important for Acheson are the repercussions for banking access if a traditional bank were to “go under” due to its crypto activities.</p>
          <p>“That would give regulators strong ammunition that crypto risks could become 'systemic' and any financial instiution serving the crypto industry could come up against new barriers,” Acheson explained over a messaging app.</p>
          <p>"Uncertainty is currently high," she added.</p>

          <p>The expected launch of the Shanghai hard fork has been delayed from late March to the first two weeks of April, according to Ethereum developers at a meeting on Thursday.</p>
          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The Shanghai hard fork will be the first major upgrade since the “Merge” last September. A hard fork is a permanent split between a new blockchain and its latest version, often adding or fixing features of a network.</li>
            <li>The Shanghai fork will allow validators to withdraw their locked Ether for the first time since the staking feature went live in 2020. Over 17 million Ether (about US$26.7 billion) has since been staked.</li>
            <li>During the meeting, core developers agreed that the hard fork should occur at least two weeks after the “Goerli testnet launch,” which has been scheduled for March 14.</li>
            <li>The “Shanghai Capella” upgrade to Goerli, one of Ethereum’s popular testnets, will be the last chance for Ethereum clients and staking providers to ensure the Shanghai hard fork can go through smoothly when the final “mainnet” version launches.</li>
            <li>“So imagine Goerli happens on the 14th, everything goes well, and on the 16th, we agree to move forward with mainnet – I think the earliest that puts us is like the first week of April,” said Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko.</li>
            <li>Beiko noted in a Thursday Twitter thread that the Ethereum team did not explicitly agree to a mainnet date. Still, they will “probably” set a date during the next developers meeting slated for March 16, “assuming things go well on Goerli.”</li>

          <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>FTX has a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash to repay customers, bankruptcy lawyers say.</li>
            <li>Just $694 million in assets of $2.2 billion recovered are easy to cash in.</li>
            <li>The group said it also lent $9.3 billion to Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research.</li>

          <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>
          <p>In a press release on Thursday, FTX shared the extent of the company's deficit as bankruptcy lawyers scramble to unravel a mess that led to billions of dollars' worth of customer funds getting lost.</p>
          <p>The bankrupt crypto exchange's new executives have so far identified $2.2 billion in assets in the company's wallets, of which only $694 million were in the most liquid currencies, like fiat, stablecoins, bitcoin, or ethereum.</p>
          <p>Lawyers have also identified $385 million of customer receivables, and substantial claims against Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, the company at the center of FTX's controversial collapse. FTX lent $9.3 billion to Alameda, they said.</p>
          <p>"It has taken a huge effort to get this far. The exchanges' assets were highly commingled, and their books and records are incomplete and, in many cases, totally absent," CEO John Ray wrote.</p>
          <p>"For these reasons, it is important to emphasize that this information is still preliminary and subject to change."</p>
          <p>FTX US also has a shortfall, with $191 million in assets versus $335 million of customer claims and $283 million of related party claims payable.</p>
          <p>In January, bankruptcy lawyers said they had recovered $5.5 billion in liquid assets from FTX.</p>
          <p>But lawyers still don't know the extent of losses to customer funds, which burned famous faces like Tom Brady and Kevin O'Leary. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has estimated that $8 billion of client money had been lost by the exchange.</p>
          <p>Its latest presentation suggested there is a $9.5 billion deficit across its most liquid assets, and a $733 million surplus in category B assets — those which are harder to retrieve — including through the FTX native coin FTT.</p>
          <p>It was reported in November that FTX could have one million creditors.</p>

            <li>Crypto companies are cutting ties with Silvergate, once the go-to bank for digital currencies</li>
            <li>This comes after the crypto bank flagged doubts about its survival.</li>
            <li>Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial and other big names have ditched the lender.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some of the biggest names in crypto have backed away from lender Silvergate Capital after the key digital-currency player warned it's having to evaluate its ability to survive.</p>
          <p>Coinbase, Paxos Trust, Circle Internet Financial and Galaxy Digital Holdings all said Thursday they plan to suspend banking with Silvergate, as did the Winklevoss twins' Gemini.</p>
          <p>Crypto.com and Cboe's digital arm are also stepping away, Bloomberg reported.</p>
          <p>The exodus of crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers and trading desks came after Silvergate flagged doubts about its future in business.</p>
          <p>It said it was delaying the filing of its annual report to regulators because it needs more time to look into how badly its finances have been hit by the events battering the crypto world.</p>
          <p>"The company is evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of its financial statements," the California-based firm said in an SEC filing Wednesday.</p>
          <p>Silvergate's stock price plunged to close 58% lower on Thursday, and was down 5.24% at $5.42 in premarket trading Friday. Shares have fallen almost 95% in the past 12 months, as more than a dozen of its crypto firm customers shut down, were fined or came under investigation.</p>
          <p>Silvergate used to be the go-to bank for the biggest names in crypto, operating a key payments network used for real-time transfers between the firms.</p>
          <p>But the lender has struggled in recent months thanks to its ties to embattled crypto players, and it is seen as having suffered during as prices of digital assets tumbled last year.</p>
          <p>It has been caught up in fallout from the implosion of now-bankrupt FTX, which was one of the lender's major clients. Its customers withdrew $8 billion in deposits late last year after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</p>
          <p>In addition, it had relationships with other bankrupt crypto firms, like centralized lenders Celsius and BlockFi, along with digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital. It has also has worked with crypto exchange Binance's US arm, which is reportedly under criminal investigation for money laundering and criminal sanctions violations.</p>
          <p>As fears swirled that Silvergate's troubles would spread through the crypto sector, companies stepped up to underline their positions.</p>
          <p>MicroStrategy said it doesn't have any financial relationship with Silvergate, other than a loan it needs to pay back to Silvergate by 2025.</p>
          <p>"For anyone wondering, the loan wouldn't accelerate b/c of SI insolvency or bankruptcy. Our BTC collateral isn't custodied w/ SI & we have no other financial relationship w/ SI,"  the business intelligence firm tweeted.</p>
          <p>Stablecoin Tether is not exposed to Silvergate either, its chief technology officer said in a tweet Thursday.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts cut their rating on Silvergate stock to "underweight" from "neutral" and withdrew its $14 price target, CoinDesk reported. It also said broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded the bank's rating to "hold" from "buy" and slashed its price target to $9 from $25.</p>

          <p>Interest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.</p>
          <p>On Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst 0xAcid's dashboard on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.</p>
          <p>According to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.</p>
          <p>In June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.</p>
          <p>A crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.</p>
          <p>The record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.</p>
          <p>WBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.</p>
          <p>The Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.</p>
          <p>According to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.</p>
          <p>"Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX," Osmo tweeted early Friday.</p>
          <p>At press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20. The cryptocurrency has seen a 50% appreciation in its market value this year, per CoinDesk data.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell by the end of Asian trading hours on Friday afternoon, together with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, weighed by the financial woes of crypto-focused bank Silvergate. Investors saw a glimpse of relief, following dovish remarks from the U.S. Federal Reserve, signaling a potential stop to interest rate hikes this summer.</p>
          <h3>Fast facts</h3>
          <ul>

          <p>Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, sold 650 bitcoins out of 683 it mined in February.</p>
          <p>The company said it sold the bitcoin to help pay for operating expenses and for general corporate purposes, according to a statement. Marathon sold 1,500 bitcoins in January, which marked the first time it had unloaded any of its holdings.</p>
          <p>Even with the February sales, said company Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, Marathon increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 8,090 bitcoins as of Jan. 31, 2023, to 8,260, valued at $191.2 million as of Feb. 28.</p>
          <p>The move to sell brings Marathon's strategy in line with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year. Prior to January, Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even though the company in May 2022 indicated it could become a seller at some point.</p>
          <p>Turning to operations, Marathon said it had installed computing power of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) at the end of February, up from 11 EH/s a month earlier, and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023. The company ended the month with $219.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, according to the statement.</p>
          <p>Earlier this week, the miner cancelled its earnings report and said that it will need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and currently unaudited quarterly reports from 2022 after an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) flagged technical accounting matters. Riot Platforms on Thursday also said it will delay its 10-K filings with the SEC due to due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
          <p>Marathon's shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday, remaining higher by more than 80% in 2023. Bitcoin is down about 1% over the last 24 hours and higher by 42% year to date.</p>

          <p>CORRECTION (March 3, 12:13 UTC): Corrects story to state that Riot has already filed its 10-K report after asking for an extension.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) delayed the filing of its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
          <p>“After assessing the impact of this revised impairment assessment methodology, the Registrant determined that material errors in certain of its financial statements and reports resulted,” Riot wrote in its SEC filing on Thursday.</p>
          <p>Specifically, Riot said its previously issued financial statements for 2022, 2021 and 2020 “contained material errors and should not be relied upon.”</p>
          <p>For those reasons, Riot said it needed additional time to complete its 10-K and it has since done so and filed its report for 2022.</p>
          <p>Shares of Riot were down 2.4% in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p>
          <p>Earlier this week, fellow miner Marathon Digital (MARA) said it would need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and unaudited quarter reports from 2022 following an inquiry from the SEC that questioned its method of calculating impairment on digital assets.</p>
          <p>Marathon had previously been scheduled to release its 2022 Q4 results after the close of trading on Tuesday, but now has postponed that.</p>

          <p>As firms add more and more blockchains to their strategic road maps, I grow more and more frustrated. Where, I keep wondering, do firms have the money to properly understand and implement such an enormous array of blockchains in their operations? At EY, it costs us about $500,000 to add a new chain to our Blockchain Analyzer platform and we spend between 10%-20% of that amount each year keeping up to date.</p>
          <p>While setting up network nodes may not be too difficult, understanding how networks operate and the mechanics of transfers and payments is another matter. When we add a network, we take a close look at the transaction processing model (how transactions are initiated, recorded, processed and reported); the cryptography that underpins those transactions; and the risks that might be associated with different steps in the process. When it comes to audits, we even identify control points where we can perform verification steps.</p>
          <p><strong>Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.</strong></p>
          <p>Nor are these networks static entities. Ethereum has two to four hard forks a year and other smart contract-enabled chains evolve at a similar rate. The result: Staying up to date on a large number of different blockchains is costly.</p>
          <p>Cost isn’t the only factor, either. Liquidity becomes an issue as well. Polling Automated Market Makers (AMM) for their sample prices by volumes of proposed swaps on different token pairs shows how quickly liquidity drops off once you leave the Ethereum blockchain. Even within public Ethereum, trading is highly concentrated among the top tokens. Tokens without liquidity are much more vulnerable to price manipulation.</p>
          <p>Insufficient liquidity in an inadequately regulated market is one of the main reasons the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). The last year has shown, time and again, that crypto asset prices are often manipulated. So these concerns are unlikely to go away and will increasingly deter firms for interacting with, or transacting upon, less-liquid ecosystems.</p>
          <p>As if it wasn’t complicated enough, just deciding which chains to add is a constantly changing mix. Over the last few years, there has been a constant stream of “Ethereum killer” chains taking up the #2 spot in the ecosystem. A good measure of “who’s on top” is the DeFiLlama scorecard showing Ethereum dominance of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFiLlama tracks nearly 140 different chains. At various times, Binance, Terra, Tron and Celo have been in second place, but none has ever represented more than about 20% of the total DeFi ecosystem value. Usually the second chain by volume is at 10% or less.</p>
          <p>Nor is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility a useful factor in de-risking a chain’s adoption. EVM compatibility means that (in theory) applications written for Ethereum’s virtual machine will run on any other chain making that claim. Theory doesn’t always match reality exactly, however. As a result, EVM compatibility may actually increase risk.</p>
          <p>EVM compatibility is not perfect and the implementation on each chain is slightly different. While this can definitely make it simpler to deploy new smart contracts on a different chain, they may behave differently in a fully “compatible” environment and the claim of compatibility may increase risk that people deploy without careful consideration. We often encounter novel errors when moving smart contracts from bitcoineum testnets to the mainnet. I don’t see cross-chain deployment being easier under any conditions.</p>
          <p>All of this aligns with our own experience, which has shown that the amount of work required to qualify a new asset or service for our audit tools on Ethereum is significantly lower than other chains. That’s because we already have a strong understanding of the underlying ecosystem. Ethereum also offers far more liquidity than any other chain, all of it inside the same ecosystem with no cross-chain bridge risk.</p>
          <p>One way to anticipate how a much more regulated future looks is to examine how the biggest centralized or traditional finance firms are looking at the market for crypto assets. These firms are highly regulated and need to document their processes and work extensively to demonstrate they are not mishandling their client responsibilities. What you will see, over and over again, is that many of the biggest regulated firms have largely limited their offerings to BTC and ether (ETH) and have been very slow to grow that footprint. </p>
          <p>When the most regulated firms do start adding to the mix, my own prediction is they will begin by adding more tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem and, perhaps, adding curated sets of DeFi services from Ethereum as well. I had, in the past, expected that we would have seen this expansion during 2022. But the market turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny in the second half of last year caused many firms to move more slowly and increase their focus on compliance.</p>
          <p>All of these challenges were much easier to ignore when every chain was growing, venture-capital funding was plentiful and regulatory scrutiny was light. All those sunny conditions are gone now and the game is different. Between slashing burn rates and regulatory scrutiny, the multichain era is drawing to a close.</p>

            <li>US equities rallied Thursday as traders mulled over coming interest rate hikes.</li>

          <p>US stocks rallied Thursday as a Federal Reserve official's comments on coming interest rates hikes cheered investors.</p>
          <p>After opening in mixed territory, the major indexes closed in the green, even as the 2-year note yield reached levels not seen in over a decade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped more than 300 points to lead the gains, supported by Salesforce's strong earnings.</p>
          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he's "very firmly" in favor of a quarter-point hike for now, adding that it's important for the central bank to move cautiously.</p>
          <p>That comes after other Fed officials have hinted at the possibility of a half-point increase as recent data have pointed to a resilient economy that needs more slowing to get inflation under control.</p>
          <p>Earlier on Thursday, jobless claims fell for a third straight week, remaining below 200,000, in a sign the labor market is still strong.</p>
          <p><strong>Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. ET close on Thursday:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>S&P 500: 3,981.36, up 0.76%</li>
            <li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: 33,003.57, up 1.05% (341.73 points)</li>
            <li>Nasdaq Composite: 11,462.98, up 0.73%</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Here's what else happened today:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>There's now a convenient way to be on the opposite side of every Jim Cramer trade, with the launch of an ETF that shorts the financial pundit's stock recommendations.</li>
            <li>Economist Nouriel Roubini said a debt crisis, recession, and stagflation trifecta will hit the US economy this year.</li>
            <li>The odds of a catastrophic US debt default have more than tripled since the start of 2023, according to MSCI.</li>
            <li>China's imports of seaborne Russian oil are on track hit a record high this month.</li>

          <p>Layer 1 blockchain network Near Protocol has launched a product-first operating system that developers can build into and users can interact on as a single platform, Illia Polosukhin, Near’s co-founder, announced at the ETHDenver industry conference.</p>
          <p>The platform is intended to act as a common layer for browsing and discovering Web 3 products including crypto exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) galleries and social networks, according to Polosukhin. The framework will be compatible with all blockchains (currently supporting Near Protocol and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains) and Near will act as the common entry point, said Polusukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>
          <p><strong>Read more: What Is Near Protocol and How Does It Work?</strong></p>
          <p>For developers, decentralized and composable front ends offer a way to build and launch better apps and faster forking of existing pieces and components, while leveraging built-ins such as profiles, payments and notifications as well as searching, without the need to host anything themselves, according to the press release.</p>
          <p>“The composable decentralized front ends as a framework can work with any Web2 or Web3 back end and any wallet,” Polusukhin said. “In the future we will be offering [use of] wallets from one chain to interact with another via seamless bridging,” he added.</p>
          <p>The Near protocol currently ranks as the 35th largest blockchain in terms of market capitalization, according to data from Messari. The layer 1’s market cap was around $1.96 billion and its NEAR token was trading at around $2.28, at the time of writing.</p>
          <p>The platform is dubbed a “blockchain operating system (BOS),” according to the press release. “We are moving away from our layer 1 focus, it’s now about the user and the experience they have. We are looking at this as the frontend for blockchains in general,” said Polosukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>
          <p>Polosukhin added the platform is hoping to tackle some of the user experience issues in the Web3 space. “As a user at the moment it’s hard to find a single place to look at Web3 apps, there’s no search mechanism or way to navigate between them,” said Polosukhin. “The BOS creates a single point of entry. ”</p>

          <p>Business activity is recovering after the ruling Communist Party ended stringent anti-virus restrictions in early December. That followed a slump in activity that dragged last year’s economic growth to 3%, its second-lowest level since at least the 1970s.</p>
          <p>That was good news in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng gained more than 700 points to 20,486.79.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong's own outlook has improved as it also has relaxed pandemic precautions. The territory's chief executive, John Lee, announced Tuesday t hat masks will no longer be required both outdoors and indoors, but some high-risk areas including hospitals and elderly homes can still require their use.</p>
          <p>The Shanghai Composite added 28 points to 3,308.53. South Korean markets were closed for a national holiday.</p>
          <p>Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 picked up 0.3% to 27,523.17. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.1% to 7,263.10.</p>
          <p>Wall Street closed out a frigid February with more losses on Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, locking in a loss of 2.6% for the month and closing at 3,970.15. The Dow fell 0.7% to 32,656.70 while the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower to 11,455.54. Both also sank over the month.</p>
          <p>Investors are keeping an eye on the last of the earnings reports for this season. Several big-name retailers are still on the schedule for this week.</p>
          <p>“The consumer and inflation are in focus over the next few days. After last week’s drubbing among retail stocks, the worst since June last year, some upbeat earnings results from Target should buoy the group,” said Brian Overby, senior market strategist at Ally, while warning that more volatility may be in store later this week.</p>
          <p>After a strong start to the year driven by hopes inflation is abating, Wall Street shifted into reverse in February. A stream of data showed inflation and the overall economy are remaining more resilient than expected. That’s forced investors to raise their forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there.</p>
          <p>High rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession down the line because they hurt the economy. They also drag on prices for stocks and other investments. </p>
          <p>Heightened expectations for rates sent yields jumping in the bond market Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.92%. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that shape the economy’s health, and still near its highest level since November. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, ticked up to 4.81% from 4.78%. It’s near its highest level since 2007.</p>
          <p>Reports on the economy released Tuesday showed some slight cracks. One said that confidence among U.S. consumers fell in February. Another said that manufacturing in the Chicago region weakened by more than expected.</p>
          <p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 48 cents to $77.53 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, rose $0.52 to $83.97 a barrel.</p>
          <p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to $136.37 Japanese yen from $136.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.0596 from $1.0583.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA closed 0.7% lower Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX fell 0.3% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP edged down 0.1%, according to preliminary data from FactSet.

          <p>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks edged lower on Tuesday, on track for their biggest February percentage decline in over two decades, as geopolitical risks and fears about U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer cooled demand for riskier assets.</p>
          <p>The MSCI EM equities index slipped 0.5% and was down 6.6% this month, headed for its worst February performance since 2001. A rally in EM stocks at the beginning of 2023 has petered out in recent weeks after signs of strength in the U.S economy fueled fears of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical risks including heightened U.S.-China tensions also weighed on sentiment.</p>
          <p>"It's started to get more challenging for emerging markets," said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</p>
          <p>"We think weakness in the global economy will lead to more risk-off in the next few quarters, providing a difficult backdrop."</p>
          <p>Data on Tuesday showed China's urban employment fell for the first time in six decades last year and per capita spending also marked a rare decline, as harsh COVID-19 curbs ravaged the world's second-biggest economy.</p>
          <p>Stocks in China rose 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 0.8%.</p>
          <p>Regional currencies were muted against a stronger dollar and are set to record their worst month since September 2022.</p>
          <p>The South African rand was down 0.2% ahead of the release of domestic money supply, budget, trade and unemployment data later in the day.</p>
          <p>Russia's rouble was stronger against the U.S. dollar at 74.39. Local media reported that Russia's oil output was back at pre-sactions levels for the first time in February.</p>
          <p>Turkey's lira was flat at 18.8860 after data showed the country's economy expanded 5.6% in 2022, more than expected with growth slowing to 3.5% in the fourth quarter as a decline in demand continued.</p>
          <p>In central and eastern Europe, Hungary's forint edged lower against the euro ahead of an interest rate decision by the country's central bank due later in the day.</p>
          <p>The National Bank of Hungary is widely expected to keep its base rate steady at 13%.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in emerging markets, India's GDP growth likely slowed further in the October-December quarter amid weakening demand and is set to lose more momentum as a series of interest rate hikes weigh on activity, according to a Reuters poll.</p>

          <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Tuesday as investors reassess the global economy's outlook given expectations for higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>The FTSE 100 FTSE dropped 0.74% to 7,876.28 points at close of trading on Tuesday, while the CAC 40 FCHI in Paris was muted at 7,291 points. In Germany, the DAX GDAXI was also flat at 15,383.</p>
          <p>Across the pond, US stocks fell Tuesday at the open, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street.</p>
          <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.34% to 32,775 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.31% to 3,980 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) edged lower by 0.21% to 11,472.</p>
          <p>Traders are increasingly worried that central banks around the globe will remain hawkish in order to bring down persistent inflation.</p>
          <p>“Rishi Sunak’s new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland breathed some life back into the pound yesterday, yet the currency gave back some of these gains on Tuesday as markets took time to digest the information," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p>
          <p>"While the deal may provide a reset for UK/EU relations and be good for the UK economy, reports suggest some in the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] are not fully satisfied by what’s on the table.”</p>
          <p>Inflation figures in Spain and France both rose in February while the latest grocery price survey from Kantar in the UK showed food price inflation hit a record high, up 17.1%.</p>

          <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado (OCDO.L) dropped by 7.81%, the top faller on the FTSE 100 index.</p>
          <p>The online supermarket saw its pre-tax loss balloon to nearly £501m last year, nearly three times as high as in 2021.</p>
          <p>The FTSE 100 slipped 0.4% to 7,902, pulled down by poorly received results from Ocado and Croda (CRDA.L), and housebuilders falling in response to Travis Perkins’ cautious outlook in its latest figures.</p>
          <p>The builders’ merchant said it was preparing for ‘more challenged’ private domestic new-build and repair, maintenance and improvement markets.</p>
          <p>Moving in the opposite direction, online electricals retailer AO World (AO.L) was up by 23.38% as it boosted it annual earnings outlook for the third time since November as it said cost-cutting efforts and targeted price rises were paying off.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) rose and was trading at around $83/barrel as demand surged ahead of the release of fresh economic data from China, the world’s largest oil importer and second largest consumer.</p>
          <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 N225 rose 0.1% to 27,445 points, while the Hang Seng HSI in Hong Kong slipped 0.78% to 19,044. The Shanghai Composite edged higher, rising 0.66% to 3,279 points.</p>

          <p>Allianz Investment Management Head ETF Market Strategist Johan Grahn sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss volatility and market performances amid inflation and the Fed's interest rate hike cycle.</p>
          <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
          <p>DAVE BRIGGS: All right, welcome back to "Yahoo Finance Live." We're going to check on the markets with just a bit before trading closes. Let's see, the Dow falling now 222 points, and check out the S&P and the NASDAQ hovering around the level point. Down just a bit on the S&P, and the NASDAQ just barely in the positive.</p>
          <p>What is ahead for this economy and equities? Let's talk about all of it with Johan Grahn, Allianz Investment Management head ETF market strategist. Nice to see you, sir. Seems like the markets, relatively speaking, holding their breath. What could be the next catalyst around the corner?</p>
          <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, Dave, it's good to see you. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Catalysts? There could be all kinds of catalysts around the corner for you just lurking in the background here. The one thing that we've seen is that we have an environment of increased volatility. And even if it's been coming down a little bit this past week, we're still in a pretty high-volatility environment by historical standards, so to speak.</p>
          <p>So basically it tells you that all the known factors are baked in and that the known factors are bound to swing one way or another, or something new will pop up at any point in time. So it's a good question with a very weak answer for you because it could be a myriad of things.</p>
          <p>SEANA SMITH: Well, Johan, when you take into account what's happening today, where we are at current levels here, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how exactly to play this market given all of that uncertainty that you were just talking about. So what's your advice to those who are trying to decide what now is-- I guess what is best to do right now?</p>
          <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Yeah, it really depends on what kind of time you have. And I mean, frankly, most of the assets are sitting in retirement accounts, as you know. So it's really those investors and Americans that have the least amount of time left in their investing careers, so to speak.</p>
          <p>And what it leads to is a fight against this wealth destruction that the Fed has set out to navigate for us, if you will. And what it comes down to is that you have to be more conservative. You've got to think about how you can keep that wealth as opposed to rallying for the highest potential return.</p>
          <p>And there are various ways you can do it, and I think one of the benefits of the current environment, even though it's a silver lining given the volatility that we're in, is that when you look at this market with higher equity volatility and also higher fixed-income volatility, higher rates, it gives you an opportunity to invest in structured products where you can actually set the definition of what you're looking for, and it gives you more upside given the unit of risk that you're mitigating on the downside in an environment like this.</p>
          <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Johan, many just feel that the 10 year is really in control and closing their eyes to the equities right now to the highest we've seen since November, 50-plus basis points this month alone. What does it tell you is around the corner?</p>
          <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, the proverbial Fed tactics are always around the corner, as you know. And we're still looking at this environment where you have the Fed consistently telling the market that you are going to have to be more patient and the market reacting and responding consecutively to all this communication. And it's happened over and over and over again. Every time the Fed comes out to have this conversation, the market will try to call the bluff, and then they have to move aside and say, OK, fine. We'll adjust accordingly, and it keeps happening.</p>
          <p>And I think that right now we might be very much closer to the point where the market is, frankly, catching up to what the Fed has been saying all along, and now we're talking about the duration of how long the Fed is going to keep the rates high and how many more hikes they're going to pursue to get there.</p>
          <p>DAVE BRIGGS: And you see no pivot until '24, presumably?</p>
          <p>JOHAN GRAHN: No pivot until '24. The market is still-- there is a little bit of a delta between what the market is pricing in and what the Fed is speaking to the market. But in terms of a real pivot, nothing until 2024 for sure.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin and Ether traded little-changed on Tuesday morning in Asia, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell. Polygon led the losers, along with Solana and Shiba Inu. U.S. equities gained ground on Monday after last week’s slump.</p>
          <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bitcoin dipped 0.23% in the past 24 hours to trade little changed at US$23,509 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The leading token is holding a seven day loss of 5.34%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum also treaded water at US$1,634, off 0.41%. The token is down 4.05% in the past seven days.</li>
            <li>Polygon’s Matic token posed the biggest drop among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, falling 3.63% to US$1.24, and extending its weekly loss to 16.27%. Polygon Labs, the developer of the Polygon blockchain, said last week it would lay off 20% of its workforce, which was followed by a reported glitch on Polygon’s network.</li>
            <li>Solana lost 2.43% to US$22.69, posting a weekly loss of 13.41%. Solana developers are investigating a network failure on the Solana Mainet Beta last Saturday, which forced it to restart the network and downgrade it from a recent update.</li>
            <li>Shiba Inu dropped 2.53% after analytics firm Lookonchain reported a wallet moving 182 billion Shiba Inu tokens to crypto exchanges on Monday, usually the sign of preparation for selling that can drive prices lower. Last time the same wallet transferred over 200 billion Shiba Inu in December 2022 the price fell more than 7% on the day, according to Lookonchain. The token is down 7.21% for the seven day period.</li>
            <li>The total crypto market capitalization edged 0.15% lower to US$1.07 trillion, while the total trading volume jumped 34.55% over the past 24 hours to US$45.70 billion.</li>
            <li>U.S. equities edged higher on Monday after last week’s tumble on concerns about indicators showing inflation remains entrenched. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.22%, the S&P 500 gained 0.31% and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.63%.</li>
            <li>Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, told CNN on Monday that U.S. inflation remains too high, but the economy can achieve a soft landing.

          <p>Intel INTC reported Q4 results after market close yesterday. The world’s largest chipmaker missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers.</p>
          <p>As such, shares of INTC plunged about 10% in after-market hours. Given this, ETFs like First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK, and Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJD having the highest allocation to the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will be in focus.</p>
          <h3>Q4 Earnings in Focus</h3>
          <p>Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and the year-ago earnings of $1.09. Revenues declined 32% year over year to $14 billion and came in above the estimated $14.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Client computing, data-center and AI, and network and edge revenues declined 36%, 33% and 1%, respectively. However, accelerated computing systems and graphics, Intel Foundry Services and Mobileye revenues were up 1%, 30% and 59%, respectively (see: all the Technology ETFs here).</p>
          <p>The chipmaker continued to suffer from dismal PC and data-center markets. Shoppers choose to hold on to the laptops and desktops they purchased at the peak of the pandemic. According to Gartner, Q4 worldwide PC shipments declined 28.5%, the biggest decline since the firm started following shipments in the mid-1990s.</p>
          <p>As such, Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share. Both revenue and earnings per share guidance are well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion and 26 cents per share, respectively.</p>

            <li>The latest Consumer Price Index data showed that inflation was up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
            <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict an 85% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

          <p>BNB could oscillate in a range in the next few hours/days.</p>
          <p>Short-term holders saw a sharp decline in profits after Tuesday’s sudden drop.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin [BTC] dropped from $23k to below $22.5k on Tuesday, pulling the altcoin market into a short-term plunge. Binance Coin [BNB] declined by 9% in the same period, dropping from $323 to $293. </p>
          <p>However, bulls found steady support of around $297 and launched a price recovery. At press time, BNB’s value was $303.6o and could oscillate in the range below for the next few hours/days. </p>
          <h3>BNB remained steady at the $300 – $310 range</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <p>On the three-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded from the 40 level and showed that buying pressure increased after dropping to the 40-mark.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was rejected at the zero mark, forcing it into an uptick on the positive side, which indicated that the BNB market was strengthening.</p>
          <p>Therefore, BNB could oscillate between the demand zone ($293 – $300) and $310 in the next couple of hours. BNB has traded within this range since 21 January, only to witness a false breakout on 24 January. A retest of the $319 could also be likely if BTC reclaims the $23k zone.</p>
          <p>However, BNB could drop below the demand zone if BTC breaks below $22.5k, invalidating the bias described above. But such a drop could settle on the 100-period EMA (exponential moving average) or $286.9 level.</p>
          <p>Swing traders should therefore track RSI rejection at the 50-mark, CMF crossover, and BTC price action to minimize risk exposure.</p>
          <h3>Short-term holders’ profits tanked and sentiment flipped into negative</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <p>According to Santiment, BNB’s 30-day MVRV (market value to realized value) dropped from 36% to 6% at press time. Short-term holders’ profit tanked by 30% as BNB’s price correction wiped out recent gains.</p>
          <p>The price decline was also followed by an elevated negative weighted sentiment and a drop in demand in the derivatives market, as evidenced by the drop in the Funding Rate. However, the Funding Rate rested on the neutral line and any increment could boost BNB’s recovery.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, a further drop in the Funding Rate could set BNB to retest the demand zone below $300. Moreover, the active address in the past 24 hours also dropped, but there was a slight uptick at press time. Any further increase in active addresses could boost the recovery momentum.</p>

          <p>This article is the first in what I hope will be a regular weekend series. A variety of technical analysis techniques will be used to look at probable moves for the S&P 500 (SPY) in the week ahead. No personal bias will be shown and no predictions will be made either. Rather, the market will be viewed in probable outcomes using inflection points - if it is going down, where is it likely to go? If it is going up, where is it likely to test? Likewise, if it breaks a key level to the downside, what does that tell us about the market and where is it likely to go?</p>
          <p>The technical analysis itself will be kept fairly simple. After all, one line drawn from the early 2022 top and through the peaks has been the main technical barrier all last year and continues to be important. Tried and tested techniques such as classic patterns, trendlines, major moving averages and horizontal support form the body of the analysis. Demark systems are also used to detect exhaustion and volume profile shows additional areas of interest.</p>
          <p>The S&P 500 chart will be analyzed on monthly, weekly and daily timeframes, then the information collated into an actionable summary at the end.</p>
          <h3>The Market Narrative</h3>
          <p>While the focus of this article is primarily on technical analysis, a more complete picture combines it with fundamental and sentiment studies.</p>
          <p>Last week saw the sixth consecutive drop in inflation and there is now plenty evidence it should continue to fall. The Fed won this particular battle. However, the labor market, and particularly wage growth, remain a risk to any further shift away from the hawkish stance. For now, the message from the Fed is that rates will stay high for an extended period.</p>
          <p>But is this warning just a bluff to keep markets from getting too bullish too quickly? The market seems to think so - the expectation is that the Fed are going to slow the pace of hikes to a halt over the coming months and then start cutting in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The question next week and beyond is whether this situation merits the bullish breakout brewing on the charts. Sentiment has improved drastically in recent months and is reflected already in today's price. A Fed pivot has been a primary driver for months. What is left to continue the rally? Easing in the labor market and confirmed dovish signals from the Fed would complete the bullish narrative, but neither are going to happen next week. Personally, I wouldn't trust the rally until a weekly close above 4050.</p>
          <h3>S&P 500 Monthly</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <p>The monthly chart shows the SPX trading inside the range set in December. Resistance is at the range high of 4101 and beyond that, 4325 at the high of August. Support is at December's low of 3764 and the 3491 low.</p>
          <p>There are no exhaustion signals in either direction (using Demark methods).</p>
          <h3>S&P 500 Weekly</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <p>Last week's bar closed near the highs. This gives an upside bias into early next week to at least take out last week's 4003 high.</p>
          <p>Resistance comes in at 4048.5 at the 50ma, which will drop to around 4045 next week. There is also trendline resistance (or the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern) near the same level at 4040. If this area is broken, 4101 is the next resistance, then 4203 at the large weekly gap. Support is at the 3764 pivot low and the 200ma at 3680.</p>
          <p>Again, there are no exhaustion signals in either direction.</p>
          <p>The trend is down (lower lows and lower highs).</p>
          <h3>S&P 500 Daily</h3>
          <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics" />
          <p>The daily chart is at a very important juncture. Friday's session closed at 3999 which was above the 200dma at 3981 and above the trendline at the same level.</p>
          <p>Resistance has been cleared and now only comes from higher timeframe references. Initial support is at 3928 and the gap, then last Tuesday's low of 3877.</p>
          <p>There are no exhaustion signals but a sell set up is now on bar 6. This could become active on Tuesday and Wednesday (bars 8 and 9) and suggests a pause/pullback could materialize.</p>
          <p>The trend is neutral/up. Price is above all major MAs and the bearish trendline.</p>
          <h3>Scenarios for Next Week</h3>
          <strong>Bullish</strong>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, there is a bullish bias due to the strong weekly close and the close above the daily 200ma and trendline. A test of weekly resistance at 4040-45 therefore looks likely. If this breaks, it should bring the monthly resistance of 4101 into play, with 4203 a stretched target above that.</p>
          <strong>Bearish</strong>
          <p>Exhaustion signals could trigger on Tuesday/Wednesday should there be a rally early in the week. Failure to break 4040-45 could flip the view bearish/neutral if it leads to a drop back under 3975-80 and the 200dma/trendline which is declining by around 3 points a day. Daily references of 3928 and 3877 could then be tested, with 3764 good weekly support and unlikely to be broken.</p>
          <strong>Conclusion</strong>
          <p>The S&P 500 is testing very important technical resistance and looks to be making a bullish breakout following the positive CPI report last week. One thing to note is that this is a rather obvious and closely watched move and it still needs to clear weekly resistance at 4040-45 and hold its gains to cement a bullish look.</p>

          <p>One of last year’s top-performing equity exchange-traded funds, the VanEck Steel ETF (SLX), stealthily outperformed broader markets. After 2022’s 14% gain, investors may wonder, can it do so again?</p>
          <p>The ETF is the only one covering steel specifically, investing in global steel producers. It manages $101.3 million in assets, only one-fourth of what it managed in 2008. Still, SLX is about the only way to access the performance of steel directly.</p>
          <p>Those outflows may seem surprising. SLX has performed well in in previous years, with three-and five-year annualized returns of 21.2% and 10.2%, respectively. Still, it’s lost nearly $19 million last year despite its positive performance and its indirect exposure to a key global commodity.</p>
          <p>Although nearly half of the portfolio is invested in U.S. equities, the fund also offers exposure to countries like Brazil (19.4%), the U.K. (10.7%) and Italy (5.6%). Top holdings include Rio Tinto plc (12.4%), Vale, S.A. (12.1%) and Nucor Corp. (6.8%).</p>
          <p>SLX’s liquidity isn’t great, with FactSet rating it at the lowest end of its scale, but SLX’s volumes and spreads are within the normal range relative to other similarly sized equity funds. It’s also not likely to close given it has more than $100 million in assets and has been trading for more than 14 years. Its 0.55% expense ratio is at the low end for a specialty equity ETF.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that SLX has a dividend yield for the past 12 months of 4.26% versus 1.65% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).</p>
          <h3>What’s Ahead for Steel</h3>
          <p>Steel price gains may be fairly muted this year after having been driven up by supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war, but nothing too extreme in either direction, according to Christos Rigoutsos, a senior economist with S&P Global.</p>
          <p>“It's not a matter of weakness in pricing—it's the fact that prices will tend [toward] normal rather than actually being weak or lower than that,” he told ETF.com, pointing out that steel prices over the past year have been “sky high” and that the situation is simply normalizing.</p>
          <p>He notes that steel producers will idle production when surpluses of the commodity build up. Add that to the fact that prices are already only slightly above cost, there’s not much downside, according to Rigoutsos. However, he also emphasizes steel is not recession-proof, as manufacturing tends to fall off in that kind of environment.</p>
          <p>Given all that, there may be some upside remaining for SLX, while a similar level of outperformance is unlikely to continue very far into 2023. However, its specific focus and global nature could provide additional diversification to a portfolio with little added risk.</p>
          <p>With recession fears high, a fund focused on companies producing a crucial commodity could be seen as an attractive prospect.</p>

          <p>While actuarial tables and claims adjustments sound boring, market-beating returns are always a good time.</p>
          <p>This year, the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK) has been one of the few stock exchange-traded funds outside of energy that handily topped broader markets like the S&P 500.</p>
          <p>The fund is up about 12% and recently hit its all-time high. It did this in one of the worst equity market environments in years, and without exposure to energy stocks. Energy is the only major sector with positive returns year to date, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 16%.</p>
          <p>Three ETFs trading on U.S. exchanges provide exposure to insurance stocks. With 58 holdings, IAK is the broadest that covers this category in addition to being the top performer year to date. With $558 million in assets under management, it’s also the largest compared with the $525 million SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the $347 million Invesco KBW Property & Casualty Insurance ETF (KBWP). Those two funds are up 4.3% and 11.2%, respectively.</p>
          <p>All but one of IAK’s top 10 holdings—including names like Chubb Corp., Progressive Corp. and MetLife Inc.—have notched positive returns during 2022, the majority of them in the double digits. The top firms in the fund have mostly reported strong earnings and revenues this year, boosting their performance in a tough market, and spurring the ETFs gains.</p>
          <p>IAK is probably doing well for a number of reasons, one being that insurance companies do well in unstable economic times because as more or less steady companies, they aren’t affected by the downturn in the economy like other industries. They also provide essential services whose demand profile doesn’t fluctuate with economic cycles.</p>
          <p>Rising interest rates also boost insurance companies’ “float,” the pool of money, collected as premiums, which they invest conservatively and use to make claims payments. The Federal Reserve boosting rates from around zero to 4% Monday has helped IAK’s companies, and with more hikes expected this year and next, the insurance industry may be positioned well for strong profits for some time.</p>
          <p>So far this year, IAK has seen strong inflows, gaining $422.3 million year to date, while KBWP pulled in $248.5 million, and KIE—a broadly based insurance fund like IAK—gained just $62.8 million. With more room to run, those funds could pull in even more.</p>
          <h3>An Analyst’s View</h3>
          <p>The Deloitte Center for Financial Services’ report on its 2023 outlook the insurance industry in September 2022 noted that while insurers are “facing a host of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges,” they exhibited agility during the pandemic in terms of adopting remote work and adapting to customer needs.</p>
          <p>They should continue to maintain that momentum, Deloitte advises, by investing in technology and their workforce while focusing on innovation and their customers.</p>
          <p>The report also notes that ESG considerations will become increasingly important to stakeholders, and that those could be major differentiators in competing within the insurance peer group. The firm declined to comment further when contacted.</p>
          <p>Deloitte U.S. Insurance Leader Karl Hersch said in a video in its outlook that the sector is at a “post-pandemic inflection point” during which it could “reset the narrative” around it.</p>
          <p>While the report cites inflation as cutting into profitability, it notes several opportunities for growth. Those include small businesses, in particular when it comes to cybersecurity-related mishaps.</p>
          <p>The push toward green energy could result in $125 billion in spending on such matters projected by 2030. In the digital realm, including cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse, the report notes that only 17% of related assets are insured.</p>

          <p>Semiconductor exchange-traded funds surged after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed Monday it bought more than $4 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>ETFs including the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD), the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) gained more than 4% and were among the five biggest ETF movers on Tuesday. A handful of Taiwan and semiconductor funds rounded out the top 10 ETF movers.</p>
          <p>Berkshire’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing disclosed 4.12 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to Apple Inc., purchased in the third calendar quarter. Apple is the top holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.</p>
          <p>The company’s shares have been among the most beaten-down in what has been a declining tech market this year. Even with today’s more than 12% gain, TSMC—as it’s also known—has dropped 32% this year, more than the 27% decline in the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ).</p>
          <p>That decline may have been seen as a buying opportunity for Buffett, who, along with business partner Charlie Munger, are the world’s most famous value investors. Semiconductors are generally priced low at present: XSD’s price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times earnings falls beneath QQQ’s 22 times.</p>
          <p>In addition to the Berkshire purchases, geopolitical tensions in the region may have taken a breather after President Joe Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Indonesia Monday and committed to working together to solve economic and security issues.</p>
          <p>China has promised to reunify Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, which the U.S. opposes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s July trip to Taiwan in support of the country infuriated China and led the country to cut off some diplomatic channels with the U.S.</p>
