        <p>Around 13% of the American population — or 43 million people — have held cryptocurrency at some point in their lives, new research from JPMorgan Chase has revealed.</p>
        <p>According to a Dec. 13 report titled "The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use,” this number has risen dramatically since before 2020, when the figure was only around 3%.</p>
        <p>The latest data from JPMorgan comes from analyzing checking account transfers from a sample of over 5 million customers. It found that 600,000 customers in this sample group transferred cash to crypto accounts at some point during period from 2020 to 2022.</p>
        <p>The study also noted that cryptocurrency holders typically made their first crypto purchases during spikes in crypto prices. During this time, the amount of cash being sent into crypto exchange accounts typically far outweigh the cash being removed. In other words, most people were holding onto their crypto during this time period.</p>
        <p>This changed in early 2022 as crypto prices fell, according to JPMorgan. In recent months, cash transfers into crypto exchanges have only slightly exceeded cash transfers out of them.</p>
        <p>JPMorgan says that this is a result of both price declines in crypto and a broader trend of the savings rate declining in the United States since the pandemic:</p>
        <p>“We view the rise and fall of crypto use since the onset of COVID as consistent with the joint relationship between retail flows and market prices seen in prior research. Additionally, the trend in crypto flows also tracks dynamics of household savings, which spiked to historic highs early in the pandemic but has begun to reverse.”</p>
        <h3>Who's buying?</h3>
        <p>The report also weighed in on whether certain demographic groups are more likely to buy crypto. It found that men of all ages buy significantly more crypto than women, and that younger people buy significantly more than older people. For example, the report found that over 25% of millennial men have bought crypto, whereas only around 12% of millennial women and 5% of male baby boomers have.</p>

        <p>he research also found that crypto holdings were relatively minor for most individuals, with median flows equal to less than one week’s worth of take-home pay. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, about 15% of crypto owners had more than a month’s pay invested in crypto</p>

        <p>The crypto market has gone through a dramatic fall in 2022. Bitcoin has fallen from a 2022 high of $47,459 in March to $17,208 at the time of writing, while Ether has fallen from $3,521 in April to $1,273 at the time of writing.</p>
        <p>This fall in the crypto market has been the result of market shocks such as TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-peg-mechanism-in-doubt-as-ust-crashes-to-67-cents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">losing its peg</a> in May and crypto exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bankruptcy-court-told-ftx-and-alameda-owe-blockfi-1b-but-it-s-complicated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FTX going bankrupt</a> in November.</p>
        <p>Trading fees have fallen on many crypto exchanges, and Coinbase has even stated that its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-ceo-says-trading-revenue-has-fallen-to-roughly-half-what-it-was-last-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">revenue has fallen</a> by nearly 50%.</p>
        <p>But despite this decline in crypto prices and trading activity, this new report indicates that crypto ownership has still increased over the course of the last few years.</p>

        <p>Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released a new report on Wednesday from global 
          financial audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showing that Binance's customer bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BTC</a>) reserves are 
          overcollateralized.</p>
        <p>"At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total 
          platform liabilities," Mazars said <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">in an announcement</a>. 
          The exact percentage was 101%.</p>
        <p>The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX because of liquidity issues has rivals rushing to improve the 
          transparency of their financial reserves. The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin 
          is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.</p>
        <p>However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting 
          at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "They did a comparison of balances per public key address 
          from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or 
          depositories," said McKenna.</p>
        <p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report," she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based 
          accounting firm that provided <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/26/tethers-former-auditor-fined-1m-by-sec-for-sloppy-accounting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017</a> was accused of “serial 
          violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
          Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/18/tether-swaps-accounting-firms-says-it-will-publish-monthly-attestation-on-stablecoin-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports</a> in August.</p>
        <p>Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis. 
          Assets included were customers’ spot, options, margin, futures, funding, loan and earn accounts for BTC and wrapped 
          bitcoin held on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.</p>

        <p>With the recent events in the crypto space, investors seem to be putting more faith in DEXes</p>
        <p>DEXes has seen recently seen an increase in trading volume and TVL in recent time</p>
        <p>Investors have started viewing <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/chainalysis-report-reveals-this-about-centralized-vs-decentralized-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">centralized exchanges</a> (CEXes) with skepticism as fear and uncertainty have engulfed the cryptocurrency market. However, despite the current state of CEXes, their decentralized equivalent seems to be thriving. According to data by Messari, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have recently experienced a significant spike in volume. But how significant have these spikes been?</p>
        <h3>DEXes trade volume surge</h3>
        <p>Messari’s statistics revealed that the top three DEXes, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/uniswap-is-changing-tactics-to-pursue-more-growth-beyond-l1-l2-heres-how/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Uniswap</a>, Balancer, and <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/sushiswap-investors-going-long-can-expect-this-in-the-coming-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Sushiswap</a> had a combined transaction volume of nearly $7 billion over the previous 30 days. However, a closer look at each one showed how much growth had occurred.</p>
        <p>In terms of transaction volume and TVL, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/uniswap-user-and-dev-activity-lack-of-profitability-and-everything-in-between/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Uniswap</a> was ranked first among all DEXes. The trading volume for Uniswap revealed that there had been noticeable rises in recent weeks. This demonstrates the platform’s increased trading activity.</p>
        <p>The trading volume for the DEX reached approximately $300 million, which was a record for the year so far, according to the trade volume chart.</p>
        <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-pink.png" alt="Dex sees inceases in trading volume"/>
        <p>It had experienced $3.57 billion in trade volume over the previous 30 days, a rise of 65.32%. Although the TVL showed a modest dip, it still had $2.6 billion, at the time of writing.</p>
        <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-down.png" alt="Dex sees inceases in trading volume"/>
        <p>In the previous 30 days, its revenue had likewise climbed by over 64%.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a glance at Balancer revealed that the DEX experienced a sharp increase in trade volume. Trading volume reached its all-time high during this time, rising by a staggering 730.38% in the past 30 days to reach $2.09 billion</p>
        <p>The overall revenue climbed by 40.68% and was $1.09 million during the same time frame. Also, TVL had <a href="https://messari.io/protocol/balancer-v2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">grown</a> by almost 600% and was worth $699 million, as of this writing. </p>
        <h3>Overall TVL sees an uptrend</h3>
        <p>It was also evident that there had been a rise in total TVL during November, according to DefiLlama data. From the statistics, it was clear that there had been a reduction in recent months. Starting from $57 billion in October, the TVL observed at the time of this writing was above $92 billion.</p>
        <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-up.png" alt="breakdown of crpto" />
        <p>The obvious increase in these DEXes’ trading volumes is evidence of how recently that area has come to receive a lot more attention. The increased interest could lead to a more balanced crypto economy and encourage participation outside of centralized exchanges.</p>
        <p>This is not meant to minimize or overlook the significance of centralized exchanges within the ecosystem; rather, DEXes provide investors with different options.</p>
