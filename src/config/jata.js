      <p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google</a> is feeling the heat—from employees. With Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing making waves and Google’s answer to it, Bard, suffering a “demoralizing” demo last month, workers want to know the game plan with artificial intelligence and search.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>At an all-hands meeting Thursday, Google workers had the chance to pepper CEO Sundar Pichai and Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk with questions, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/03/google-execs-say-in-all-hands-meeting-bard-ai-isnt-all-for-search-.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">according to CNBC</a>, which said it obtained audio of the meeting.</p>
      <p>One worker asked the following question via Google’s internal forum Dory, according to CNBC:</p>
      <p>“Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”</p>
      <p>Krawczyk, making his all-hands debut, quickly responded, “I just want to be very clear: Bard is not search.”</p>
      <p>Instead, he said, it’s “a collaborative A.I. service.”</p>
      <p>“The magic that we’re finding in using the product is really around being this creative companion to helping you be the spark plug for imagination, explore your curiosity, etc.,” he said. But, he added, “We can’t stop users from trying to use it like search.”</p>
      <p>Of course, search is very much on the minds of Google investors and employees. When OpenAI shared its A.I. chatbot ChatGPT with the public in late November, thoughts immediately turned to how the technology might disrupt Google’s search dominance.</p>
      <p>Fears about that were hardly allayed when Microsoft launched a ChatGPT-powered rival to Google search last month. (It’s available to a limited number of users for now but will be more widely available soon.)</p>
      <p>Google responded last month with a video of a demo of Bard, but that was botched by a factual error from the chatbot concerning the James Webb Space Telescope. Wall Street promptly punished Google parent Alphabet, sending its shares down sharply.</p>
      <p>Another question on Thursday was about the demo, according to CNBC, with an employee asking, “The first public demo was demoralizing, sent our stock into a nosedive, and invited massive media coverage. What really happened?”</p>
      <p>“Questions like this can be fair and we want to reiterate the fact that Bard has not launched,” Krawczyk replied. “We acknowledged to the world that this is something that we’re experimenting with—we’re testing it. But there’s a lot of excitement in the industry right now.”</p>
      <p>Another worker reportedly commented, “Launching AI seems like a knee-jerk reaction without a strategy.”</p>
      <p>“I disagree with the premise of this question” Pichai responded, noting Google has been “working on A.I. for a long time.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, OpenAI was established in 2015 “as a counterweight to Google” in A.I., Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who helped start it, tweeted last month. He also complained that OpenAI had “become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” (Musk is now reportedly working to establish a rival to OpenAI.)</p>
      <p>But Google, though it’s long been strong on the A.I. research front, has much more to lose than anyone else if users start Googling less and turning to A.I. chatbots more for their search queries.</p>
      <p>Google declined to comment when contacted by Fortune</p>

      <p>(Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp said on Friday it made a "risk-based decision" to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network, its crypto payments network, two days after the digital asset-focused bank raised doubts about its viability.</p>
      <p>"Effective immediately Silvergate Bank has made a risk-based decision to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). All other deposit-related services remain operational," Silvergate said in a statement posted on its website.</p>
      <p>The Silvergate Exchange Network, one of the bank's most popular offerings, enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.</p>
      <p>Silvergate shares on Friday slumped more than 2% in after-hours trading, after closing up 0.9% at $5.77 in regular trade. The shares on Thursday had fallen to a record low, ending the day down more than 97% from their all-time high in November 2021.</p>
      <p>Silvergate on Wednesday warned in a filing that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern, disclosing that it had sold additional debt securities this year at a loss and that further losses mean the bank could be “less than well capitalized.”</p>
      <p>After the warning, cryptocurrency heavyweights including Coinbase Global Inc and Galaxy Digital dropped Silvergate as their banking partner. Stablecoin issuers Paxos and Circle, Cboe’s digital asset exchange, and crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Gemini also suspended their partnerships with Silvergate.</p>

      <p>(Reuters) - Twitter Inc reported a drop of about 40% year-over-year in both revenue and adjusted earnings for the month of December, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The report comes after several advertisers slashed their spending on the social-media platform after Elon Musk took charge of the company on Oct. 27, resulting in a 71% drop in advertising spend on Twitter during December, data from advertising research firm—Standard Media Index showed.</p>
      <p>Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
      <p>Musk, who warned in November about the possibility of the Twitter going bankrupt, said in December that the company was on track to be "roughly cash flow break-even" in 2023.</p>
      <p>Twitter made its first interest payment in January on a loan that banks provided to help finance billionaire Musk's purchase of the social media company last year.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. partner Foxconn Technology Group plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in India to ramp up local production, people familiar with the matter said, underscoring an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. partner Foxconn Technology Group plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in India to ramp up local production, people familiar with the matter said, underscoring an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.</p>
      <p>The Taiwanese company, also known for its flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., plans to build the plant to make iPhone parts on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public.</p>
      <p>The factory may also assemble Apple’s handsets, some of the people said, and Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business. Apple declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The investment is one of Foxconn’s biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China’s at risk of losing its status as the world’s largest producer of consumer electronics. Apple and other US brands are leaning on their Chinese-based suppliers to explore alternative locations such as India and Vietnam. It’s a rethink of the global supply chain that’s accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.</p>\
      <p>Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu, who met India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not comment on a possible Karnataka investment in a statement on Saturday outlining his visit.</p>
      <p>“My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships, meet old friends and make new ones, and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles,” Liu said. “Foxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders.”</p>
      <p>The new production site in India is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, the people said. The company’s sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs some 200,000 at the moment, although that number surges during peak production season.</p>
      <p>Output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain. Foxconn’s decision is the latest move that suggests suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected.</p>
      <p>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</p>
      <p>The plan may herald an accelerated relocation from China for Hon Hai. Once completed, we calculate this factory could materially improve the component supply in India and potentially boost the country’s share of iPhone assembly to 10-15 % from a sub-5% currently.</p>
      <p>— Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts</p>
      <p>Several government officials including India’s deputy tech minister tweeted confirmation of details around the upcoming plant on Friday, including that it will be built soon and create 100,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details, the people said. It’s also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities.</p>
      <p>The Karnataka state government also did not respond to a Bloomberg request for comment. Liu has committed to another manufacturing project in the neighboring Telangana state.</p>
      <p>Foxconn’s decision would be a coup for Modi’s government, which sees an opportunity to close India’s tech gap with China as Western investors and corporations sour on Beijing’s crackdowns on the private sector.</p>
      <p>India has offered financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which began making the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu last year. Smaller rivals Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. have also ramped up in India, while suppliers such as Jabil Inc. have begun making components for AirPods locally.</p>

      <p><strong>China E-Commerce Giant JD Set for $1.4 Billion Discount Spree</strong></p>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. will offer discounts across its online shopping platforms from Monday in a 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) campaign to capture new users ahead of an anticipated Chinese economic recovery this year.</p>
      <p>The campaign has spurred concerns that larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. or upstart PDD Holdings Inc. may retaliate with cuts of their own, igniting a margin-eroding price war. JD announced the launch of the subsidy plan in a statement on its official WeChat account Saturday.</p>
      <p>China’s internet firms are revving up efforts to outdo each other since Beijing began to wind back its bruising crackdown on the tech sector, spurring an abrupt surge in competition that’s spooking investors. Meituan is said to be expanding into Hong Kong and has embarked on a campaign to hire 10,000 people on the mainland — an effort to beat back heightened competition from new entrants such as ByteDance Ltd. in the $145 billion Chinese food-delivery arena.</p>
      <p>JD shares tumbled after news of the impending rivalry surfaced in domestic media last week. Alibaba executives have since dismissed speculation it would directly engage its longtime rival, warning that a return to the price wars of years past was in nobody’s best interest.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Beijing launched a crackdown campaign to rein in what it called the “reckless expansion of capital,” affecting sectors from e-commerce to online education and the sharing economy. The government has begun rolling back restrictions since late 2022, intent on reviving a Covid-struck economy.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- With artificial intelligence booming, one key player in the fast-growing space is talking to investors about raising more money after just reaching unicorn status in a funding round late last year.</p>
      <p>The parent company of Stable Diffusion, an AI tool for making digital images, is seeking to raise money at a valuation of about $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because it isn’t public. It isn’t clear how much capital Stability AI Ltd. is seeking to raise in the potential round. A final decision hasn’t been made on whether to go ahead with the financing and the valuation could still change, the people added.</p>
      <p>London-based Stability, whose investors include Coatue Management and Lightspeed Venture Partners, last raised $101 million at a valuation of about $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported in October.</p>
      <p>Representatives for Stability AI didn’t provide a comment.</p>
      <p>That it’s going back to market so soon amid a tech downturn at a much richer valuation underscores how artificial intelligence in recent months has become the hottest topic in Silicon Valley, with the potential to upend entertainment, finance and even education.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Corp., Bloomberg News reported in January, is investing $10 billion in OpenAI, the parent of ChatGPT, a leader in the technology, with tools that can generate uncannily detailed pictures, text and other media with a short prompt. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said Friday that he was stepping down from the board of OpenAI, as his venture capital firm increasingly invests in other AI companies.</p>
      <p>Other tech giants including Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also competing to get out front in AI.</p>
      <p>Stable Diffusion competes with OpenAI’s Dall-E 2, another digital-image tool.</p>
      <p>The way Stable Diffusion works is that people type in a description of an image — say an astronaut riding a horse — and the program spits out a realistic or surrealistic picture. The company says it stands apart from competitors because its open-source software is available to the public. Its practical uses include designing video games to advertisements.</p>

      <p>By Alexandra Alper</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp's plans to sell technology to China's Huawei would be thwarted if the U.S. government proceeds with a proposal to further restrict shipments to the blacklisted company, a draft report by a government contractor shows.</p>
      <p>The Biden administration has been considering limiting the items it authorizes U.S. companies to ship to telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co, which was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 but which continues to receive billions in U.S. goods under a special plan implemented by the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>"The proposed 2023 amendment of (the Commerce Department's) licensing will likely have a high economic impact on Nvidia," according to excerpts of the draft report seen by Reuters, referring to the company's "pending license value."</p>
      <p>Nvidia's plans to sell to Huawei have not been previously reported.</p>
      <p>A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the document, saying: "The China market presents a significant opportunity for the U.S. semiconductor industry. While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”</p>
      <p>A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department "would not have approved of the report in its current form." It also said the government "has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions."</p>
      <p>The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>Reuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.</p>
      <p>The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a "moderate economic impact" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei "relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering."</p>
      <p>Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.</p>
      <p>Huawei was placed on the "entity list" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level" to be shipped to Huawei was "under assessment."</p>
      <p>But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.</p>

      <p>The average rate for <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">mortgage offers</a> clicked on by Bankrate readers Thursday was 5.38 percent, up 15 basis points from the previous week. Mortgage rates remain higher than they were a year ago, so it remains important to shop around if you want to find a good deal for a new loan or a <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/refinance-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">refinance</a>.</p>
      <p>Bankrate’s “clicked-on” rate reflects both purchase mortgages and refinances with all terms, including 30-year and 15-year loans.</p>
      <p>The best deals come with some caveats. For instance, to reel in the best combination of interest rate and costs, you generally need a credit score of 740 or higher and a down payment of 20 percent or more. Many of the lowest rates posted on Bankrate.com also require borrowers to buy <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">discount points</a>, a way of lowering the loan’s interest by paying a fee at closing — known as “buying down” the rate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rates for mortgages</a> change constantly, and they’ve recently risen. Those ups and downs reflect the <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/rate-volatility-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">volatility of the mortgage market</a> as the economy continues to grapple with <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/inflation-housing-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">slowing-but-still-significant</a> inflation and a looming recession.</p>
      <p>While it still might make sense to refinance your mortgage, the rationale has changed: Most refis now are being done by homeowners pulling out equity to pay for home renovations or repairs.</p>
      <p>Key Takeway</p>
      <p>Be sure to get offers from at least three lenders — you can save thousands of dollars by comparison shopping.</p>

      <h3>Average clicked on rate for purchase loans</h3>
      <p>The average rate clicked on by Bankrate readers for 30-year purchase mortgages was 6.31 percent on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Average clicked on rate for refinance loans</h3>
      <p>The typical rate clicked on by Bankrate readers for 30-year refinances stood at 6.23 percent Thursday.</p>
      <p>You can use Bankrate’s mortgage payment calculator to estimate your monthly payments and see the effect of making extra payments. The tool can also help you determine how much interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan.</p>

      <p>MasterCard (MA) closed at $361.50 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.67% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 12.91%.</p>
      <p>Coming into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 5.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 5.68%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.54%.</p>
      <p>Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.70, down 2.17% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.61 billion, up 8.58% from the year-ago period.</p>
      <p>MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.13 per share and revenue of $25.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.9% and +12.55%, respectively.</p>
      <p>It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.</p>
      <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% higher. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MasterCard has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.32 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.8, which means MasterCard is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MA's PEG ratio is currently 1.68. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- US stocks ended the week on a high note, driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates beyond peak levels already priced in.</p>
      <p>A rally in the S&P 500 Friday helped snap a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 scored its best day since early February. Sentiment remained upbeat despite a report showing resilience in the service sector, as some investors wagered the impact of the Fed’s hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers showed costs rising at a slower pace, which was cheered by traders.</p>
      <p>Bond yields rose for the week though Treasuries rallied on Friday, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.96%. A benchmark of the dollar had its worst week since mid-January, ending four consecutive weeks of gains.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls report next week for clues on whether the economy can handle more rate hikes. Data this week showed continued labor-market resilience in the US, supporting the case for the Fed to stick to its tightening policy, a theme that had pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.</p>
      <p>But investors were heartened after Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that the central bank could possibly pause its rate hikes sometime this summer. Traders interpreted his comments as dovish, even though Bostic and his colleagues said decisions would continue to be data dependent and a Fed report on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are in store.</p>

      <p>Traders are still optimistic because even the most hawkish Fed officials haven’t suggested that rates could need to go beyond levels already baked in, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. Swap markets have been pricing a peak Fed policy rate of 5.5% in September.</p>
      <p>“I think they stay at 5.5% and we have to see how data evolves in the second quarter,” she said on Bloomberg Television.</p>
      <p>Misra also added that robust data doesn’t mean the Fed’s persistent tightening isn’t working.</p>
      <p>“It takes a long time,” she said. “Policy only turned restrictive last year.”</p>

      <p>Risk sentiment also received a boost on Friday from forecast-beating factory data from China. Oil gained for the fourth day, with confidence in China’s robust rebound supporting prices.</p>

      <p><strong>Stock Traders Are Ignoring Blaring Bond Alarms</strong></p>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The fixed-income market’s unblemished record of striking fear into the hearts of equity traders is in danger.</p>
      <p>With rates on two- and 10-year Treasuries up a sixth straight week, and payouts on cash at or above the earnings yield of the S&P 500, stock investors are barely registering a shrug. Benchmark US share indexes just posted their biggest runup in a month, climaxing Friday with a jump in the Nasdaq 100 that topped any since early February.</p>
      <p>Why peace is breaking out in risky assets during a week that at one point saw yields in the entire Treasury market rise above 4% is a mystery Wall Street has no easy answer for. Charts may be one reason: the S&P 500 bounced sharply after falling below its 200-day average on Wednesday. Another may be that investors are interpreting elevated rates as a sign strong economic data is likely to persist, says Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance LLC.</p>
      <p>“It’s interesting to see stocks whistling past the graveyard,” Zaccarelli said. “Stock investors may be looking for yields to drop as a sign we are going to have a recession and are seeing an all-clear in the sense that rates are higher.”</p>
      <p>The indifference to calamity on display in stocks was particularly vivid as the week ended. Friday’s 1.6% gain in the S&P 500 pushed the Cboe Volatility Index below 19, testing lows hit when equities surged at the start of the year. A basket of most-shorted stocks rose 3.2% — it’s fifth straight advance — while a gauge of unprofitable technology companies vaulted almost 6%.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-84-1.webp" alt="ncx-blogs"/>
      <p>It’s happening even as money cascades out of stock-focused ETFs and into fixed-income funds, as risk-free yields reach multi-year highs. Short-dated Treasury bills are enticing investors as yields push above 5%, eclipsing the payout on everything from profits generated by S&P 500 companies to those offered by the traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p>
      <p>But while the trade is touted as risk free, it comes with opportunity costs. Grasping for a 5% yield right in an S&P 500 bear market strikes certain money managers as an iffy proposition.</p>
      <p>“That short rate isn’t going to be at those levels forever — it’s probably going to end up lower,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. “What we’ve seen over long periods of time is that the long-term assets outperform cash. And we have every reason to believe that’s going to be the case.”</p>
      <p>Over the past year, the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill exchange-traded fund (ticker BIL) has returned about 2%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 6.3% on a total return basis. However, over the past decade BIL is flat, while SPY soared 165% during an epic bull run.</p>
      <p>“There’s much less ‘opportunity cost’ than what we’re used to because it’s a place where you can get paid while you wait, but there’s not long-term price potential like in equities,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “So for people with more than a five-year time horizon, you still need equities in the portfolio to set you up for compounding returns.”</p>
      <p>The notion that yields may be peaking also has investors preaching caution when it comes to bonds. While bets have been building in recent weeks that the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates past 5% to stamp out inflation — boosting yields across the Treasury curve — traders are pricing in an end to increases by September.</p>
      <p>Tipp hearkened back to the 1970s, when inflation was a threat to both stocks and bonds. As growth moderated and rates leveled off and then came down, equities rose — even though the economy remained weak.</p>
      <p>“There’s a good chance that that kind of cyclicality is going to make its way through the markets, and people that lock in at the short term, exit the long-term markets and go into short term are going to suffer,” he said. “Their long-term returns are not going to be as high because the cash rates will probably move lower.”</p>
      <p>Analysts say that the haven appeal of cash-like positions combined with reliable returns means investors have an attractive place to wait out any turbulence induced by the Fed’s path.</p>
      <p>“I do think that we need to take advantage of the higher yields on the short-end of the yield curve, wait out this continued volatility,” David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview. “And then at some point we’ll hit a bottom, and that will be a great time to re-risk, take that money out of cash, put it back in equities and you’ll benefit from that.”</p>
      <p>Six-month Treasury bills currently yield about 5.1%, the highest since 2007, compared to the S&P 500’s earnings yield of roughly 5.3%. That’s the slimmest advantage for stocks since 2001.</p>
      <p>Though bonds look attractive at current yields relative to equities, the risk investors are taking in allocating to cash is the uncertainty of that yield going forward, said Josh Emanuel, chief investment officer at Wilshire, which oversees roughly $90 billion.</p>
      <p>“So, cash may pay you 4.5-5% today, but in one year that may not be the case, in two years that may not be the case,” he said in an interview. “The challenge in allocating to cash is that while you’re not taking any duration risk and you’re not taking any credit risk, the risk that you’re taking is the opportunity cost or the uncertainty risk associated with what that cash will pay you in the future relative to the yield you can lock in over the longer-term by moving out further on the yield curve.”</p>

      <h3>S&P 500 Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The S&P 500 initially dipped during the trading week to show signs of weakness, only to turn around and show signs of life again. We are back above the 4000 level, so that of course is a good sign, but at the end of the day, this is a market that looks as if it is trying to roll over. Keep in mind that we have just gone through a significant portion of earnings, and it’s been a mixed bag to say the least.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the week, then it is likely that we could go down to the 3800 level, an area that previously had been rather supportive. By bouncing from there, it puts an imprint of support in that region that I think a lot of people will be paying attention to. On the upside, we have the 4100 level, which was previous support, but even more importantly we have the 4200 level above that has caused quite a bit of selling pressure, almost like a brick wall. That’s an area where we continue to see a lot of noise, so it does make a target that a lot of people may look for, but breaking above there might be a completely different question.</p>
      <p>You can see that I had a channel drawn previously, and we did break out of it only to turn around and retest that area for potential support. Either way, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility, so longer term traders may struggle.</p>

      <p>By Mehnaz Yasmin</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - The reward for holding U.S. stocks over Treasury bonds has not been this unattractive since 2004, possibly setting the stage for the sought-after 60/40 portfolio diversification to make a comeback after one of its worst years on record.</p>
      <p>A 60/40 portfolio, which typically has 60% of its holdings in stocks and the remaining 40% in fixed income, counts on moves in the two asset classes to offset one another, with stocks strengthening amid economic optimism and bonds rising during turbulent times.</p>
      <p>The strategy took a backseat in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to rein in inflation. However, signals from the stock and bond markets this year are pointing to a return of the popular asset allocation strategy.</p>
      <p>At the end of February, the S&P 500 returned 5.41% in earnings yield, the reciprocal of price-to-earnings ratio, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond surged to 3.94%, according to data from Refinitiv. The 1.47 percentage-point difference is the lowest upside stocks have held over bonds in nearly two decades.</p>
      <p>Earnings yield here refers to the S&P 500 earnings per share estimate for the next 12 moths divided by the index price.</p>
      <p>Graphic:https://www.reuters.com/graphics/STOCK-SPREADS/CHART/byprlqxyepe/chart.png</p>
      <p>"The relative shine of equities is definitely dulled by rising yields across the Treasury curve," said Eric Leve, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management firm Bailard.</p>
      <p>With estimates for earnings in 2023 implying essentially no growth over 2022, rates above 5% on short-term bonds and 10-year yields on the verge of 4% represent credible alternatives to stocks, according to Leve.</p>
      <p>The thinning spread between returns from stocks and bonds is set to bring the 60/40 portfolio strategy back in favor.</p>
      <p>"This strategy does provide excellent hedging in current environment," said Glenn Yin, Head of Research and Analysis at AETOS Capital Group.</p>
      <p>The 60/40 portfolio has already had the best start to the year since 1991, according to Bank of America.</p>
      <p>The Fed's move to tighten monetary policy at the fastest pace in decades pumped up bond yields after nearly two years of near-zero interest rates.</p>
      <p>But a rise in yields poses headwinds for equities, especially growth stocks, and by extension, a large index like the S&P 500. Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among the tech heavyweights that make up nearly a fifth of the index and bore the brunt of a sell-off last year.</p>
      <p>"Equity yields will continue to struggle this year as both prices and earnings decline" amid an economic slowdown, said Lance Roberts, Chief Investment Strategist at RIA Advisors.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, "during a recession, yields will fall and Treasury bond prices will rise," said Roberts. He prefers bonds over stocks today, he added.</p>
      <p>Recent results and guidance from companies have bolstered the case for investors who believe the stock market's early-year rally is unlikely to last.</p>
      <p>As of Feb. 24, results from 465 of the S&P 500 companies showed fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have fallen 3.2% from the year-ago quarter while Wall Street's expectation for S&P earnings growth for 2023 fell to 1.7% from an expected 4.4% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Expectations for U.S. earnings to decline in the first two quarters if the year come amid weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results for 2022, which Credit Suisse estimates will be the worst earnings season outside of a recession in 24 years.</p>
      <p>Investors are hoping that in case of a severe recession, the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates. While the economic downturn would hit stock returns, drop in bond yields should provide some relief in such a scenario, according to analysts.</p>
      <p>"For me, the best risk-reward portfolio in this environment for now is long duration Treasury bonds, and deep value, dividend equities," Roberts said. Deep value refers to stocks that are trading at a huge discount to their intrinsic values.</p>
      <p>"When the recession arrives, and the Fed cuts rates to zero, I will sell my bond portfolio to lock in the capital appreciation, and buy distressed equities with high yields and companies with strong balance sheets and earnings growth," he added.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are moving in Friday's intraday trading.</p>
      <p><strong>Video Transcript</strong></p>
      <p>[AUDIO LOGO]</p>
      <p>- Yeah. And taking a look at the market reaction here this morning too. You do see a little bit of just before the start of that 10:00 AM hour, it's moved lower off of, though, some of the intraday highs that we had seen early in today's trading activity on the Dow Jones Industrial average. Still holding onto gains of about a quarter of a percent in the green.</p>
      <p>The NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that also in positive territory. Up triple digits on a point basis. Percentage basis, it's up by about 1%. We'll round that off too. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 7/10 of a percent right now. Still holding on to those gains.</p>
      <p>And additionally, checking in on the major sectors here. The S&P 500 11. Taking a look at those sectors, and XLB is leading the pack, at least on that previous time scale that was loaded up on the screen. XLRE here on the day, on this Fri-yay, it's higher by about 1.25%. But you've got XLP. Yeah, indeed. Consumer staples not looking so hot, hot, hot. Down by about 7/10 of a percent here this morning, and we'll continue to watch that as we move on throughout the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>Overall though, you've got more gainers than laggards here, and we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. Taking a look at some of the Dow components as well. Apple is really leading the charge today. You're seeing that higher by about 2.5%. We've got much more on that this hour as well. And taking a look at the NASDAQ, you've also got a pretty mixed picture here. We'll kind of put this on a broader heat map view. It looks like more gainers than laggards. Just a rough look at things here on the day.</p>

      <p>Layer 1 blockchain network Near Protocol has launched a product-first operating system that developers can build into and users can interact on as a single platform, Illia Polosukhin, Near’s co-founder, announced at the ETHDenver industry conference.</p>
      <p>The platform is intended to act as a common layer for browsing and discovering Web 3 products including crypto exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) galleries and social networks, according to Polosukhin. The framework will be compatible with all blockchains (currently supporting Near Protocol and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains) and Near will act as the common entry point, said Polusukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>

      <p>For developers, decentralized and composable front ends offer a way to build and launch better apps and faster forking of existing pieces and components, while leveraging built-ins such as profiles, payments and notifications as well as searching, without the need to host anything themselves, according to the press release.</p>
      <p>“The composable decentralized front ends as a framework can work with any Web2 or Web3 back end and any wallet,” Polusukhin said. “In the future we will be offering [use of] wallets from one chain to interact with another via seamless bridging,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Near protocol currently ranks as the 35th largest blockchain in terms of market capitalization, according to <a href="https://messari.io/asset/near-protocol?utm_term=messari%20near&utm_campaign=G_Messari_SEM_BR_EXM_PRO_Assets_NEAR+Protocol&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=1352272735&hsa_cam=18594931872&hsa_grp=141104089806&hsa_ad=628425722546&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-1832692015359&hsa_kw=messari%20near&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAiAjPyfBhBMEiwAB2CCIiqo9vrQjGuN4qjLXl6P_bUijVenAOahSaIOOsIIoQM-Chxn4YSuLBoCi4kQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">data</a> from Messari. The layer 1’s market cap was around $1.96 billion and its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/near-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NEAR</a> token was trading at around $2.28, at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>The platform is dubbed a “blockchain operating system (BOS),” according to the press release. “We are moving away from our layer 1 focus, it’s now about the user and the experience they have. We are looking at this as the frontend for blockchains in general,” said Polosukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>
      <p>Polosukhin added the platform is hoping to tackle some of the user experience issues in the Web3 space. “As a user at the moment it’s hard to find a single place to look at Web3 apps, there’s no search mechanism or way to navigate between them,” said Polosukhin. “The BOS creates a single point of entry. ”</p>

        <li>US equities rallied Thursday as traders mulled over coming interest rate hikes.</li>
        <li>The Dow popped more than 300 points, supported by Salesforce's gains on strong corporate earnings.</li>

      <p>US stocks rallied Thursday as a Federal Reserve official's comments on coming interest rates hikes cheered investors.</p>
      <p>After opening in mixed territory, the major indexes closed in the green, even as the 2-year note yield reached levels not seen in over a decade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped more than 300 points to lead the gains, supported by Salesforce's strong earnings.</p>
      <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he's "very firmly" in favor of a quarter-point hike for now, adding that it's important for the central bank to move cautiously.</p>
      <p>That comes after other Fed officials have hinted at the possibility of a half-point increase as recent data have pointed to a resilient economy that needs more slowing to get inflation under control.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, jobless claims fell for a third straight week, remaining below 200,000, in a sign the labor market is still strong.</p>

      <p>As firms add more and more blockchains to their strategic road maps, I grow more and more frustrated. Where, I keep wondering, do firms have the money to properly understand and implement such an enormous array of blockchains in their operations? At EY, it costs us about $500,000 to add a new chain to our Blockchain Analyzer platform and we spend between 10%-20% of that amount each year keeping up to date.</p>
      <p>While setting up network nodes may not be too difficult, understanding how networks operate and the mechanics of transfers and payments is another matter. When we add a network, we take a close look at the transaction processing model (how transactions are initiated, recorded, processed and reported); the cryptography that underpins those transactions; and the risks that might be associated with different steps in the process. When it comes to audits, we even identify control points where we can perform verification steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.</strong></p>
      <p>Nor are these networks static entities. Ethereum has two to four hard forks a year and other smart contract-enabled chains evolve at a similar rate. The result: Staying up to date on a large number of different blockchains is costly.</p>
      <p>Cost isn’t the only factor, either. Liquidity becomes an issue as well. Polling Automated Market Makers (AMM) for their sample prices by volumes of proposed swaps on different token pairs shows how quickly liquidity drops off once you leave the Ethereum blockchain. Even within public Ethereum, trading is highly concentrated among the top tokens. Tokens without liquidity are much more vulnerable to price manipulation.</p>
      <p>Insufficient liquidity in an inadequately regulated market is one of the main reasons the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). The last year has shown, time and again, that crypto asset prices are often manipulated. So these concerns are unlikely to go away and will increasingly deter firms for interacting with, or transacting upon, less-liquid ecosystems.</p>
      <p>As if it wasn’t complicated enough, just deciding which chains to add is a constantly changing mix. Over the last few years, there has been a constant stream of “Ethereum killer” chains taking up the #2 spot in the ecosystem. A good measure of “who’s on top” is the <a href="https://defillama.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DeFiLlama scorecard</a> showing Ethereum dominance of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFiLlama tracks nearly 140 different chains. At various times, Binance, Terra, Tron and Celo have been in second place, but none has ever represented more than about 20% of the total DeFi ecosystem value. Usually the second chain by volume is at 10% or less.</p>
      <p>Nor is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility a useful factor in de-risking a chain’s adoption. EVM compatibility means that (in theory) applications written for Ethereum’s virtual machine will run on any other chain making that claim. Theory doesn’t always match reality exactly, however. As a result, EVM compatibility may actually increase risk.</p>
      <p>EVM compatibility is not perfect and the implementation on each chain is slightly different. While this can definitely make it simpler to deploy new smart contracts on a different chain, they may behave differently in a fully “compatible” environment and the claim of compatibility may increase risk that people deploy without careful consideration. We often encounter novel errors when moving smart contracts from bitcoineum testnets to the mainnet. I don’t see cross-chain deployment being easier under any conditions.</p>
      <p>All of this aligns with our own experience, which has shown that the amount of work required to qualify a new asset or service for our audit tools on Ethereum is significantly lower than other chains. That’s because we already have a strong understanding of the underlying ecosystem. Ethereum also offers far more liquidity than any other chain, all of it inside the same ecosystem with no cross-chain bridge risk.</p>
      <p>One way to anticipate how a much more regulated future looks is to examine how the biggest centralized or traditional finance firms are looking at the market for crypto assets. These firms are highly regulated and need to document their processes and work extensively to demonstrate they are not mishandling their client responsibilities. What you will see, over and over again, is that many of the biggest regulated firms have largely limited their offerings to BTC and ether (ETH) and have been very slow to grow that footprint. </p>
      <p>When the most regulated firms do start adding to the mix, my own prediction is they will begin by adding more tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem and, perhaps, adding curated sets of DeFi services from Ethereum as well. I had, in the past, expected that we would have seen this expansion during 2022. But the market turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny in the second half of last year caused many firms to move more slowly and increase their focus on compliance.</p>
      <p>All of these challenges were much easier to ignore when every chain was growing, venture-capital funding was plentiful and regulatory scrutiny was light. All those sunny conditions are gone now and the game is different. Between slashing burn rates and regulatory scrutiny, the multichain era is drawing to a close.</p>

      <p>CORRECTION (March 3, 12:13 UTC): Corrects story to state that Riot has already filed its 10-K report after asking for an extension.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) delayed the filing of its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
      <p>“After assessing the impact of this revised impairment assessment methodology, the Registrant determined that material errors in certain of its financial statements and reports resulted,” Riot wrote in its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000155837023002681/tmb-20221231xnt10k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SEC filing</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Specifically, Riot said its previously issued financial statements for 2022, 2021 and 2020 “contained material errors and should not be relied upon.”</p>
      <p>For those reasons, Riot said it needed additional time to complete its 10-K and it has since done so and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001167419/000155837023002704/riot-20221231x10k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">filed its report for 2022</a>.</p>
      <p>Shares of Riot were down 2.4% in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, fellow miner Marathon Digital (MARA) said it would <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/28/bitcoin-miner-marathon-digital-to-restate-some-results-on-accounting-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and unaudited quarter reports from 2022</a> following an inquiry from the SEC that questioned its method of calculating impairment on digital assets.</p>
      <p>Marathon had previously been scheduled to release its 2022 Q4 results after the close of trading on Tuesday, but now has postponed that.</p>

      <p>Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, sold 650 bitcoins out of 683 it mined in February.</p>
      <p>The company said it sold the bitcoin to help pay for operating expenses and for general corporate purposes, <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1303/marathon-digital-holdings-announces-bitcoin-production-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">according to a statement</a>. Marathon sold <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/03/marathon-digital-sells-mined-bitcoin-for-first-time-to-monetize-recent-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">1,500 bitcoins in January</a>, which marked the first time it had unloaded any of its holdings.</p>
      <p>Even with the February sales, said company Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, Marathon increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 8,090 bitcoins as of Jan. 31, 2023, to 8,260, valued at $191.2 million as of Feb. 28.</p>
      <p>The move to sell brings Marathon's strategy in line with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/05/riot-blockchain-bitcoin-mined-rises-to-511-in-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year</a>. Prior to January, Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even though the company <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/marathon-digital-may-start-to-sell-some-of-its-bitcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">in May 2022 indicated</a> it could become a seller at some point.</p>
      <p>Turning to operations, Marathon said it had installed computing power of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) at the end of February, up from 11 EH/s a month earlier, and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023. The company ended the month with $219.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, according to the statement.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the miner cancelled its earnings report and said that it will need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and currently unaudited quarterly reports from 2022 after an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) flagged technical accounting matters. Riot Platforms on Thursday also said it will <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/bitcoin-miner-riot-delays-10k-filing-due-to-impairment-calculation-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">delay its 10-K filings</a> with the SEC due to due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
      <p>Marathon's shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday, remaining higher by more than 80% in 2023. Bitcoin is down about 1% over the last 24 hours and higher by 42% year to date.</p>

      <p>Interest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/gfk_acid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">0xAcid</a>'s <a href="https://dune.com/gfkacid/btcb-avalanche-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dashboard</a> on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.</p>
      <p>According to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.</p>
      <p>In June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.</p>
      <p>A crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.</p>
      <p>The record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.</p>
      <p>WBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.</p>
      <p>The Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.</p>
      <p>According to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.</p>
      <p>"Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX," <a href="https://twitter.com/Flowslikeosmo/status/1631444307550031873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Osmo tweeted</a> early Friday.</p>
      <p>At press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20. The cryptocurrency has seen a 50% appreciation in its market value this year, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/avax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">per CoinDesk data</a>.</p>

        <li>Crypto companies are cutting ties with Silvergate, once the go-to bank for digital currencies</li>
        <li>This comes after the crypto bank flagged doubts about its survival.</li>
        <li>Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial and other big names have ditched the lender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the biggest names in crypto have backed away from lender Silvergate Capital after the key digital-currency player warned it's having to evaluate its ability to survive.</p>
      <p>Coinbase, Paxos Trust, Circle Internet Financial and Galaxy Digital Holdings all said Thursday they plan to suspend banking with Silvergate, as did the Winklevoss twins' Gemini.</p>
      <p>Crypto.com and Cboe's digital arm are also stepping away, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/coinbase-galaxy-paxos-stop-accepting-transfers-via-silvergate-1.1890372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The exodus of crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers and trading desks came after Silvergate flagged doubts about its future in business.</p>
      <p>It said it was delaying the filing of its annual report to regulators because it needs more time to look into how badly its finances have been hit by the events battering the crypto world.</p>
      <p>"The company is evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of its financial statements," the California-based firm said in an SEC filing Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Silvergate's stock price plunged to close 58% lower on Thursday, and was down 5.24% at $5.42 in premarket trading Friday. Shares have fallen almost 95% in the past 12 months, as more than a dozen of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-silvergate-alameda-research-sketchy-ties-cryptocurrency-report-2023-1?utm_medium=ingest&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=markets&utm_source=yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">its crypto firm customers shut down, were fined or came under investigation</a>.</p>
      <p>Silvergate used to be the go-to bank for the biggest names in crypto, operating a key payments network used for real-time transfers between the firms.</p>
      <p>But the lender has struggled in recent months thanks to its ties to embattled crypto players, and it is seen as having suffered during as prices of digital assets tumbled last year.</p>
      <p>It has been caught up in fallout from the implosion of now-bankrupt FTX, which was one of the lender's major clients. Its customers withdrew $8 billion in deposits late last year after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</p>
      <p>In addition, it had relationships with other bankrupt crypto firms, like centralized lenders Celsius and BlockFi, along with digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital. It has also has worked with crypto exchange Binance's US arm, which is reportedly under criminal investigation for money laundering and criminal sanctions violations.</p>
      <p>As fears swirled that Silvergate's troubles would spread through the crypto sector, companies stepped up to underline their positions.</p>
      <p>MicroStrategy said it doesn't have any financial relationship with Silvergate, other than a loan it needs to pay back to Silvergate by 2025.</p>
      <p>"For anyone wondering, the loan wouldn't accelerate b/c of SI insolvency or bankruptcy. Our BTC collateral isn't custodied w/ SI & we have no other financial relationship w/ SI,"  the business intelligence firm <a href="https://twitter.com/MicroStrategy/status/1631366897378680835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1631366897378680835%7Ctwgr%5Ee70269101b3a10a42fdce88a8572eff40c6ba5a6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fmicrostrategy-tether-adds-to-firms-distancing-from-silvergate-as-stock-dives-57" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin Tether is not exposed to Silvergate either, its chief technology officer said in a tweet Thursday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts cut their rating on Silvergate stock to "underweight" from "neutral" and withdrew its $14 price target, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/02/silvergate-downgraded-by-jpm-canaccord-amid-doubts-of-banks-solvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CoinDesk reported</a>. It also said broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded the bank's rating to "hold" from "buy" and slashed its price target to $9 from $25.</p>

      <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>

        <li>FTX has a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash to repay customers, bankruptcy lawyers say.</li>
        <li>Just $694 million in assets of $2.2 billion recovered are easy to cash in.</li>
        <li>The group said it also lent $9.3 billion to Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research.</li>

      <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>
      <p>In a press release on Thursday, FTX shared the extent of the company's deficit as bankruptcy lawyers scramble to unravel a mess that led to billions of dollars' worth of customer funds getting lost.</p>
      <p>The bankrupt crypto exchange's new executives have so far identified $2.2 billion in assets in the company's wallets, of which only $694 million were in the most liquid currencies, like fiat, stablecoins, bitcoin, or ethereum.</p>
      <p>Lawyers have also identified $385 million of customer receivables, and substantial claims against Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, the company at the center of FTX's controversial collapse. FTX lent $9.3 billion to Alameda, they said.</p>
      <p>"It has taken a huge effort to get this far. The exchanges' assets were highly commingled, and their books and records are incomplete and, in many cases, totally absent," CEO John Ray wrote.</p>
      <p>"For these reasons, it is important to emphasize that this information is still preliminary and subject to change."</p>
      <p>FTX US also has a shortfall, with $191 million in assets versus $335 million of customer claims and $283 million of related party claims payable.</p>
      <p>In January, bankruptcy lawyers said they had recovered $5.5 billion in liquid assets from FTX.</p>
      <p>But lawyers still don't know the extent of losses to customer funds, which burned famous faces like Tom Brady and Kevin O'Leary. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/alameda-billion-in-liabilities-in-korean-friends-account-2022-12?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">estimated</a> that $8 billion of client money had been lost by the exchange.</p>
      <p>Its latest presentation suggested there is a $9.5 billion deficit across its most liquid assets, and a $733 million surplus in category B assets — those which are harder to retrieve — including through the FTX native coin FTT.</p>
      <p>It was reported in November that <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-repay-clients-ftx-bankruptcy-1-million-creditors-2022-11?utm_medium=ingest&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=markets&utm_source=yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FTX could have one million creditors</a>.</p>

      <p>The expected launch of the Shanghai hard fork has been delayed from late March to the first two weeks of April, according to Ethereum developers at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhrb5txJ4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">meeting</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Shanghai hard fork will be the first major upgrade since the “<a href="https://forkast.news/ethereum-merge-ugrade-successfully-ether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Merge</a>” last September. A hard fork is a permanent split between a new blockchain and its latest version, often adding or fixing features of a network.</li>
        <li>The Shanghai fork will allow validators to withdraw their locked Ether for the first time since the staking feature went live in 2020. Over 17 million Ether (about US$26.7 billion) has since been staked.</li>
        <li>During the meeting, core developers agreed that the hard fork should occur at least two weeks after the “Goerli testnet launch,” which has been scheduled for March 14.</li>
        <li>The “Shanghai Capella” upgrade to Goerli, one of Ethereum’s popular testnets, will be the last chance for Ethereum clients and staking providers to ensure the Shanghai hard fork can go through smoothly when the final “mainnet” version launches.</li>
        <li>“So imagine Goerli happens on the 14th, everything goes well, and on the 16th, we agree to move forward with mainnet – I think the earliest that puts us is like the first week of April,” said Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko.</li>
        <li>Beiko noted in a Thursday Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1631373281650708481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1631373281650708481%7Ctwgr%5Ede9900804edfc27c2742ecef27ff6748b58b9d3c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fethereum-core-developers-push-shanghai-upgrade-to-early-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">thread</a> that the Ethereum team did not explicitly agree to a mainnet date. Still, they will “probably” set a date during the next developers meeting slated for March 16, “assuming things go well on Goerli.”</li>

      <p>US stocks climbed higher on Friday, snapping a weekly losing streak as investors dialed back fears of aggressive rate hikes.</p>
      <p>All three indices ended the day higher, with the Dow gaining almost 400 points to break a four-week streak of losses.</p>
      <p>Investors digested comments from Federal Reserve officials on the central bank's next policy move. Though Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller said interest rates could tread higher than markets were currently expecting, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic signaled for just a 25 basis-point hike in March, spurring a rally in stocks during the session on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from the key 4% level, falling 11 basis points on Friday to 3.96%.</p>
      <p>However, ISM manufacturing data ticked higher, from 47.4 to 47.7 last month, a sign that manufacturing activity is still expanding despite the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</p>
      <p>"The solid ISM survey and resilience to high interest rates will reinforce the Fed's resolve that interest rates should continue to move higher. Even so, the Fed is unlikely to go back to rate hikes of more than a quarter percent per decision," Comercia Bank chief economist Bill Adams said in a statement. "The Fed wants to tread lightly to minimize the risk that they overshoot and cause an unnecessarily severe downturn."</p>

      <p>Bitcoin plunged nearly 5% over Thursday night following a Wednesday late notice filed by major industry bank Silvergate Capital that expressed doubts about the future of its business.</p>
      <p>In line with Bitcoin, the total market capitalization for crypto assets fell 4.6% from $1.06 trillion to $1.02 trillion between 8:18 p.m. to 9:05 p.m. Thursday New York time.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin hasn’t plunged so fast and sharp since the price fell by 4% from $20,538 to $19,704 on the morning of November 8 as FTT, the token for crypto exchange FTX, faced massive withdrawals.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/BTC-USD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BTC-USD</a>) is changing hands at $22,381, down 4.3% for the last 24 hours and 6.4% over the past week.</p>
      <p>"After today’s drop, the pullback is close to 10%, and bitcoin is on pace to close below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time in nearly two months," according to a Friday note from BeSpoke.</p>
      <p>Over the past two days, the crypto market is coming to grips with the potential failure of industry-serving bank, Silvergate.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately, Silvergate is not FTX. Silvergate is more of a fiat on/off-ramp for U.S. Dollars, rather than a key source of liquidity and volume for the entire crypto ecosystem,” said Michael Safai, a co-founder and partner of crypto proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital.</p>
      <p>The La Jolla, Calif., headquartered Silvergate <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silvergate-stock-crashes-after-company-delays-annual-report-reveals-new-losses-121923800.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">said in a Wednesday late notice</a> it would further delay its annual report due to greater losses than it showed in January preliminary results in addition to “certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company” and its "ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements," according to the filing.</p>
      <p>Through Thursday, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-industry-distances-itself-from-silvergate-as-bank-collapses-175633982.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">major crypto exchanges and businesses quickly distanced themselves from Silvergate</a>. The shares of the bank (SI) has fallen 62% from Thursday morning to Friday's open from $13.50 to $5.14.</p>
      <p>Further exacerbating Silvergate’s business challenges, Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, BitStamp, Crypto.com, Cboe Digital, GSR and Circle each issued statements saying they have cut ties with what was once considered a crucial banking partner for the sector.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle added, it is “in the process of unwinding certain services with them.”</p>
      <p>Separately, Binance US and Kraken would not comment on their exposure to Silvergate.</p>
      <p>“There is some dismay around the Silvergate news, but it's not clear it would trigger strong selling,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told Yahoo Finance Friday.</p>
      <p>Dexterity's Safal agreed: “It’s more a case of jaded traders digesting the news and not wanting to be left holding any potential ticking time bombs, but not understanding how this differs from the collapses of 2022."</p>
      <p>Safai also suggested the response may have come from Asian markets reacting to the exodus of firms from Silvergate.</p>
      <p>Over Thursday, March 2, $203 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated or $198 million net of short liquidations — the most in a single day in three weeks — according to crypto derivatives aggregator <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Coinglass</a>.</p>
      <p>As Acheson noted in her Friday newsletter, given little change of the ETH to BTC ratio, bitcoin's sharp drop hit the second largest cryptocurrency ether "in equal measure." Ether is changing hands at $1,570 per coin, down less than 4% for the past day as of Friday morning 8:30 New York time.</p>
      <p>In a worst case scenario of Silvergate's failure, confidence could be shaken, causing some firms to yank capital from the market, Dexterity's Safai said.</p>
      <p>“That in itself could impact liquidity, but that wouldn’t have a ripple effect per se, nor would it last very long,” he added.</p>
      <p>More important for Acheson are the repercussions for banking access if a traditional bank were to “go under” due to its crypto activities.</p>
      <p>“That would give regulators strong ammunition that crypto risks could become 'systemic' and any financial instiution serving the crypto industry could come up against new barriers,” Acheson explained over a messaging app.</p>
      <p>"Uncertainty is currently high," she added.</p>

      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>

      <p>Ethereum’s fee market is slowly returning to form amid a recent resurgence in NFT trading activity across the network.</p>
      <p>According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the median price for gas powering Ethereum transactions cost roughly 10 to 20 <a href="https://decrypt.co/5732/inside-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gwei</a> over the past 9 months. This month, that cost had risen to 38 gwei—higher than during key bear market events including FTX’s collapse in November (36 gwei) and Binance’s “bank run” in December (24 gwei).</p>
      <p>“The incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway,” wrote Glassnode in its weekly <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-09-2023/?&utm_source=gn_twitter&utm_medium=tweet_woc&utm_campaign=woc_09_2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">newsletter</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gas prices fluctuate with network demand, meaning costs rise as more users seek to include their transactions in the next Ethereum block. In this case, rising activity in Ethereum’s NFT market appears to be a primary source of the newfound demand for gas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wp.decrypt.co/93154/nft-trading-slow-down-falling-ethereum-gas-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">You Can Thank NFTs for Falling Ethereum Gas Prices</a></p>
      <p>Specifically, gas used by Ethereum NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two months straight, approaching levels last seen during the “NFT boom” from mid-2021 to mid-2022. Much of that rising activity is thanks to Blur, an NFT marketplace launched in October that’s now <a href="https://decrypt.co/121768/blur-opensea-ethereum-nft-trading-skyrockets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">overtaken OpenSea</a> in terms of trading volume.</p>
      <p>“The recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559,” explained Glassnode.</p>
      <p>Other drivers of NFT activity include all-new projects launched by the industry’s biggest names, including Yuga Labs’ <a href="https://decrypt.co/119063/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-sales-spike-yuga-dookey-dash-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dookey Dash</a> game and the <a href="https://decrypt.co/119958/ethereum-nft-hit-doodles-launch-doodles-2-flow-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">announcement</a> of Doodles 2 last month.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Ethereum network adoption rate remains low. The number of new addresses being generated is still 40% below what it was 12 months ago. This suggests that the recent revival in NFT activity has been spurred among existing NFT users, rather than new ones.</p>

      <p>Alibaba BABA –0.22%  and other Chinese stocks were rallying on Wednesday after data showed that China is quickly leaving behind the lingering impacts of Covid-19 lockdowns, which spurred a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy last year.</p>
      <p>A key measure of Chinese growth marked its fastest expansion in more than a decade in February, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) rising to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January. The February PMI came ahead of expectations and also marked the highest level since April 2021.</p>
      <p>The PMI data is “the strongest sign yet that demand and supply are being fully restored following the lifting of all Covid restrictions in December,” said Raffi Boyadjian, an analyst at broker XM. “The initial tepid pickup in the economy had raised some concerns about how long it would take for the full effects of the reopening to transpire so it’s very encouraging for investors to see that the recovery is well under way.”</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Euro</a> has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>
      <p>The Euro has seen a lot of action at 1.06, but I suspect it is only a minor support level, perhaps opening up the possibility of a challenge of the 1.05 level, which is much more important in the sense that it was a swing low, and of course the 200-Day EMA sitting in that same area has a huge effect as well. Because of this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we see that area challenged, especially as we have seen a couple of impulsive negative moves over the last couple of weeks. With this, I think the real battle begins in that area.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA on a daily close, then I think you could have a situation where the Euro gets hit really hard. At that point, it would not surprise me at all to see the Euro go down to parity again. On the other hand, if we turn around and take out the shooting star from the Tuesday session, it opens up a move to the 1.10 level above, but that area looks extraordinarily difficult to break higher than, due to the fact that we had seen so much massive selling at what is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and the 50% Fibonacci level from the big move lower.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has rallied during the course of the week to test the ¥135 level. The ¥135 level of course is an area that has been important multiple times, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have failed there. Nonetheless, the overall candlestick is rather bullish looking, and therefore I think we probably have a little bit of follow-through coming.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">US dollar</a> has rallied during the course of the week to test the ¥135 level. The ¥135 level of course is an area that has been important multiple times, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have failed there. Nonetheless, the overall candlestick is rather bullish looking, and therefore I think we probably have a little bit of follow-through coming. After all, if the Bank of Japan continues to have to fight interest rates, it’s likely that we will continue to see the US dollar overcome the Japanese yen strength. We also had recently pulled back from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and now it looks like we are ready to go to the upside again. Given enough time, I do think that we probably have a much higher exchange rate.</p>
      <p>If we can break above the ¥135 level, then it is possible that we could go to the ¥137.50 level. After that, the ¥140 level is worth paying close attention to. On the other hand, if we turn around and break down below the ¥130 level, that would probably show quite a bit of negativity, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move down to the ¥127.50 level. You can see that the pullback was rather brutal, but then again, the move higher was brutal to get up there. Now that the Federal Reserve may finally be convincing people that they are serious about keeping interest rates higher for longer, we could very well see this market take off to the upside. Ultimately, this is a market that remains very noisy, but I do think given enough time we probably try to get back to those highs at this rate.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/aud-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Australian dollar</a> has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA, near the 0.69 level. 0.69 level has been important more than once, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see noise there. As we have broken above that moving average, we also saw a bit of downward pressure, so now it looks as if the market is trying to figure out what it wants to do for a longer-term move.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar will be highly levered to commodities, and of course the idea of global growth. With China reopening, there is a bit of hope, but it also is probably worth noting that the global economy itself looks a bit shaky to say the least. The market had recently rallied all the way to the 50% Fibonacci level, only to start selling off quite drastically. Those impulsive candlesticks above should continue to weigh heavy upon the market, especially if we see commodities lose some steam.</p>
      <p>It is probably worth noting that the hammer from the Friday trading session is a candlestick that you should be paying close attention to, because if we were to break down below there, it would be a serious breach of support. Not only would we be breaking down below the hammer, and also the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that will attract a lot of attention by systematic traders. To the upside, I think that the 0.70 level will continue to be a bit of the ceiling, as it is psychologically important, and we have seen a lot of action in that area.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that inflation is still an issue in both Australia and the United States, so the interest rate situation between the 2 currencies may not be as clear as others, but as a general rule of the dollar tends to move in one direction against all currencies. In other words, you can pay attention to multiple currency pairs, and notice the overall direction of the dollar in order to trade this market.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier. That being said, the market also is sitting just above the crucial 200-Day EMA, so the question will be whether or not it can offer support.

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">US dollar</a> has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier.

The 50-Day EMA sits underneath there and is trying to curl back to the upside so I would anticipate quite a bit of noisy behavior. The market has been repudiated at the ¥135 level, but if he can break above there it has a clear shot to the ¥137.50 level.</p>
      <p>If we can break above there, then the market can continue to go much higher. All things being equal, this is a situation where we see a lot of volatility over the next several days as the Bank of Japan continues to fight higher interest rates, meaning that they will be printing more Japanese yen, thereby driving down the value of that currency. On the other side of the equation, you have the Federal Reserve keeping a very tight monetary policy, so thereby offering a bit of support to the US dollar, despite the fact that may not necessarily be their intention. As long as there is a huge amount of inflation in the United States, that will be a continuous issue.</p>
      <p>It may also be worth noting that the market had recently bounced from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, so that is something that a lot of technical traders will pay close attention to. Beyond that, the ¥127.50 level was where that 50% Fibonacci level showed up, and of course it’s also an area that previously had seen support. With all that, it’s very possible this may remain a “buy on the dips” type of market.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/aud-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Australian dollar</a> has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as we continue to see a lot all volatility in this pair. We are hanging around the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that a lot of people pay attention to. Because of this, I think it makes quite a bit of sense that we would see choppy behavior. The 0.69 level being in the same general vicinity probably as to the volatility as well, so it is worth pointing that out also.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, we have to ask whether or not this is an area where the Australian dollar is going to see a little bit of support, or if we are going to continue to see negativity. A lot of this will come down to the interest-rate markets, and whether or not traders are starting to focus on tight monetary policy in the United States, or if they are going to focus more on the China reopening situation. After all, the Australian dollar is highly levered to the Chinese economy and of course the demand for Aussie commodities.</p>
      <p>The global growth situation is tenuous at best, but a lot of traders are starting to pin their hopes on China pulling everybody through. If that’s the case, then Australia will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. However, if this market were to break down below the hammer from the Friday session, I suspect at that point we will see further selling pressure on the Aussie dollar, sending it toward the 0.67 level. Regardless, I would anticipate a lot of choppy behavior, but it is worth noting that we have recently seen a significant selloff from the 0.7150 level that has yet to be truly challenged.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, as we have seen quite a bit of volatility. Again. The 50-Day EMA has been offering resistance, and of course the 200-Day EMA also is an area where we have seen the light of pressure as well. Now that we have pulled back a bit, it’s likely that we continue to see a lot of noise between here and the 1.20 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that a lot of people will be paying attention to. Furthermore, the 1.20 level is an area where we had seen quite a bit of support previously, so I think everything comes together quite nicely for that being a bit of the support barrier.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 1.20 level, then it’s likely that we go down to the 1.1850 level. The 1.1850 level course was a swing low, and I believe that will be the bottom of the uptrend. In other words, if we break down below there, it’s likely that we drop down to the 1.15 level as it should open up a bit of a vacuum. The shooting star from last week suggests that we have a lot of resistance just above near the 1.2250 level, so if we were to break above there it opens up the possibility of a double top, which is at the 1.24 level, with resistance extending all the way to the 1.25 level. Now that we have formed a double top in that area, one would have to believe that it is going to continue to be a very important level.</p>
      <p>If we were to break above all of that resistance, then it would continue the overall uptrend in the British pound, and as things stand right now it looks like we are essentially close to the bottom of the consolidation area. However, I would point out that the price action over the last several weeks has been somewhat soft, and therefore one would have to believe that all it would take is a kick to the market to knock it over and have a go lower.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/aud-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Australian dollar</a> has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>A customer hands Indian currency notes to an attendant at a fuel station in Mumbai</p>
      <p>By Nimesh Vora</p>
      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee rose against the dollar on Thursday, helped by a broad recovery in Asian currencies following losses fuelled by worries over rising U.S. yields.</p>
      <p>The rupee was at 82.77 to the U.S. dollar by 10:29 a.m. IST, up from 82.85 in the previous session. Following the higher opening, the local currency has been in a three-paisa range.</p>
      <p>The rupee, it can be safely assumed, will stick to the 82.80 level through the session, a currency dealer at a private sector bank said. Volumes are likely to be on the lower side and speculative interest will be minimal, he said.</p>
      <p>The Korean won, the Asian currency worst impacted by the market's ongoing reassessment of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike path, lead the recovery against the dollar on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was up 0.8% while others rose 0.2% to 0.3%. The dollar index declined slightly.</p>
      <p>The Fed minutes released overnight noted that almost all participants preferred a 25 basis points (bps) hike at the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 Fed meeting, and a few would have liked a 50 bps hike.</p>
      <p>However, the minutes did not have a significant impact on Asian currencies, as they were considered "outdated". Since the Fed's February meeting, there has been a series of data points on inflation and economic activity that surprised the market.</p>
      <p>We’ve already been hearing from some Fed officials that they may be open to up the size of the rate hikes and that a higher terminal rate may be needed, Scotiabank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Risk appetite in Asia was better, weighing on demand for the dollar. Asian shares were mostly higher and futures indicated a positive opening for U.S. equities. Oil prices inched up, recovering from two-week lows.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/aud-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Australian dollar</a> has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level. By doing so, it suggests that the Aussie is going to continue to see a lot of negativity, and that of course makes a certain amount of sense due to the fact that the global economy seems to be slowing down. Remember, the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to global growth, as the Australian economy is so highly leveraged not only mainland China, but also commodity trading in general.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/aud-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Australian dollar</a> has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level. By doing so, it suggests that the Aussie is going to continue to see a lot of negativity, and that of course makes a certain amount of sense due to the fact that the global economy seems to be slowing down. Remember, the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to global growth, as the Australian economy is so highly leveraged not only mainland China, but also commodity trading in general. As long as there are concerns of a global slowdown, it does make a certain amount of sense that the Aussie will struggle. Furthermore, the 50-Day EMA is starting to roll over, and is getting ready to break down below the 200-Day EMA, a negative technical indicator known as a “death cross.”</p>
      <p>In the area of 0.67, there is a significant amount of support. Because of this, short-term bounce would not be huge price, but that should more likely than not have a lot of people jumping into the market to short the Aussie again, in order to pick up “cheap US dollars.” If we break down below all the noise just below the 0.67 level, then it’s likely that the market would go looking to the 0.6450 level given enough time.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we were to turn around and breakout above the moving averages above, then the market could go looking to the 0.70 level. The 0.70 level is obviously a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we’ve seen a lot of selling recently. Nonetheless, I do think that this pullback is rather significant, and could get the market really selling off if we get more “risk off behavior” around the world. Regardless of what happens next, we are at an inflection point, and therefore it’s likely that we will see a lot of choppy and noisy trading in this general vicinity.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen a bit early during the trading session on Monday to touch the 200-Day EMA. The market bounced from that level to turn around and show signs of life, and now threatens the 1.06 level. It’ll be interesting to see whether or not this happens, due to the fact that there is so much downward pressure on the major currencies that are not the US dollar. The US dollar breaking higher due to the fact that people have struggled with risk appetite, and of course the fact that interest rates on the 2 year yield in America continue to climb, despite the fact that Wall Street believes that the Federal Reserve will eventually come and bail them out.</p>
      <p>The Euro of course has its own issues, not the least of which will be the fact that the economy is running into significant headwinds, but at the same time has a certain amount of inflation. Because of this, the Euro is not ready to go down without a fight but at the end of the day one of the main things that has this market somewhat levitated is the fact that Christine Lagarde has stated repeatedly that an inflation target of 2% is crucial. Nonetheless, if we continue to see a lot of negativity out there when it comes to risk appetite, the Euro will more likely than not start to sell off yet again.</p>
      <p>If we can break down below the 200-Day EMA, then the 1.05 level will be targeted. Anything below there then opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.04 level, and then possibly the 1.0250 level. After that, we have the possibility of going down to the parity level. The parity level of course will attract a lot of headlines, and therefore could be a noisy affair. The alternative scenario would be breaking above the 1.07 level, which would open up a potential move to the 1.08 level. That is where the massive selloff begins from a couple of weeks ago and therefore, I think that as long as we have the same fundamental situation, rallies are more likely than not going to be sold into.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/gbp-usd">British pound</a> has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea. The 1.21 level features the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which of course a lot of people pay close attention to. Because of this, the market is more likely than not going to continue to be very noisy but seems to have a short-term ceiling due to those indicators. Any rally at this point in time more likely than not should be sold into, on the first signs of exhaustion.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/gbp-usd">British pound</a> has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again.

Any rally at this point in time more likely than not should be sold into, on the first signs of exhaustion.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we break down below the hammer from last week, it’s very likely that we could go looking to the 1.18 level, an area that really looks supported a while back, and it’s also an area we had launched from to enter the consolidation area that we had been in for a while. If we break down below that level, then it’s like a trapdoor opening, allowing the British pound to fall quite drastically. It does make a certain amount of sense, due to the fact that the US dollar continues to strengthen across the board, so there’s really no reason to think that the British pound will be any different.</p>
      <p>Granted, the Bank of England has recently had to deal with a lot of inflation and therefore monetary policy may remain tight longer than anticipated, but at the same time you can certainly take that same attitude towards the Federal Reserve, and of course the Federal Reserve will get what it wants given enough time.</p>
      <p>It seems traders are just now starting to come to grips with the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to remain “tighter for longer”, as inflation simply is going nowhere in the United States. There’s a high demand for US dollars currently, as interest rates around the world continue to climb, and world governments have to pay back US dollar denominated debt. I like fading rallies at the first signs of exhaustion.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/usd-jpy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">US dollar</a> has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously. Because of this, it looks as if the market is going to try to go to the ¥137.50 level, an area that previously had been significant resistance. If we can break above there, then it’s possible that the market could go to the ¥140 level.</p>
      <p>If we pull back from here, the ¥135 level courses a large, round, psychologically significant figure, in an area that previously had been resistance. The fact that we broke above there should now have “market memory” attached to it, suggesting that there should be plenty of value hunters in that general vicinity. The Bank of Japan continues to keep interest rates low and fight 10 year yields from rising above 50 basis points.</p>
      <p>In order to do so they will have to continue to print yen in order to buy their own bonds in Japan. In other words, if rates start to rise again, that will only help the US dollar clobber the Japanese yen. You can also see that the Japanese yen is getting the same treatment almost everywhere, so this is most certainly a Japanese Yen situation more than it is a US dollar situation.</p>
      <p>Looking at this chart, I do think that the trend is starting to change, so I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we try to reach towards the top again as the Bank of Japan has dug in its heels when it comes to yield curve control and has reiterated multiple times that it was going to be stuck in it. At the same time, we have the Federal Reserve making it abundantly clear that it is going to stay “tighter for longer”, meaning that monetary policy in the United States will be much more restrictive than many other economies around the world, thereby making the US dollar attractive.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/currencies/eur-usd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Euro</a> has initially pulled back during the trading session on Tuesday but found enough support underneath the 1.06 level to turn things around and show signs of life. The overall market structure of the day seems to be a bit positive, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see the Euro trying to pick up a bit of momentum. The 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.0675 level, and therefore it looks as if it is going to be a bit of resistance.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you need to keep an eye on the fact that we are between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, because they attract a lot of attention. Typically, when a currency pair is sitting between these 2 indicators, it means that there are probably going to be traders in both directions pushing quite hard. Typically, when you find the market in this range, there is an explosive move sooner or later as one side or the other finally loses.</p>
      <p>If we break above the 50-Day EMA, it’s possible that the market goes looking to the 1.08 level. On the other hand, if we break down below the 200-Day EMA, is very likely that we would see a huge move lower. On a break down below the 200-Day EMA, I suspect that we will eventually go down to the 1.03 level, and then eventually the parity level which of course would be an area that would attract a lot of attention. Keep an eye on the interest rate situation in the United States, because recently the 2 year and the 10 year have seen moves higher in yield.</p>
      <p>That does typically help the US dollar, but ultimately this is a situation where the markets are in flux, and therefore a lot of noisy behavior does make significant sense. The European Central Bank has reiterated its mission to keep inflation down to 2%, but at the same time the Federal Reserve has reiterated its attitude of staying tight for longer. Because of this, a lot of choppiness is more likely than not going to be the case going forward, so therefore position sizing will be crucial.</p>

With that being the case, I think this is a market that is now starting to reach a little bit of noise, so perhaps the question now is whether or not we should be switching from the British pound to other currencies against the yen?</p>
      <p>As an example, the New Zealand dollar looks like it’s getting close to breaking out against the Japanese Yen, and while I do believe that the British pound can continue to climb from here, it’s got a lot more noise in the short term to deal with and it has had in the last 48 hours. I certainly wouldn’t short this pair, but I recognize that it has outstretched itself a little bit during the day. With that in mind, I would be cautious, but I would look at pullbacks as a potential buying opportunity.</p>
      <p>Quite frankly, what I would like to see is this market continue to rip higher, because there’s more value to be found in other yen related crosses. For example, the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar all look like they are ready to rip higher against the Japanese yen as well. Simply put, I believe that this chart might be a proxy for what the yen is doing at the moment, because if an overbought condition like this can continue to find buyers, clearly other pairs will have to pay homage to this, and play catch up.</p>

Quite frankly, at this point Japan has no other option but to accept either a weakening currency, or higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>With interest rates around the world climbing overall, it does make a lot of sense the Japanese yen will continue to get hammered as more pressure will be put on the bond market in Tokyo. As the Bank of Japan is the only major central bank in the world offering quantitative easing, the Japanese yen is an easy target for currency traders. With that being the case, not only will the US dollar continue to climb against the Japanese in but is very likely that we will see multiple other currencies do the same. In fact, when you look at the British pound, it is completely ripping the face off of the Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>Just above, the ¥137.50 level is an area that we will need to pay close attention to due to the fact that it was a previous resistance barrier, right along with support. There should be a certain amount of “market memory” in that area, and therefore it’s going to take a significant amount of momentum to break through that area. Short-term pullbacks are very likely, but those will more likely than not end up being buying opportunities.</p>
      <p>The ¥135 level underneath should be support, due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and it is also an area that we have seen quite a bit of noise there in both directions. The 200-Day EMA sits near the ¥134 level, and the 50-Day EMA is getting ready to cross above there in order to form the “golden cross” indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to for a longer-term “buy-and-hold” type of attitude. I have no interest in shorting this pair anytime soon, at least not until the interest rate situation around the world calms down.</p>

      <p>LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped and China's yuan gained on Wednesday after China's manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace since April 2012, while the euro rose after regional German inflation data signalled price pressures remain high.</p>
      <p>The Australian and New Zealand dollars were also among the beneficiaries of the robust Chinese data, which smashed expectations with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) shooting up to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January.</p>
      <p>China's non-manufacturing activity also grew at a faster pace in February, while the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI reading for last month likewise surpassed market expectations.</p>
      <p>The onshore yuan finished the domestic session at 6.8854 per dollar, the strongest close since Feb. 21, while the offshore yuan jumped 1.3% to 6.8683 per dollar, set for its largest one-day gain since late November.</p>
      <p>"The data confirms expectations that the growth outlook has improved quite significantly in China, so it's positive for risk sentiment," said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.</p>
      <p>"This has put the dollar on the defensive."</p>
      <p>The kiwi surged 1.3% to $0.6263, while the Aussie gained 0.7% to $0.6774, reversing the slide to a two-month low earlier on Wednesday following soft domestic economic data.</p>
      <p>The antipodean currencies are often used as liquid proxies for the yuan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, inflation data from five German states was largely unchanged in the high single digits in February, pointing to no let-up in stubborn price pressures at the national level.</p>
      <p>Preliminary pan-German inflation data is to be published at 1300 GMT, calculated using data from up to 16 German states.</p>
      <p>Figures released on Tuesday showed accelerating inflation in France and Spain, two of the euro zone's biggest economies, pushing up expectations for rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
      <p>The euro was last up 0.9% against the dollar to $1.0672 , on track for its biggest daily gain since Feb. 1.</p>
      <p>"The euro is being well supported by the inflation data," Nordea's Christensen said.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for a more solid euro area inflation reading tomorrow than we had expected going into this week."</p>
      <p>Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.2049, although trimmed earlier gains after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said it was possible the central bank had already come to the end of its rate-rising cycle.</p>
      <p>The pound surged 1% at the start of the week after Britain struck a post-Brexit Northern Ireland trade deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar index fell 0.7% to 104.25.</p>
      <p>The index rose nearly 3% in February, its first monthly gain after a four-month losing streak, as a slew of strong U.S. economic data in recent weeks raised market expectations that the Federal Reserve has further to go in hiking rates.</p>
      <p>Futures pricing currently suggests a peak of around 5.4% in the Fed funds rate by September.</p>
      <p>"We see the Fed going to 5.5%, with a growing risk of 6%," said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank. "The Fed is hiking. Others can't follow or match. The dollar will soar."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.65% against the Japanese yen to 135.36, having spiked close to 5% against the yen in February, its largest monthly gain since last June.</p>

        <p>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks edged lower on Tuesday, on track for their biggest February percentage decline in over two decades, as geopolitical risks and fears about U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer cooled demand for riskier assets.</p>
        <p>The MSCI EM equities index slipped 0.5% and was down 6.6% this month, headed for its worst February performance since 2001. A rally in EM stocks at the beginning of 2023 has petered out in recent weeks after signs of strength in the U.S economy fueled fears of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical risks including heightened U.S.-China tensions also weighed on sentiment.</p>
        <p>"It's started to get more challenging for emerging markets," said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</p>
        <p>"We think weakness in the global economy will lead to more risk-off in the next few quarters, providing a difficult backdrop."</p>
        <p>Data on Tuesday showed China's urban employment fell for the first time in six decades last year and per capita spending also marked a rare decline, as harsh COVID-19 curbs ravaged the world's second-biggest economy.</p>
        <p>Stocks in China rose 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 0.8%.</p>
        <p>Regional currencies were muted against a stronger dollar and are set to record their worst month since September 2022.</p>
        <p>The South African rand was down 0.2% ahead of the release of domestic money supply, budget, trade and unemployment data later in the day.</p>
        <p>Russia's rouble was stronger against the U.S. dollar at 74.39. Local media reported that Russia's oil output was back at pre-sactions levels for the first time in February.</p>
        <p>Turkey's lira was flat at 18.8860 after data showed the country's economy expanded 5.6% in 2022, more than expected with growth slowing to 3.5% in the fourth quarter as a decline in demand continued.</p>
        <p>In central and eastern Europe, Hungary's forint edged lower against the euro ahead of an interest rate decision by the country's central bank due later in the day.</p>
        <p>The National Bank of Hungary is widely expected to keep its base rate steady at 13%.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in emerging markets, India's GDP growth likely slowed further in the October-December quarter amid weakening demand and is set to lose more momentum as a series of interest rate hikes weigh on activity, according to a Reuters poll.</p>

        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Tuesday as investors reassess the global economy's outlook given expectations for higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 (<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EFTSE?p=%5EFTSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">^FTSE</a>) dropped 0.74% to 7,876.28 points at close of trading on Tuesday, while the CAC 40 (<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EFCHI?p=%5EFCHI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">^FCHI</a>) in Paris was muted at 7,291 points. In Germany, the DAX (<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGDAXI?p=%5EGDAXI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">^GDAXI</a>) was also flat at 15,383.</p>
        <p>Across the pond, US stocks fell Tuesday at the open, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.34% to 32,775 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.31% to 3,980 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) edged lower by 0.21% to 11,472.</p>
        <p>Traders are increasingly worried that central banks around the globe will remain hawkish in order to bring down persistent inflation.</p>
        <p>“Rishi Sunak’s new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland breathed some life back into the pound yesterday, yet the currency gave back some of these gains on Tuesday as markets took time to digest the information," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p>
        <p>"While the deal may provide a reset for UK/EU relations and be good for the UK economy, reports suggest some in the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] are not fully satisfied by what’s on the table.”</p>
        <p>Inflation figures in Spain and France both rose in February while the latest grocery price survey from Kantar in the UK showed food price inflation hit a record high, up 17.1%.</p>

        <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado (OCDO.L) dropped by 7.81%, the top faller on the FTSE 100 index.</p>
        <p>The online supermarket saw its <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/ftse-100-ocado-loses-more-than-%C2%A3500m-as-shoppers-cut-back-100022496.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pre-tax loss balloon to nearly £501m</a> last year, nearly three times as high as in 2021.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 slipped 0.4% to 7,902, pulled down by poorly received results from Ocado and Croda (CRDA.L), and housebuilders falling in response to Travis Perkins’ cautious outlook in its latest figures.</p>
        <p>The builders’ merchant said it was preparing for ‘more challenged’ private domestic new-build and repair, maintenance and improvement markets.</p>
        <p>Moving in the opposite direction, online electricals retailer AO World (AO.L) was up by 23.38% as it boosted it annual earnings outlook for the third time since November as it said cost-cutting efforts and targeted price rises were paying off.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) rose and was trading at around $83/barrel as demand surged ahead of the release of fresh economic data from China, the world’s largest oil importer and second largest consumer.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EN225?p=%5EN2250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">^N225</a>) rose 0.1% to 27,445 points, while the Hang Seng (<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EHSI?p=%5EHSI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">^HSI</a>) in Hong Kong slipped 0.78% to 19,044.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA closed 0.7% lower Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX fell 0.3% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP edged down 0.1%, according to preliminary data from FactSet.

        <h3>Hong Kong Financial Markets</h3>
        <p>A pedestrian passes by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange electronic screen in Hong Kong, on Wednesday, March 1, 2023. Asian shares were mixed Wednesday as investors watched for upcoming earnings reports and other indicators on how inflationary pressures might be denting global growth. (AP Photo/Louise Delmotte)</p>
        <p>TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were higher Wednesday after reports on key measures of China manufacturing showed a strong recovery after anti-virus controls were lifted late last year.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 3.3% and Shanghai gained 0.9%.</p>
        <p>Purchasing managers’ indexes issued by a business magazine, Caixin, and the official China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing showed gains in production, exports and new orders.</p>
        <p>Business activity is recovering after the ruling Communist Party ended stringent anti-virus restrictions in early December. That followed a slump in activity that dragged last year’s economic growth to 3%, its second-lowest level since at least the 1970s.</p>
        <p>That was good news in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng gained more than 700 points to 20,486.79.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's own outlook has improved as it also has relaxed pandemic precautions. The territory's chief executive, John Lee, announced Tuesday t hat masks will no longer be required both outdoors and indoors, but some high-risk areas including hospitals and elderly homes can still require their use.</p>
        <p>The Shanghai Composite added 28 points to 3,308.53. South Korean markets were closed for a national holiday.</p>
        <p>Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 picked up 0.3% to 27,523.17. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.1% to 7,263.10.</p>
        <p>Wall Street closed out a frigid February with more losses on Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, locking in a loss of 2.6% for the month and closing at 3,970.15. The Dow fell 0.7% to 32,656.70 while the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower to 11,455.54. Both also sank over the month.</p>
        <p>Investors are keeping an eye on the last of the earnings reports for this season. Several big-name retailers are still on the schedule for this week.</p>
        <p>“The consumer and inflation are in focus over the next few days. After last week’s drubbing among retail stocks, the worst since June last year, some upbeat earnings results from Target should buoy the group,” said Brian Overby, senior market strategist at Ally, while warning that more volatility may be in store later this week.</p>
        <p>After a strong start to the year driven by hopes inflation is abating, Wall Street shifted into reverse in February. A stream of data showed inflation and the overall economy are remaining more resilient than expected. That’s forced investors to raise their forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there.</p>
        <p>High rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession down the line because they hurt the economy. They also drag on prices for stocks and other investments. </p>
        <p>Heightened expectations for rates sent yields jumping in the bond market Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.92%. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that shape the economy’s health, and still near its highest level since November. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, ticked up to 4.81% from 4.78%. It’s near its highest level since 2007.</p>
        <p>Reports on the economy released Tuesday showed some slight cracks. One said that confidence among U.S. consumers fell in February. Another said that manufacturing in the Chicago region weakened by more than expected.</p>
        <p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 48 cents to $77.53 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, rose $0.52 to $83.97 a barrel.</p>
        <p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to $136.37 Japanese yen from $136.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.0596 from $1.0583.</p>

      <p>Intel INTC reported Q4 results after market close yesterday. The world’s largest chipmaker missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers.</p>
      <p>As such, shares of INTC plunged about 10% in after-market hours. Given this, ETFs like First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK, and Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJD having the highest allocation to the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will be in focus.</p>
      <h3>Q4 Earnings in Focus</h3>
      <p>Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and the year-ago earnings of $1.09. Revenues declined 32% year over year to $14 billion and came in above the estimated $14.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Client computing, data-center and AI, and network and edge revenues declined 36%, 33% and 1%, respectively. However, accelerated computing systems and graphics, Intel Foundry Services and Mobileye revenues were up 1%, 30% and 59%, respectively (see: all the Technology ETFs here).</p>
      <p>The chipmaker continued to suffer from dismal PC and data-center markets. Shoppers choose to hold on to the laptops and desktops they purchased at the peak of the pandemic. According to Gartner, Q4 worldwide PC shipments declined 28.5%, the biggest decline since the firm started following shipments in the mid-1990s.</p>
      <p>As such, Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share. Both revenue and earnings per share guidance are well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion and 26 cents per share, respectively.</p>

      <p>While Intel INTC and Qualcomm QCOM disappointed investors, Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research Corporation LRCX and Advanced Micro Devices AMD came up with solid earnings reports. As such, semiconductor ETFs remained strong over the past month with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL rising 12.8%, 12.7%, 12.4%, 10.4% and 8.7%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Let’s dig into the individual performances:</p>
      <h3>Semiconductor Earnings in Focus</h3>
      <p>Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers. Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and revenues of $14 billion also came in below the estimated $14.5 billion. Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share (read: Intel Plunges on Earnings Miss, Weak Guidance: ETFs in Focus).</p>
      <p>Texas Instruments reported solid Q4 results topping our earnings estimate by 17 cents and revenue estimate by $84 million. For first-quarter 2023, the company expects revenues in the range of $4.17-$4.53 billion and earnings per share of $1.64-$1.90.</p>
      <p>Lam Research also topped on both revenue and earnings for second-quarter fiscal 2023. Earnings per share of $10.71 strongly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 76 cents, while revenues of $5.28 billion edged past the estimated $5.08 billion. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects revenues of $3.8 billion (+/- $300 million) and earnings per share of $6.50 (+/- 75 cents).</p>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings by three cents and on revenues by $58 million. It expects first-quarter 2023 revenues of $5.3 billion (+/-$300 million), which indicates a year-over-year decline of 10%.</p>
      <p>At Qualcomm, earnings per share of $2.37 for first-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents, while revenues of $9.46 billion fell short of the estimate of $9.56 billion. The company projects revenues of $8.7-$9.5 billion and earnings per share of $2.05-$2.25 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>

      <p>What a difference a year has made in the housing market.</p>
      <p>Toward the end of 2021, homebuilder exchange-traded funds and stocks were at all-time highs, as favorable interest rates, low housing inventories and COVID-19-fueled demand charged the market. Ten months later, the situation has reversed.</p>
      <p>A doubling of mortgage rates, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s five interest rate hikes so far this year, has sent home loan demand into a tailspin. Demand for mortgages hit a 25-year low this month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The spike in mortgage costs as inflation surges and the stock market wallows in bear territory suggests the housing market is set for a major cooldown.</p>
      <p>Indeed, home prices fell at the fastest rate in their history in July from the previous month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices. While July prices were still higher year over year, the immediate picture appears to be turning grimmer. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), which measures homebuilder sentiment, is now at 38, its lowest level since 2012, and less than half its level in April.</p>
      <h3>Significant Downturn</h3>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the two homebuilder ETFs have suffered steep declines and significant outflows this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) were up more than 49% in 2021, while SPY was up nearly 30%. Now the funds are down 34% and 35.5%, respectively, while SPY is down a little less than 24%.</p>
      <p>They’ve also shrunk, with both shedding two-thirds of their assets this year. XHB currently has roughly $840 million, down from $2.5 billion at the end of 2021, while ITB stands at about $1 billion, down from $3.2 billion. Those funds have seen outflows of $959 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, so far this year.</p>
      <p>ITB and XHB launched four months apart in 2006, shortly before the Great Financial Crisis and the last major housing disaster. From the end of June 2006 through mid-2009, XHB was down as much as 75%, while ITB slumped by nearly 85%.</p>
      <p>The last housing crisis, however, didn’t feature record-breaking inflation. So this time around things might be even worse.</p>
      <p>Costs for construction materials remain high even with recent moderation. That, paired with higher financing costs (with more interest rate hikes expected), is creating a double whammy for the industry, which is made worse by the falloff in demand. If the trajectory of homebuilder stocks during the last housing market meltdown is any benchmark, more declines are ahead.</p>
      <h3>Differences Between the ETFs </h3>
      <p>ITB has the broader portfolio, with 50 components in its index, versus 36 stocks in XHB’s index. Lately, the funds have moved in lockstep, but that difference in holdings could be more relevant going forward.</p>
      <p>XHB has nine holdings—with a combined weight equal to nearly one-third of the index, that are not in ITB’s portfolio. None of those actually builds homes; they make things like homebuilding supplies and systems, appliances and furnishings.</p>
      <p>In fact, only about 25% of XHB’s weight is invested in companies that actually build homes, while more than half of ITB’s weight is in those types of companies. The big question is whether that diversification from homebuilding companies will benefit XHB as much when inflation is so high and when interest rates are on an upward trajectory.</p>
      <p>The homebuilding industry appears poised for further tough times. Investors may want to seek shelter elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Semiconductor exchange-traded funds surged after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed Monday it bought more than $4 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the previous quarter.</p>

      <p>Semiconductor exchange-traded funds surged after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. <a href="https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=117058401&type=HTML&symbol=BRK.B&companyName=Berkshire+Hathaway+Inc.&formType=13F-HR&formDescription=Quarterly+report+filed+by+institutional+managers%2C+Holdings&dateFiled=2022-11-14&CK=1067983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">disclosed</a> Monday it bought more than $4 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>ETFs including the <a href="http://etf.com/xsd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD)</a>, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) gained more than 4% and were among the five biggest ETF movers on Tuesday. A handful of Taiwan and semiconductor funds rounded out the top 10 ETF movers.</p>
      <p>Berkshire’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing disclosed 4.12 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to Apple Inc., purchased in the third calendar quarter. Apple is the top holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares have been among the most beaten-down in what has been a declining tech market this year. Even with today’s more than 12% gain, TSMC—as it’s also known—has dropped 32% this year, more than the 27% decline in the tech-heavy <a href="http://etf.com/qqq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)</a>.</p>
      <p>That decline may have been seen as a buying opportunity for Buffett, who, along with business partner Charlie Munger, are the world’s most famous value investors. Semiconductors are generally priced low at present: XSD’s price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times earnings falls beneath QQQ’s 22 times.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Berkshire purchases, geopolitical tensions in the region may have taken a breather after President Joe Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Indonesia Monday and committed to working together to solve economic and security issues.</p>
      <p>China has promised to reunify Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, which the U.S. opposes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s July trip to Taiwan in support of the country infuriated China and led the country to cut off some diplomatic channels with the U.S.</p>

      <p>While actuarial tables and claims adjustments sound boring, market-beating returns are always a good time.</p>
      <p>This year, the <a href="http://www.etf.com/iak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK)</a> has been one of the few stock exchange-traded funds outside of energy that handily topped broader markets like the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>The fund is up about 12% and recently hit its all-time high. It did this in one of the worst equity market environments in years, and without exposure to energy stocks. Energy is the only major sector with positive returns year to date, while the <a href="http://etf.com/spy"></a>SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 16%.</p>
      <p>Three ETFs trading on U.S. exchanges provide exposure to insurance stocks. With 58 holdings, IAK is the broadest that covers this category in addition to being the top performer year to date. With $558 million in assets under management, it’s also the largest compared with the $525 million SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the $347 million Invesco KBW Property & Casualty Insurance ETF (KBWP). Those two funds are up 4.3% and 11.2%, respectively.</p>
      <p>All but one of IAK’s top 10 holdings—including names like Chubb Corp., Progressive Corp. and MetLife Inc.—have notched positive returns during 2022, the majority of them in the double digits. The top firms in the fund have mostly reported strong earnings and revenues this year, boosting their performance in a tough market, and spurring the ETFs gains.</p>
      <p>IAK is probably doing well for a number of reasons, one being that insurance companies do well in unstable economic times because as more or less steady companies, they aren’t affected by the downturn in the economy like other industries. They also provide essential services whose demand profile doesn’t fluctuate with economic cycles.</p>
      <p>Rising interest rates also boost insurance companies’ “float,” the pool of money, collected as premiums, which they invest conservatively and use to make claims payments. The Federal Reserve boosting rates from around zero to 4% Monday has helped IAK’s companies, and with more hikes expected this year and next, the insurance industry may be positioned well for strong profits for some time.</p>
      <p>So far this year, IAK has seen strong inflows, gaining $422.3 million year to date, while KBWP pulled in $248.5 million, and KIE—a broadly based insurance fund like IAK—gained just $62.8 million. With more room to run, those funds could pull in even more.</p>
      <h3>An Analyst’s View</h3>
      <p>The Deloitte Center for Financial Services’ report on its 2023 outlook the insurance industry in September 2022 noted that while insurers are “facing a host of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges,” they exhibited agility during the pandemic in terms of adopting remote work and adapting to customer needs.</p>
      <p>They should continue to maintain that momentum, Deloitte advises, by investing in technology and their workforce while focusing on innovation and their customers.</p>
      <p>The report also notes that ESG considerations will become increasingly important to stakeholders, and that those could be major differentiators in competing within the insurance peer group. The firm declined to comment further when contacted.</p>
      <p>Deloitte U.S. Insurance Leader Karl Hersch said in a video in its outlook that the sector is at a “post-pandemic inflection point” during which it could “reset the narrative” around it.</p>
      <p>While the report cites inflation as cutting into profitability, it notes several opportunities for growth. Those include small businesses, in particular when it comes to cybersecurity-related mishaps.</p>
      <p>The push toward green energy could result in $125 billion in spending on such matters projected by 2030. In the digital realm, including cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse, the report notes that only 17% of related assets are insured.</p>

      <p>One of last year’s top-performing equity exchange-traded funds, the <a href="http://www.etf.com/slx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VanEck Steel ETF (SLX)</a>, stealthily outperformed broader markets. After 2022’s 14% gain, investors may wonder, can it do so again?</p>
      <p>The ETF is the only one covering steel specifically, investing in global steel producers. It manages $101.3 million in assets, only one-fourth of what it managed in 2008. Still, SLX is about the only way to access the performance of steel directly.</p>
      <p>Those outflows may seem surprising. SLX has performed well in in previous years, with three-and five-year annualized returns of 21.2% and 10.2%, respectively. Still, it’s lost nearly $19 million last year despite its positive performance and its indirect exposure to a key global commodity.</p>
      <p>Although nearly half of the portfolio is invested in U.S. equities, the fund also offers exposure to countries like Brazil (19.4%), the U.K. (10.7%) and Italy (5.6%). Top holdings include Rio Tinto plc (12.4%), Vale, S.A. (12.1%) and Nucor Corp. (6.8%).</p>
      <p>SLX’s liquidity isn’t great, with FactSet rating it at the lowest end of its scale, but SLX’s volumes and spreads are within the normal range relative to other similarly sized equity funds. It’s also not likely to close given it has more than $100 million in assets and has been trading for more than 14 years. Its 0.55% expense ratio is at the low end for a specialty equity ETF.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that SLX has a dividend yield for the past 12 months of 4.26% versus 1.65% for the <a href="http://www.etf.com/spy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)</a>.</p>
      <h3>What’s Ahead for Steel</h3>
      <p>Steel price gains may be fairly muted this year after having been driven up by supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war, but nothing too extreme in either direction, according to Christos Rigoutsos, a senior economist with S&P Global.</p>
      <p>“It's not a matter of weakness in pricing—it's the fact that prices will tend [toward] normal rather than actually being weak or lower than that,” he told ETF.com, pointing out that steel prices over the past year have been “sky high” and that the situation is simply normalizing.</p>
      <p>He notes that steel producers will idle production when surpluses of the commodity build up. Add that to the fact that prices are already only slightly above cost, there’s not much downside, according to Rigoutsos. However, he also emphasizes steel is not recession-proof, as manufacturing tends to fall off in that kind of environment.</p>
      <p>Given all that, there may be some upside remaining for SLX, while a similar level of outperformance is unlikely to continue very far into 2023. However, its specific focus and global nature could provide additional diversification to a portfolio with little added risk.</p>
      <p>With recession fears high, a fund focused on companies producing a crucial commodity could be seen as an attractive prospect.</p>

      <p>Allianz Investment Management Head ETF Market Strategist Johan Grahn sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss volatility and market performances amid inflation and the Fed's interest rate hike cycle.</p>
      <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: All right, welcome back to "Yahoo Finance Live." We're going to check on the markets with just a bit before trading closes. Let's see, the Dow falling now 222 points, and check out the S&P and the NASDAQ hovering around the level point. Down just a bit on the S&P, and the NASDAQ just barely in the positive.</p>
      <p>What is ahead for this economy and equities? Let's talk about all of it with Johan Grahn, Allianz Investment Management head ETF market strategist. Nice to see you, sir. Seems like the markets, relatively speaking, holding their breath. What could be the next catalyst around the corner?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, Dave, it's good to see you. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Catalysts? There could be all kinds of catalysts around the corner for you just lurking in the background here. The one thing that we've seen is that we have an environment of increased volatility. And even if it's been coming down a little bit this past week, we're still in a pretty high-volatility environment by historical standards, so to speak.</p>
      <p>So basically it tells you that all the known factors are baked in and that the known factors are bound to swing one way or another, or something new will pop up at any point in time. So it's a good question with a very weak answer for you because it could be a myriad of things.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Well, Johan, when you take into account what's happening today, where we are at current levels here, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how exactly to play this market given all of that uncertainty that you were just talking about. So what's your advice to those who are trying to decide what now is-- I guess what is best to do right now?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Yeah, it really depends on what kind of time you have. And I mean, frankly, most of the assets are sitting in retirement accounts, as you know. So it's really those investors and Americans that have the least amount of time left in their investing careers, so to speak.</p>
      <p>And what it leads to is a fight against this wealth destruction that the Fed has set out to navigate for us, if you will. And what it comes down to is that you have to be more conservative. You've got to think about how you can keep that wealth as opposed to rallying for the highest potential return.</p>
      <p>And there are various ways you can do it, and I think one of the benefits of the current environment, even though it's a silver lining given the volatility that we're in, is that when you look at this market with higher equity volatility and also higher fixed-income volatility, higher rates, it gives you an opportunity to invest in structured products where you can actually set the definition of what you're looking for, and it gives you more upside given the unit of risk that you're mitigating on the downside in an environment like this.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Johan, many just feel that the 10 year is really in control and closing their eyes to the equities right now to the highest we've seen since November, 50-plus basis points this month alone. What does it tell you is around the corner?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, the proverbial Fed tactics are always around the corner, as you know. And we're still looking at this environment where you have the Fed consistently telling the market that you are going to have to be more patient and the market reacting and responding consecutively to all this communication. And it's happened over and over and over again. Every time the Fed comes out to have this conversation, the market will try to call the bluff, and then they have to move aside and say, OK, fine. We'll adjust accordingly, and it keeps happening.</p>
      <p>And I think that right now we might be very much closer to the point where the market is, frankly, catching up to what the Fed has been saying all along, and now we're talking about the duration of how long the Fed is going to keep the rates high and how many more hikes they're going to pursue to get there.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: And you see no pivot until '24, presumably?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: No pivot until '24. The market is still-- there is a little bit of a delta between what the market is pricing in and what the Fed is speaking to the market. But in terms of a real pivot, nothing until 2024 for sure.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether traded little-changed on Tuesday morning in Asia, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell. Polygon led the losers, along with Solana and Shiba Inu. U.S. equities gained ground on Monday after last week’s slump.</p>
      <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin dipped 0.23% in the past 24 hours to trade little changed at US$23,509 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The leading token is holding a seven day loss of 5.34%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum also treaded water at US$1,634, off 0.41%. The token is down 4.05% in the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Polygon’s Matic token posed the biggest drop among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, falling 3.63% to US$1.24, and extending its weekly loss to 16.27%. Polygon Labs, the developer of the Polygon blockchain, said last week it would lay off 20% of its workforce, which was followed by a reported <a href="https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1628522387401482241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">glitch on Polygon’s network</a>.</li>
        <li>Solana lost 2.43% to US$22.69, posting a weekly loss of 13.41%. Solana developers are <a href="https://solana.com/news/02-25-23-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">investigating</a> a network failure on the Solana Mainet Beta last Saturday, which forced it to restart the network and downgrade it from a recent update.</li>
        <li>Shiba Inu dropped 2.53% after analytics firm Lookonchain reported a wallet moving 182 billion Shiba Inu tokens to crypto exchanges on Monday, usually the sign of preparation for selling that can drive prices lower. Last time the same wallet transferred over 200 billion Shiba Inu in December 2022 the price fell more than 7% on the day, according to Lookonchain. The token is down 7.21% for the seven day period.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization edged 0.15% lower to US$1.07 trillion, while the total trading volume jumped 34.55% over the past 24 hours to US$45.70 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities edged higher on Monday after last week’s tumble on concerns about indicators showing inflation remains entrenched. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.22%, the S&P 500 gained 0.31% and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.63%.</li>
        <li>Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/economy/yellen-inflation-debt-ceiling-ukraine/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">told CNN</a> on Monday that U.S. inflation remains too high, but the economy can achieve a soft landing. She said the Federal Reserve’s attempt to curb inflation through higher interest rates while maintaining a strong labor market appears achievable.</li>
        <li>U.S. interest rates are now between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. The January <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20230201.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Federal Reserve</a> meeting minutes released last Wednesday showed policymakers agreed to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes, but warned the tightening cycle is not over.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Census Bureau announced its latest monthly <a href="https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/adv/pdf/durgd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">report</a> on durable goods on Monday, with orders for manufactured goods – excluding transportation – rising 0.7% in January, or below expectations in a sign of a slowdown in the growth that has been feeding inflation.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CME Group</a> predict a 76.7% likelihood the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points in March. They also predict a 23.3% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 27.7% as reported on Monday.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.hsi.com.hk/eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hang Seng</a> Index slipped 0.33% after Hong Kong announced that its exports <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3211687/hong-kongs-exports-fall-367-cent-january-marking-biggest-monthly-drop-70-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dropped 36.7%</a> in January compared to a year ago. The decline in exports is the largest monthly fall in 70 years.</li>

      <p>Tokens of Shiba Inu-themed Floki can soon be used as collateral to borrow a basket of cryptocurrencies on Venus Protocol, the second-largest lending platform on the BNB Chain, Floki developers told CoinDesk on Friday.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a broader plan to make FLOKI, which was originally a meme coin named after billionaire Elon Musk's pet dog, as a serious decentralized-finance (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DeFi</a>) token.</p>
      <p>Venus provides a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing product that allows users to directly borrow against collateral at a high speed while losing less to transaction fees. It held over $800 million in locked tokens as of Friday.</p>
      <p>Venus will be integrating FLOKI in its money-market platform, thereby allowing FLOKI holders on the BNB Chain to borrow USDT, USDC, BNB and a basket of other cryptocurrencies while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
      <p>This allows FLOKI token holders to easily access liquidity without having to sell their tokens.</p>
      <p>The move is expected to benefit FLOKI holders, developers say, as they continue to build and seek strategic partnerships that ultimately benefit the token’s value.</p>
      <p>The FLOKI integration process on Venus has started, and is expected to be completed in March. After that, FLOKI holders will be able to seamlessly lend and borrow on Venus while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>

      <p>On-chain liquidity and derivatives trading protocol Synthetix has deployed version 3 (v3) on the Ethereum mainnet following security audits, developers said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Synthetix (SNX) is a protocol that enables the issuance of synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain – allowing users to mint, hold, and trade a wide range of derivatives – including commodities, fiat currencies, and even stocks.</p>
      <p>The protocol holds over $450 million in locked tokens over the Ethereum and Optimism blockchains as of Thursday. It held just shy of $3 billion in total locked value (TVL) at its February 2021 record high.</p>
      <p>Developers previously stated said that Synthetix v3 will have much more efficient architecture to allow developers to create faster, complex and more efficient decentralized financial (DeFi) applications.</p>
      <p>V3 will allow the creation of products that offer a liquid market for any financial derivative that developers want to build, from traditional financial markets to more exotic markets such as no-loss lotteries or even wholly separate protocols.</p>
      <p>V3 will also offer simplified staking and differentiated debt pools, allowing network stakers to supply collateral to, and receive fees from, specific asset pools without having to be exposed to every Spartan Council-supported asset.</p>
      <p>The Spartan Council (SC) is the central governing body of the Synthetix protocol that votes on overall improvement proposals and parameter changes.</p>
      <p>Synthetix’s native SNX tokens saw nominal price changes in the past 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell in Wednesday morning trading in Asia along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon saw the biggest drop, while BNB dropped the least. A series of economic data in the U.S. released on Tuesday, including earnings reports from retail giants and the rising rate of some Treasury bills, weighed down on equity markets.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin fell 1.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$24,442 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, though it was still up 10% over the past week, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">according to CoinMarketCap</a>. Ethereum fell 2.6% to US$1,658, rising 6.5% over the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Polygon lost 6.1% to US$1.39, though it still booked 10% gains over the past seven days. BNB fell 1.2% to US$311.48, but was still up 5.2% for the week.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.8% to US$1.11 trillion at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The total trading volume over the past 24 hours was up by 3.3% to US$66.70 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday, which was the first trading day of the week, as markets closed on Monday for President’s Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%, the S&P 500 Index dropped 2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day down 2.5%.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The three key indices</a> posted the biggest single-day losses since Dec. 15 as the S&P 500 cut its year-to-date gains in half while the Dow Jones wiped out almost all of its 2023 gains.</li>
        <li>The two-year Treasury note yield rose to 4.7% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 3.9%. Elevated levels in Treasury bond yields represent a larger upside risk for yields, placing downward pressure on equities.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 policy meeting on Wednesday, which investors will look to for hints on how the central bank may act to tackle inflation.</li>
        <li>Retail giants Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc., released their holiday season earnings reports on Tuesday. Walmart’s revenue rose 7.3% to US$164 billion from the previous year, while Home Depot fell short of expectations, reporting US$35 billion in Q4 revenue. Both companies projected a challenging quarter ahead due to headwinds from supply chain shortages and ongoing inflation in the economy.</li>
        <li>Economic <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-business-activity-rebounds-eight-month-high-february-sp-global-survey-2023-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">data released on Tuesday</a> suggested that business activity in the U.S. is expanding. The S&P Global services purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to an 8-month high of 50.5 in February, up from 46.8 in the previous month, while the manufacturing PMI rose to a four-month high of 47.8 from 46.9.</li>
        <li>The Fed raised interest rates to the range of 4.5%-4.75% on Feb.1 to fight the inflation, the highest level since October 2007, with the latest Consumer Price Index data up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CME Group predict</a> a roughly 75% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

      <h3>Coinbase (COIN)</h3>
      <p>Coinbase Global shares jumped after <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-earnings-revenue-losses-beat-expectations-as-volumes-plunge-to-cap-2022-215528339.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the crypto exchange’s fourth-quarter revenue of $629.1 million came in above Wall Street expectations of $581.1 million</a>, according to data compiled by Bloomberg .</p>
      <p>The bar was set relatively low for Coinbase amid a sharp fall in trading volumes last quarter following a decline in crypto prices, the collapse of FTX.com, and increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“Coinbase and crypto proved to be largely resilient in 2022 despite major shocks to the system,” read the company’s shareholder letter. “Idiosyncratic events throughout 2022 exacerbated already weak macro conditions.”</p>
      <p>Coinbase slashed about 20% of its staff in January. The company says it expects a decrease in expenses of more than 30% given its reduced headcount.</p>
      <p>Coinbase shares, which lost about two-thirds of their value over the last year, have rallied sharply since the start of 2023, up roughly 80%. The rise comes amid a resurgence in the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which currently hovers above $24,300 per token.</p>
      <h3>Palo Alto Networks (PANW)</h3>
      <p>Palo Alto Networks’ total revenue <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palo-alto-networks-sees-strong-213114754.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">for the fiscal second quarter 2023 grew 26% year over year to $1.7 billion</a>. Shares of the cybersecurity firm rallied in after hours.</p>
      <p>"We continue to see our teams execute well in the midst of macroeconomic challenges, helping customers consolidate their security architectures," said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date shares of the Palo Alto-based firm are up about 20% amid an overall rise in tech equities. Cybersecurity firms held up relatively well last year compared to the rest of technology stocks, as demand for keeping networks safe grows amid rising geo-political tensions.</p>
      <h3>Caesars Entertainment (CZR)</h3>
      <p>Caesars Entertainment posted fourth quarter net revenue of $2.8 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.</p>
      <p>The gambling company’s results were positively impacted by a continued consumer shift towards spending in services and experiences, from goods.</p>
      <p>"Our fourth quarter delivered another set of strong operating results as both our Las Vegas and Regional segments each set a new fourth quarter record for Adjusted EBITDA,” Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars Entertainment said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
      <h3>Toll Brothers (TOL)</h3>
      <p>Toll Brothers <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toll-brothers-reports-fy-2023-213000282.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">posted first-quarter earnings per share of $1.70 compared to $1.24 for the same period last year</a>. The home builder also gave upbeat guidance after the housing market started to slow down last year.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/stocks-moving.png" alt="ncx-stocks"/>
      <p>“Since the start of the calendar year, we have seen a marked increase in demand beyond normal seasonality as buyer confidence appears to be improving,” Douglas Yearley, Jr., chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers, said in the company's earnings release.</p>
      <p>Toll Brothers reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance for an adjusted gross margin of 27% and an earnings per share range between $8.00 and $9.00.</p>
      <p>U.S. existing home sales fell to the lowest level in more than 12 years in January, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-existing-home-sales-fall-150228036.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors</a>. However the pace of decline slowed, signaling the housing market slowdown could could soon be bottoming.</p>

        <li>Asian markets were mixed on Tuesday. The Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.12% while the Shanghai Composite strengthened by 0.49%.</li>
        <li>“While the current macroeconomic environment may cast a shadow over global exports, and the Fed may still continue with its rate hikes, China’s domestic demand remains robust,” Jack Lee, China A-shares fund manager of Schroders, said.</li>

      <p>STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network, is surging as the recent arrival of the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/07/the-ordinals-protocol-has-caused-a-resurgence-in-bitcoin-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ordinals protocol</a> has unleashed a new narrative of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p>Stacks Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 for smart contracts focused on establishing the world's biggest and oldest blockchain programmable – a dominant feature of Ethereum and its competitors like Solana, which currently account for a majority of global NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.</p>
      <p>Stacks has a separate ledger to store data outside the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications similar to those on Ethereum and Solana. STX, known for being the first token offering qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is used to incentivize Stacks miners and participants in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/29/step-aside-ethereum-blockchain-project-stacks-wants-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">proposed</a> Stacks bitcoin (sBTC) system, which is aimed at making bitcoin fully programmable.</p>
      <p>The token has risen nearly 50% to $0.60 in the past 24 hours, taking the month-to-date gain to 125%. Prices were quoted as high as $0.84 early Monday, the highest since May, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/stacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CoinDesk</a> data show. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin (BTC) has risen just 6% this month.</p>
      <p>The outsized move comes as the crypto community goes gaga over Ordinals, which went live on Jan. 21, allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, Ordinals are like drawing artwork directly on satoshi (sats), the lowest denomination of a bitcoin, while NFTs on Ethereum are analogous to an authenticity certificate from the creator that is separate from ether.</p>
      <p>The number of newly created Ordinals or NFTs inscribed directly into Satoshis on Bitcoin crossed the 100,000 mark last week, causing network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p>Per Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, the growing popularity of Ordinals would bode well for layer 2 solutions.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals on Bitcoin L1 are complementary to Bitcoin NFTs on L2s like Stacks. Ordinals have a natural limit on the L1 scale, and L2s provide a clear scalability path," <a href="https://twitter.com/muneeb/status/1627501257324654592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ali tweeted</a> Monday. "Wallets like Xverse and & Hiro are amongst the first to release or work on Ordinals."</p>
      <p>Activity in NFTs on Stacks has picked up in the wake of the Ordinals' rising popularity. Data from DappRadar shows trading volume on Gamma.io, a Stack-based Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has increased by more than 1,000% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, volumes on Megapont have increased by 125%. Per data tweeted by Ali, there is an active community of artists and creators on Stacks and people have minted 650K Bitcoin NFTs on the layer 2 solution.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin blockchain has been very successful, leading to a general Bitcoin NFT fever," CK Cheung, investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, said. "Stacks is a beneficiary of this as it is an L2 supporting smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin Network. People could mint new Bitcoin NFTs on top of Stacks with a lower cost and higher speed."</p>
      <p>Last week, the bitcoin-focused Web 3 wallet Xverse rolled out support for Ordinals. At the same time, Hiro Wallet added support for inscriptions on its testnet, with Ali describing the same as Metamask for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Early this month, <a href="http://gamma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gamma.io</a> unveiled a no-code creator platform for NFTs on native Bitcoin through the use of ordinals, opening doors for users to create inscriptions without having to run a full Bitcoin node or write any code. Gamma's new launch essentially made Ordinals accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals (inscriptions) are similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the smallest value of Bitcoin (satoshis). This is now opening up the use case for NFTs and merging them with the Bitcoin network security layer," Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in an email while pointing to the upcoming "Building on Bitcoin Hackathon" as the <a href="https://twitter.com/clarity_lang/status/1626661763671371779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">key event</a> to watch out for in the short term.</p>
      <p>The hackathon, scheduled from Feb. 24 to March 7, will have participants build their own smart contracts using Clarity, programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.</p>
      <p>"This virtual hackathon is driving a lot of attention as Stacks uses 'Clarity,' a programming language for writing smart contracts that might be easier to learn than Solidity. The hackathon will reveal in the next two weeks if everybody can now build smart contracts without too much technical knowledge," Thielen noted.</p>
      <p>Finally, on top of all this, STX is seemingly drawing a haven bid, according to Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik.</p>
      <p>"STX is also one of the rare tokens approved by the SEC. So in these uncertain times when the regulator is going after a lot of crypto companies, an SEC-approved token also sounds like a good thing to the market," Malik said.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin fell below US$24,000 in a mixed morning for the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on Monday in Asia. Solana posted the most gains in that list while leading memecoin Dogecoin dropped the most.</p>
      <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin fell 2.76% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$23,927 as of 9:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still up 11.9% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum lost 0.97% to US$1,661, and has gained 11.2% over the past seven days.</li>

The network has been holding its “Build through the Bear” <a href="https://solana.com/grizzlython" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hackathon this month</a>, which invites community members to build on the blockchain, offering US$50,000 in USDC for the top prize. The hackathon ends on March 14.</li>
        <li>Dogecoin fell 2% to US$0.087, but was still trading up 6.6% over the past seven days. XRP slipped 1.7% to US$0.38, though was still trading 3% higher for the past week.</li>

        <li>U.S. equities had a mixed day of trading on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, but the S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index closed the day down 0.6%. Wall Street will be closed on Monday for Presidents’ Day.</li>
        <li>Many major U.S. retailers are slated to release their holiday season <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/19/walmart-home-depot-earnings-preview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">earnings this week</a>, starting with Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. on Tuesday.</li>
        <li>The earning reports are set to come amid growing recessionary concerns in the U.S., as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates from near zero to 4.5% to 4.75% to tamp down on inflation. While some have criticized the Fed for raising rates too sharply, the central bank maintains it will be able to achieve a “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-10/fed-s-harker-favors-rates-above-5-says-soft-landing-odds-grow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">soft landing</a>” to bring down inflation without triggering a recession.</li>
        <li>The latest Consumer Price Index data showed that inflation was up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CME Group predict</a> an 85% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

      <p>Bitcoin is closing in on $25,000 per coin as the entire <a href="https://uk.yahoo.com/topics/crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cryptocurrency</a> market capitalisation rose to $1.17tn.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation was trading at $24,500 on Monday, up 12.4% in the past week.</p>
      <p>The second largest cryptocurrency ethereum <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">(ETH-USD)</a> stood at $1,689 as of the time of writing, up 11.7% in the last seven days.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin shot above $25,000 late on Sunday evening UK time as Asia began the working week, revealing a positive price-movement signal.</p>
      <p>Other cryptocurrencies such as Solana <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOL-USD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">(SOL-USD)</a>, Polkadot <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOT-USD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">(DOT-USD)</a>, and Polygon <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MATIC-USD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">(MATIC-USD)</a> also experienced gains, with increases of 20%, 19%, and 18.5% in the past week respectively.</p>
      <p>Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told Coindesk that $23,000 was bitcoin’s new support level, adding that the coming week would decide whether the digital asset would hit $30,000 or not.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was critical for bitcoin to reclaim $23,000 if we were to see more upside action.</p>
      <p>“With February coming to an end, another bullish monthly close may be what the market needs for bitcoin to test $30,000.”</p>
      <p>On Monday morning bitcoin trader Matthew Hyland tweeted: "Bitcoin lower time frame, really hard to tell if the big breakout above $25.2k comes right here."</p>
      <p>Hyland tweeted a chart that suggested bitcoin would drop to a low of around $22,000 before rebounding above $25,000.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is heading into a quiet week in terms of macroeconomic triggers that could affect the price. There are a few US data releases, such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, coming up.</p>
      <p>All eyes are on the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting being held on 15 and 16 March where a decision for the next benchmark interest rate hike will be made. Futures markets are pricing in a less hawkish Federal Reserve, forecasting a 25 basis point rate hike at the meeting in March.</p>

      <p>Binance sent $400 million to a supposedly independent US trading firm managed by CEO Changpeng Zhao, according to Reuters.REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Binance secretly moved $400 million from its US partner to a trading firm owned by boss Changpeng Zhao, according to Reuters.</li>
        <li>A US-based executive called the transfers "unexpected", saying that "no one mentioned them".</li>
        <li>It's not clear why the money was sent or if any of the funds belonged to US customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Binance secretly moved large sums of money from its supposedly independent US partner to a company managed by the crypto giant's boss Changpeng Zhao, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-giant-binance-moved-400-million-us-partner-firm-managed-by-ceo-zhao-2023-02-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reuters.</a></p>
      <p>The publication said Thursday that Binance's US partner started transferring money to Merit Peak in 2020 and sent the trading firm over $400 million in the first quarter of 2021, citing banking records and company messages.</p>
      <p>Merit Peak is a market-maker trading firm owned by Binance CEO Zhao, who's often referred to by his initials CZ.</p>
      <p>Binance claims that Merit Peak and Binance's US partner Binance.US operate independently from the global exchange, which CZ co-founded in 2017.</p>
      <p>But Binance.US executives didn't know that it had been sending money to Merit Peak and were concerned when this came to light, according to company messages seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>Then-CEO Catherine Coley reportedly asked a Binance executive for an explanation in late 2020, calling the transfers "unexpected" and saying that "no one mentioned them".</p>
      <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has previously probed ties between Binance.US, Merit Peak, and another CZ-owned trading firm called Sigma Chain AG, according to a Wall Street Journal report published in February 2022.</p>
      <p>Binance.US did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment.</p>
      <p>It's not clear why the money was sent from Binance.US to Merit Peak or if any of the funds belonged to US customers.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in November that FTX founder <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ftx-crash-client-funds-alameda-binance-sbf-sec-cftc-probe-2022-11?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sam Bankman-Fried had used at least $4 billion of customers' money to prop up Alameda Research</a>, a supposedly independent trading firm that he managed.</p>
      <p>FTX had already filed for bankruptcy when that story broke but Bankman-Fried was subsequently arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the US to face eight counts of fraud.</p>

      <p>China is the world's No. 2 economy and home to dozens of companies that trade in the U.S. Right now, Pinduoduo parent PDD Holdings (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD">PDD</a>), Canadian Solar (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSIQ</a>), BYD (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYDDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BYDDF</a>), Tencent Holdings (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TCEHY</a>) and Baidu (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BIDU</a>) are China stocks worth watching or potentially buying.</p>
      <p>It's been a tough couple of years for Chinese stocks. The Covid pandemic, and Beijing's zero-Covid policy, have slammed the economy. Meanwhile, regulatory crackdowns vs. technology and data-centric firms such as <a href="https://www.investors.com/research/alibaba-stock-buy-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Alibaba</a> (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BABA</a>), Tencent (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TCEHY</a>) and NetEase (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NTES</a>) have been a major headwind. The tech crackdown seems to have eased.</p>
      <p>U.S. tensions are a concern. In recent months, the White House has barred shipments of key chip technology to China, adding to tariffs and other curbs on Chinese goods. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China has rolled back Covid restrictions significantly. With an end to lockdowns and other severe controls, a massive wave of infections took hold. But investors are looking beyond to brighter days ahead. With China New Year holidays out of the way, will the Chinese economy finally rebound?</p>
      <p>While the current top China stocks to buy or watch are dominated by e-commerce plays, don't forget EV startups such as Nio (NIO) and Li Auto (LI). Like global giant BYD (BYDDF), all are taking on Tesla (TSLA) in the world's largest EV market.</p>
      <h3>Tencent Stock</h3>
      <p>Tencent is China's messaging and gaming giant, with major payments exposure and with key holdings in an array of Chinese companies, including JD.com.</p>
      <p>Earnings have declined for the past four quarters, and revenue for the past two, as a big crackdown on internet platforms and new mobile games took a toll. Earnings growth is expected to return in 2023.</p>
      <p>JD.com stock peaked at 94.46 in February 2021, tumbling to a five-year low of 23.52 on Oct. 24, 2022. Since then shares have doubled, vaulting above moving averages</p>
      <p>Shares hit 52.88 on Jan. 27 and have pulled back. TECHY stock has fallen below its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Ideally, Tencent would forge a new base after its big run.</p>
      <p>Tencent stock is listed in Hong Kong and trades over the counter in the U.S.</p>

      <p><a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/bitcoin-changes-little-as-u-s-inflation-cools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bitcoin</a>, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 8.86% in the week from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17, trading at US$23,764  at 7 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. <a href="https://forkast.news/what-is-ethereum-and-how-can-it-become-the-future-of-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ether</a> strengthened 7.86% in the same period to change hands at US$1,665.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-24-1.webp" alt="ncx-blog"/>
      <p>Bitcoin saw this week’s second-biggest gains among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, followed by Polygon’s Matic that rose 13.33% to US$1.44.</p>
      <p>“I am expecting a slightly sideways move. The market has to calm a little before any further impulses,” wrote Aziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange <a href="https://gammax.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GammaX</a>, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
      <p>“There is massive support and a strong buy orders wall which might push Bitcoin further towards US$29,000-30,000 in early March. However, there also is a strong support zone at US$22,250. If that support withholds, we might see another impulse toward US$25,300,” wrote Kenjaev, adding that “there will be more speculations over the SEC and Paxos, so keep your newsfeed open.”</p>
      <p>Kenjaev sees less correlation between traditional and crypto markets, as prices are mainly driven by industry developments.</p>
      <p>“The cryptocurrency market is more focused on developments inside its own ecosystem and the connectivity of this decentralized ecosystem to the centralized one. Hence, every development related to the regulators vs crypto companies, especially U.S. regulators, does and will affect the crypto market,” wrote Kenjaev.</p>
      <p>“Be mindful of the release, testing, deployment and adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The major macroeconomic data I would like to see is the national debt. There has been a lot of money spent in recent years and governments will be looking to recover it,” wrote Kanjaev, adding that “the government knows that there is a good portion of funds floating in Web3.”</p>
      <p>The global crypto market cap stood at US$1.09 trillion on Friday at 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 6.86% from US$1.02 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$458 billion market cap represented 42.2% of the market, while Ether accounted for 18.7%.</p>
      <h3>Biggest Gainers</h3>
      <p>Astar Network’s Astr token was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Astar Network is a multi-chain smart contract network focused on Web3 innovation.</p>
      <p>Astr rallied 51.72% this past week to change hands at US$0.1099 after the announcement of its partnership with Sony to launch a Web3 incubation program to support developers building Web3 projects.</p>
      <p>Decentralized gaming developer <a href="https://treasure.lol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Treasure</a>’s Magic token was the second biggest gainer, up 44.94% to trade at US$2.18. The token started its rally on Feb. 13, after the company <a href="https://twitter.com/Treasure_DAO/status/1616558704299761664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">launched</a> a new Game Builders Program supported by Arbitrum to incentivize high-potential games building on Treasure, by offering developers access to open-source code as well as advisory and marketing support.</p>
      <h3>Next Week</h3>
      <p>For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, a “death cross” appeared on its weekly chart. This meant that the 50-week small moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator, stood below the 200-week SMA for the first time.</p>
      <p>Kasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm <a href="https://www.musca.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Musca Capital</a>, said that the death cross “gives very little input,” since it only shows that Bitcoin price performed better in the last 50 weeks compared to the last 200 weeks.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin prices charted another significant formation, with its first “golden cross” on the daily timeframe since the beginning of the crypto bear market in November 2021. A golden cross means that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. Historically, Bitcoin has charted multiple golden crosses in previous cycles before a sustained rally.</p>
      <p>“A record high 66.9% of circulating BTC has not moved in over a year,” tweeted Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, adding that “Bitcoin bear markets end when there are no sellers remaining, the price slowly starts drifting up due to (any) marginal buyer, and the next wave of adopters learn BTC is the least uncertain money.”</p>
      <p>According to Kenjaev, this suggests that Bitcoin holders were more conservative. “They are waiting for the right time to sell and are hedging over the upcoming recession. The state of the global economic conditions now leads to more uncertainty than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The reason why the situation is not changing with current global developments is that investors do not see the same scenario happening. Current market conditions look risk-attractive and favorable, although it’s very early to call it the next bull run. We shall at the very least wait for improvements from regulatory bodies globally.”</p>
      <p>“Some patterns suggest that an ideal scenario for Bitcoin would be to drop near US$19,500-19,300,” he added, hoping for “a decline to US$19,500 and a jump to US$30,000.”</p>
      <p>On Feb. 12, Blockstream chief executive officer Adam Back <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1624844122363244544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">predicted</a> that Bitcoin would exceed US$200 million in market cap, bringing BTC prices to US$10 million by 2032.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether rebounded in Thursday morning trading in Asia amid broad gains in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies after a bout of profit-taking and mixed economic indicators sent prices lower on Wednesday. Solana, Polygon and Cardano led gains among the top 10 by market capitalization. U.S. equities were mixed overnight. Tesla beat earnings forecasts but the poor outlook from Microsoft on Wednesday and an interest rate hike expected next week kept a lid on trading.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin rose 2% to US$23,096 in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen 11.66% in the seven days to date and resumed a strong run up since the start of the year after hitting a speed bump on Wednesday. Ether added 3.43% to US$1,610, up 6.36% in the same week, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CoinMarketCap data</a>.</li>

      <p>BNB could oscillate in a range in the next few hours/days.</p>
      <p>Short-term holders saw a sharp decline in profits after Tuesday’s sudden drop.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin [BTC] dropped from $23k to below $22.5k on Tuesday, pulling the altcoin market into a short-term plunge. <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/?s=BNB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Binance Coin [BNB]</a> declined by 9% in the same period, dropping from $323 to $293. </p>
      <p>However, bulls found steady support of around $297 and launched a price recovery. At press time, BNB’s value was $303.6o and could oscillate in the range below for the next few hours/days. </p>
      <h3>BNB remained steady at the $300 – $310 range</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>On the three-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded from the 40 level and showed that buying pressure increased after dropping to the 40-mark.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was rejected at the zero mark, forcing it into an uptick on the positive side, which indicated that the BNB market was strengthening.</p>
      <p>Therefore, BNB could oscillate between the demand zone ($293 – $300) and $310 in the next couple of hours. BNB has traded within this range since 21 January, only to witness a false breakout on 24 January. A retest of the $319 could also be likely if BTC reclaims the $23k zone.</p>
      <p>However, BNB could drop below the demand zone if BTC breaks below $22.5k, invalidating the bias described above. But such a drop could settle on the 100-period EMA (exponential moving average) or $286.9 level.</p>
      <p>Swing traders should therefore track RSI rejection at the 50-mark, CMF crossover, and BTC price action to minimize risk exposure.</p>
      <h3>Short-term holders’ profits tanked and sentiment flipped into negative</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>According to Santiment, BNB’s 30-day MVRV (market value to realized value) dropped from 36% to 6% at press time. Short-term holders’ profit tanked by 30% as BNB’s price correction wiped out recent gains.</p>
      <p>The price decline was also followed by an elevated negative weighted sentiment and a drop in demand in the derivatives market, as evidenced by the drop in the Funding Rate. However, the Funding Rate rested on the neutral line and any increment could boost BNB’s recovery.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, a further drop in the Funding Rate could set BNB to retest the demand zone below $300. Moreover, the active address in the past 24 hours also dropped, but there was a slight uptick at press time. Any further increase in active addresses could boost the recovery momentum.</p>

      <p>By Stephen Culp</p>
      <p>NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced in choppy trading on Thursday as investors grappled with an onslaught of economic data and a string of mixed corporate earnings, all while eyeing the clock as it ticks down toward next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.</p>
      <p>While all three major U.S. stock indexes were green, megacap momentum stocks, buoyed by Tesla Inc's earnings beat and upbeat sales forecast, helped put the Nasdaq in the lead.</p>
      <p>A raft of data showed the U.S. economy fared better in the fourth quarter than analysts expected, and the labor market remains tight, despite some signs of weakening demand. This is a double-edged sword for investors, as it could embolden the Fed to keep key interest rates at restrictive levels for longer.</p>
      <p>While financial markets have largely priced in a 25 basis point rate from the central bank next Wednesday, that sentiment is not unanimous.</p>
      <p>The data "suggests a 50-basis-point rate hike next week and 25 basis points in March, and then possibly an end to the tightening cycle," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "I think the Fed wants to make sure that the markets don’t get ahead of themselves."</p>
      <p>"(The Fed tightening) hasn't worked its way through the system, but you’re beginning to see cracks in consumption and inflation," Cardillo added. "I'm sure the Fed is going to take note of that."</p>
      <p>Fourth-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with more than one fourth of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 69% have beaten consensus estimates, up from 67% on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Analysts now see aggregate fourth quarter earnings falling 2.7%, worse than the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1, but an improvement over the 3% annual decline as of Wednesday, per Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.4 points, or 0.26%, to 33,831.24, the S&P 500 gained 24 points, or 0.60%, to 4,040.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 122.49 points, or 1.08%, to 11,435.85.</p>
      <p>Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy led the percentage gainers, boosted by rising crude prices due to signs of increasing demand from China.</p>
      <p>Tesla Inc provided the most upside muscle to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, its shares jumping 9.4% in the wake of its earnings report.</p>
      <p>Chevron Corp announced it would triple its budget for share buybacks, which sent the oil major's stock up 4.4%.</p>
      <p>Among losers, IBM Corp fell 4.3% in the wake of its announcement that it would cut jobs divest some assets after falling short of its annual cash target.</p>
      <p>Southwest Airlines Co slid 4.0% after warning of current quarter losses.</p>
      <p>And despite forecasts of strong demand for air travel in 2023, the broader S&P 1500 Airlines index was off 1.6%.</p>
      <p>That might have something to do with Mastercard Inc's disappointing current quarter revenue forecast, cited an expected diminishing pent-up travel demand. The consumer payments company's shares were down 1.7%.</p>
      <p>Mastercard rival Visa Inc is due to post results after the bell, as is chip bellwether Intel Corp.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 26 new lows (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Johann M Cherian and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)</p>

      <p>The S&P 500 metric showed a price correction while Ethereum continued an uptrend.</p>
      <p>Percent Supply in Profit was over 67% at press time, representing a four-month high for Ethereum.</p>
      <p>The price of <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/?s=ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ethereum [ETH]</a> rose dramatically over the last few days, which indicated a bull trend. Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum and equity prices go in opposite directions</h3>
      <p>Recent information indicated that Ethereum’s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment’s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.</p>
      <p>When the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor’s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.</p>
      <h3>Percent Supply in Profit hits four-month high</h3>
      <p>Besides the stock market’s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.</p>
      <p>The graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <h3>MVRV shows reduced loss</h3>
      <p>When the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-latest-update-could-get-eth-holders-excited-for-2023-because/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ethereum</a>.</p>
      <p>Though a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <h3>Ethereum remains in the overbought zone</h3>
      <p>A daily timeframe chart of Ethereum’s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory.</p>

      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/sp.png" alt="bitcoin s&p"/>
      <p>This article is the first in what I hope will be a regular weekend series. A variety of technical analysis techniques will be used to look at probable moves for the S&P 500 (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY?hasComeFromMpArticle=false&source=content_type%253Areact%257Csection%253Amain_content%257Cbutton%253Abody_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SPY</a>) in the week ahead. No personal bias will be shown and no predictions will be made either. Rather, the market will be viewed in probable outcomes using inflection points - if it is going down, where is it likely to go? If it is going up, where is it likely to test? Likewise, if it breaks a key level to the downside, what does that tell us about the market and where is it likely to go?</p>
      <p>The technical analysis itself will be kept fairly simple. After all, one line drawn from the early 2022 top and through the peaks has been the main technical barrier all last year and continues to be important. Tried and tested techniques such as classic patterns, trendlines, major moving averages and horizontal support form the body of the analysis. Demark systems are also used to detect exhaustion and volume profile shows additional areas of interest.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 chart will be analyzed on monthly, weekly and daily timeframes, then the information collated into an actionable summary at the end.</p>
      <h3>The Market Narrative</h3>
      <p>While the focus of this article is primarily on technical analysis, a more complete picture combines it with fundamental and sentiment studies.</p>
      <p>Last week saw the sixth consecutive drop in inflation and there is now plenty evidence it should continue to fall. The Fed won this particular battle. However, the labor market, and particularly wage growth, remain a risk to any further shift away from the hawkish stance. For now, the message from the Fed is that rates will stay high for an extended period.</p>
      <p>But is this warning just a bluff to keep markets from getting too bullish too quickly? The market seems to think so - the expectation is that the Fed are going to slow the pace of hikes to a halt over the coming months and then start cutting in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>The question next week and beyond is whether this situation merits the bullish breakout brewing on the charts. Sentiment has improved drastically in recent months and is reflected already in today's price. A Fed pivot has been a primary driver for months. What is left to continue the rally? Easing in the labor market and confirmed dovish signals from the Fed would complete the bullish narrative, but neither are going to happen next week. Personally, I wouldn't trust the rally until a weekly close above 4050.</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Monthly</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The monthly chart shows the SPX trading inside the range set in December. Resistance is at the range high of 4101 and beyond that, 4325 at the high of August. Support is at December's low of 3764 and the 3491 low.</p>
      <p>There are no exhaustion signals in either direction (using Demark methods).</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Weekly</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>Last week's bar closed near the highs. This gives an upside bias into early next week to at least take out last week's 4003 high.</p>
      <p>Resistance comes in at 4048.5 at the 50ma, which will drop to around 4045 next week. There is also trendline resistance (or the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern) near the same level at 4040. If this area is broken, 4101 is the next resistance, then 4203 at the large weekly gap. Support is at the 3764 pivot low and the 200ma at 3680.</p>
      <p>Again, there are no exhaustion signals in either direction.</p>
      <p>The trend is down (lower lows and lower highs).</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Daily</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The daily chart is at a very important juncture. Friday's session closed at 3999 which was above the 200dma at 3981 and above the trendline at the same level.</p>
      <p>Resistance has been cleared and now only comes from higher timeframe references. Initial support is at 3928 and the gap, then last Tuesday's low of 3877.</p>
      <p>There are no exhaustion signals but a sell set up is now on bar 6. This could become active on Tuesday and Wednesday (bars 8 and 9) and suggests a pause/pullback could materialize.</p>
      <p>The trend is neutral/up. Price is above all major MAs and the bearish trendline.</p>
      <h3>Scenarios for Next Week</h3>
      <strong>Bullish</strong>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, there is a bullish bias due to the strong weekly close and the close above the daily 200ma and trendline. A test of weekly resistance at 4040-45 therefore looks likely. If this breaks, it should bring the monthly resistance of 4101 into play, with 4203 a stretched target above that.</p>
      <strong>Bearish</strong>
      <p>Exhaustion signals could trigger on Tuesday/Wednesday should there be a rally early in the week. Failure to break 4040-45 could flip the view bearish/neutral if it leads to a drop back under 3975-80 and the 200dma/trendline which is declining by around 3 points a day. Daily references of 3928 and 3877 could then be tested, with 3764 good weekly support and unlikely to be broken.</p>
      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>The S&P 500 is testing very important technical resistance and looks to be making a bullish breakout following the positive CPI report last week. One thing to note is that this is a rather obvious and closely watched move and it still needs to clear weekly resistance at 4040-45 and hold its gains to cement a bullish look.</p>

      <p>Solana was on track to bring some developments to its network.</p>
      <p>SOL’s TVL and price suffered a decline while NFT trades ran smoothly.</p>
      <p>Solana [SOL] has been locked in FUD for a long time, affecting its price drastically. However, the network had some positives to show as its development continued.</p>
      <p>After rumors surfaced linking the Solana ecosystem to the troubled <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/ftx-ceo-john-rays-congressional-testimony-reveals-sbfs-poor-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FTX and SBF</a> debacle, SOL came under close examination. The FTX incident left a lasting impression on the network, and the corresponding FUD was difficult to dispel.</p>
      <p>It appeared, however, that Solana had not let up on the gas in its pursuit to prove its worth. Given current statistics, how well has this worked out?</p>
      <h3>Upcoming updates</h3>
      <p>The Firedancer is an upcoming improvement <a href="https://messari.io/report/solana-ecosystem-overview?utm_source=twitter_messaricrypto&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=solana_ecosystem_overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scheduled</a> for rollout on Solana to bolster the reliability of its network. Formed by Jump Crypto, Firedancer is a decentralized validator client written in C++.</p>
      <p>After going live, Solana will join Ethereum as the second multi-client chain. The likelihood that a flaw may cause severe damage to the network is reduced when numerous sets of code exist that can “run” the chain from scratch. </p>
      <p>Additionally, in the event of a flawed implementation, the network gains from a second, unrelated implementation are less likely to suffer from the same flaws simultaneously. Similarly, Firedancer will be released in 2020 and can provide significant performance boosts.</p>
      <h3>Dev activity resumes an upward trend</h3>
      <p>There was some relief after Solana suffered from a noticeable decline. Development on Solana was steadily picking up, according to the Development Activity statistic at press time. Dev activity, according to the metric, was approximately 20.2.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-SOL-13.33.27-16-Dec-2022.png" alt="santiment" />
      <h3>Active developers reduce on Solana and other blockchains</h3>
      <p>Data from the Token Terminal also showed a decline in developers working on well-known blockchains. Because of the decrease in Solana’s developers from over 2,000 to 75, the number of active developers in the general crypto space fell from 3,700 to roughly 1,600.</p>
      <p>This would imply that the drop in Solana affected the crypto industry.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-active-developers.png" alt="token-terminal" />
      <h3>Price and TVL face sharp decline</h3>
      <p>In recent weeks, SOL’s price has been stagnant at best. It was trading at roughly $13 at the time of this writing, a sharp decline from its $30 price at the start of November 2022.</p>
      <p>The Price Range statistic revealed that Solana lost 60% of its value since the last time it was in the $30 range. The low volume, devoid of any significant spikes – indicated by the volume indicator – showed that the asset had not been traded actively in recent weeks.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SOLUSD_2022-12-16_13-33-39.png" alt="Tradingview" />
      <p>A review of Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">revealed</a> that it had drastically decreased in value. The TVL observed was still over $1 billion as of October.</p>
      <p>However, it was discovered that the current worth was around $280 million. The TVL showed a severe decline to which the FTX event and the current market trend contributed.</p>
      <h3>NFT trade remains active</h3>
      <p>The NFT measures provided some promise despite the negative trends shown in the SOL price and Solana’s TVL. Solana was still active, as indicated by the Total NFT trade Volume statistic, expressed in USD. The statistic revealed that <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/solana-nfts-enjoy-some-limelight-but-sol-prefers-to-lurk-in-the-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NFT sales</a> on the network had sales of over $1.4 million on 6 December alone.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-SOL-13.33.20-16-Dec-2022.png" alt="santiment" />
      <p>Additionally, Helium will switch to the Solana network in the first quarter of 2023, according to the Helium Foundation. This is despite the present difficulties of the Solana network. The network hasn’t ceased developing despite its challenges; therefore, it might endure and emerge from the FTX fallout.</p>

      <p>A tweet by the blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment in the past day shows that several altcoins have seen “big upticks in address activity and dormant wallets awakening to move their funds.” The tweet read: “Others [altcoins] are staying stuck in the mud and are more likely to fall behind.”</p>
      <p>Santiment focused on three altcoins in its latest report such as Uniswap (UNI), Ren (REN), and yearn.finance (YFI).</p>
      <p>One example of an altcoin that has seen its network activity increase quite impressively after a consolidation period is YFI, according to the blockchain intelligence firm.</p>
      <p></p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the report showed that network activity for REN did not pick up as much as YFI because of the project’s “complicated financial situation.”</p>
      <p>Lastly, UNI experienced strong growth before when the project announced its NFT marketplace. Network activity for UNI has continued to grow, even compared with the NFT-related pump, according to the report.</p>
      <p>At press time, YFI is trading at $6,257.01 following a 2.63% drop in price over the last 24 hours. This is according to the crypto market tracking website, CoinMarketCap. The altcoin’s price has also weakened against Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by 0.80% and 0.98%, respectively.</p>
      <p>REN on the other hand, is up 2.88% over the last 24 hours. In addition to strengthening against the U.S. dollar, REN’s price has become resilient against BTC and ETH by 4.80% and 4.61%, respectively.</p>
      <p>UNI is also currently down 1.52%, but, it strengthened against Bitcoin by 0.44% and also strengthened against ETH by 0.24% over the same time period.</p>

      <p>Around 13% of the American population — or 43 million people — have held cryptocurrency at some point in their lives, new research from JPMorgan Chase has revealed.</p>
      <p>According to a Dec. 13 report titled "The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use,” this number has risen dramatically since before 2020, when the figure was only around 3%.</p>
      <p>The latest data from JPMorgan comes from analyzing checking account transfers from a sample of over 5 million customers. It found that 600,000 customers in this sample group transferred cash to crypto accounts at some point during period from 2020 to 2022.</p>
      <p>The study also noted that cryptocurrency holders typically made their first crypto purchases during spikes in crypto prices. During this time, the amount of cash being sent into crypto exchange accounts typically far outweigh the cash being removed. In other words, most people were holding onto their crypto during this time period.</p>
      <p>This changed in early 2022 as crypto prices fell, according to JPMorgan. In recent months, cash transfers into crypto exchanges have only slightly exceeded cash transfers out of them.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan says that this is a result of both price declines in crypto and a broader trend of the savings rate declining in the United States since the pandemic:</p>
      <p>“We view the rise and fall of crypto use since the onset of COVID as consistent with the joint relationship between retail flows and market prices seen in prior research. Additionally, the trend in crypto flows also tracks dynamics of household savings, which spiked to historic highs early in the pandemic but has begun to reverse.”</p>
      <h3>Who's buying?</h3>
      <p>The report also weighed in on whether certain demographic groups are more likely to buy crypto. It found that men of all ages buy significantly more crypto than women, and that younger people buy significantly more than older people. For example, the report found that over 25% of millennial men have bought crypto, whereas only around 12% of millennial women and 5% of male baby boomers have.</p>

      <p>he research also found that crypto holdings were relatively minor for most individuals, with median flows equal to less than one week’s worth of take-home pay. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, about 15% of crypto owners had more than a month’s pay invested in crypto</p>

      <p>The crypto market has gone through a dramatic fall in 2022. Bitcoin has fallen from a 2022 high of $47,459 in March to $17,208 at the time of writing, while Ether has fallen from $3,521 in April to $1,273 at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>This fall in the crypto market has been the result of market shocks such as TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/terra-peg-mechanism-in-doubt-as-ust-crashes-to-67-cents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">losing its peg</a> in May and crypto exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bankruptcy-court-told-ftx-and-alameda-owe-blockfi-1b-but-it-s-complicated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FTX going bankrupt</a> in November.</p>
      <p>Trading fees have fallen on many crypto exchanges, and Coinbase has even stated that its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-ceo-says-trading-revenue-has-fallen-to-roughly-half-what-it-was-last-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">revenue has fallen</a> by nearly 50%.</p>
      <p>But despite this decline in crypto prices and trading activity, this new report indicates that crypto ownership has still increased over the course of the last few years.</p>

      <p>PayPal PYPL joined forces with ConsenSys in a bid to expand its offerings in the booming cryptocurrency space and expand its customer reach.</p>
      <p>Per the terms, PayPal has been added as an option for cryptocurrency transactions to ConsenSys’ MetaMask, which is a digital cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
      <p>Notably, users of MetaMask will now be able to buy and transfer the second-most-popular cryptocurrency called Ether seamlessly by just tapping the “buy” button and logging into their PayPal accounts.</p>
      <p>The underlined integration will aid MetaMask in expanding its reach to customers using Web3 applications like play-to-earn games and metaverse applications, among others.</p>
      <p>Similarly, PayPal will also be able to gain traction among Web3 application users, whose number is rising rapidly.</p>
      <p>Currently, the PayPal option within MetaMask is available to selected U.S. users. The feature will be rolled out eventually across the United States.</p>
      <h3>PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus</h3>

      <p>PayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. Quote</p>
      <h3>Growing Crypto Efforts</h3>
      <p>The latest move bodes well for the company’s strengthening crypto initiatives.</p>
      <p>Apart from the latest move, PayPal offers a feature called crypto on Venmo, which lets Venmo customers buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly within the Venmo app. Customers can also check cryptocurrency trends from the app. </p>
      <p>Further, the company offers its cryptocurrency service in the United Kingdom, which allows users to buy, hold and sell digital currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin directly from their PayPal accounts.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s acquisition of a digital asset security technology provider — Curv — remains noteworthy.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of a feature called Checkout with Crypto, which allows customers to seamlessly convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency at the checkout, is another positive.</p>
      <p>With all these endeavors, PayPal remains well-poised to penetrate the booming cryptocurrency market rapidly amid the pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of digital currency transactions.</p>
      <p>Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.2% between 2022 and 2030.</p>
      <h3>Competitive Scenario</h3>
      <p>We note that the latest move, along with the above-mentioned efforts, is likely to strengthen PayPal’s competitive position against one of its biggest peers, Block SQ.</p>
      <p>Block facilitates the buying and selling of bitcoins via its Cash App. It also intends to develop a bitcoin mining system, with the help of which it strives to carry out the processes of mining, maintaining, setting up and purchasing bitcoin efficiently.</p>
      <p>Apart from Square, Shopify SHOP is also leaving no stone unturned to gain a strong foothold in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
      <p>Shopify allows its merchants to accept payments in bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies. It recently took a step further in the crypto market by making its platform NFT-enabled, which allows users to mint and trade collectibles.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, PayPal’s strong crypto initiatives and the growing crypto volume are likely to strengthen its position in the intensifying cryptocurrency battle against the above-mentioned companies.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider</h3>
      <p>Currently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector can consider a better-ranked stock like Arista Networks ANET, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
      <p>Arista Networks has lost 8.9% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ANET is currently projected at 17.5%.</p>

      <p>Avalanche recently announced the launch of the mobile version of its Core Wallet.</p>
      <p>Avalanche’s latest developments have caused AVAX to rally by over 5% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ambcrypto.com/avalanche-performance-on-this-front-is-to-blame-for-its-bearish-price-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Avalanche</a> has recently started rolling out new features and forming new alliances to impact the ecosystem. Owners of AVAX have been forced to grasp onto hope despite these actions because the effects have been minimal if any at all. However, the most recent developments revealed by the ecosystem may attract new users and impact AVAX.</p>
      <h3>Mobile core wallet</h3>
      <p>On 13 December, Avalanche <a href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1602720454539874304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">announced</a> the release of its Core Wallet app for mobile devices. In its initial release in June of this year, the Core wallet had native Avalanche bridging capabilities, allowing users to connect with dApps on the Avalanche network.</p>
      <p>In the past, users who wished to transfer their assets to the network had to resort to third-party tools like MetaMask, which offered a similar Ethereum-Avalanche bridge.</p>
      <p>Avalanche’s latest change could pave the way for the company to attract more consumers. This has the potential to boost both ecosystem participation and user count.</p>
      <p>The network claimed that the Core wallet’s other distinctive features included the ability to trade Avalanche, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-traders-can-keep-an-eye-on-these-levels-as-btc-drops-into-a-demand-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> easily, and <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/cftc-again-calls-ethereum-eth-a-commodity-in-a-court-filing-details-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ethereum</a> assets. Also, the transfer of Bitcoin and Ethereum to participate in Avalanche DeFi dApps, and track real-time asset price movements in a unified watchlist. </p>
      <h3>Avalanche’s recent partnership</h3>
      <p>Avalanche has also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1602745689926008833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">launched</a> a learn-and-earn program in collaboration with Robinhood. By incorporating Robinhood’s “learn and earn” feature, the ecosystem would be able to onboard a wider variety of users.</p>
      <p>In related news, Avalanche had also recently <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/avalanche-and-alibaba-partnership-may-have-this-effect-on-avax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">established</a> a relationship with Alibaba Cloud. As a result of the collaboration, the platform would be offering Node-as-a-Service. This service would allow any operator interested in running a node to do so by simply connecting to an already-built architecture without a complex set-up.</p>
      <h3>AVAX in daily timeframe</h3>
      <p>By taking a glance at AVAX in a daily timeframe, it was possible to see more clearly how these feature enhancements and partnerships are yet to have the expected impact.</p>
      <p>The asset’s price movement trend was underwhelming when examined. But it was clear that it had increased by more than 5% over the preceding trading period.</p>
      <p>This would imply a favorable reaction to the network’s most recent news. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading with less than a 1% increase in value, and it appeared to be rising.</p>

      <p>Aave grew on the Arbitrum network but declined on Ethereum</p>
      <p>Arbitrum’s TVL witnessed growth, and the number of transactions on the protocol rose</p>
      <p>According to new data from <a href="https://dune.com/queries/1238683/2122874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dune Analytics</a>, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/?s=aave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aave [AAVE]</a> users on Arbitrum witnessed major growth. More and more users have increasingly switched to Arbitrum, indicating that L2 adoption was rapidly rising.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ARB-ETH.jpeg" alt="What does aave growth on arbitrum" />
      <p>Arbitrum is a major layer 2 solution that has been contributing to the growth of the sector. Its TVL grew tremendously over the last few weeks and sat at 1.08 billion at the time of writing after appreciating by 1.24% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>However, despite the TVL growth, Arbitrum’s activity and TPS were unable to rise. The latter declined by 26.78%, according to data from <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">L2beats</a>.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hp-image.png" alt="defiLama"/>
      <p>Regardless of the momentary decline in Arbitrum’s TPS, the number of transactions on the protocol grew significantly since September. Even though there was volatility observed in the number of transactions, overall, the number of transactions kept moving in a positive direction.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the number of unique users on the L2 protocol increased from 1.7 million to 12.16 million in the last month, according to <a href="https://arbiscan.io/chart/address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Arbiscan</a>.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-11-at-1.28.31-PM.png" alt="arbiscran"/>
      <h3>State of Aave on Ethereum</h3>
      <p>The growing presence of Aave on Arbitrum had a correspondingly negative impact on Aave’s presence on the <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/category/ethereum-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ethereum [ETH]</a> network.</p>
      <p>As can be seen from the image below, the volume for Aave on Ethereum decreased rapidly. Additionally, large addresses also lost interest in Aave. This was indicated by the declining top addresses holding AAVE on the network.</p>
      <p>Aave’s network growth decreased as well, thus, signifying that the number of new users transferring <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/aave-seeks-community-go-ahead-to-list-lidos-wsteth-on-its-liquidity-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the coin</a> for the first time on Ethereum’s network shrank.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether the growth of <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/despite-growth-aave-could-still-face-these-hurdles-in-q4-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aave</a> on the Arbitrum network points to a larger shift to L2 networks.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/aave-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AAVE</a> was trading at $61.52, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

      <p>Auditing firm <a href="https://www.mazars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mazars</a> has released 
      a <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/Binance_POR_Report_7_December_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">report</a> about Binance’s BTC reserves. The auditing firm has reached the same conclusion as Binance itself. As of November 
      22 at 23:59 UTC, Binance held enough bitcoins and wrapped bitcoins to cover all users’s balances on the exchange.</p>
      <p>Binance had already launched a proof-of-reserves website nearly two weeks ago to reassure its users following 
        the collapse of FTX. Today’s audit just confirms that Binance doesn’t appear to be lying, according to Mazars</p>
      <p>As always, there are some limitations with these proof-of-reserves exercises. The biggest caveat is that Binance 
          is only focusing on BTC assets for now. If you hold other cryptocurrencies, there is no proof-of-reserves system 
          just yet.</p>
      <p>While bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency, Binance offers hundreds of different crypto assets. So let’s 
        hope this is just a first step.</p>
      <p>Similarly, both Binance and Mazars looked at the BTC reserves on November 22 at 23:59 UTC. While it’s hard to provide 
        an instant snapshot, Binance hasn’t committed to a timeline for its proof-of-reserves reports. For instance, the crypto 
        exchange could share data every week or every month.</p>
      <p>Now that you are aware of all that, let’s talk about what’s in Binance’s proof-of-reserves system and the Mazars 
        auditing report. Binance uses a Merkle tree to include all individual user accounts and generate a cryptographic seal. 
        This Merkle tree covers user balances across several Binance products — Spot, Funding, Margin, Futures, Earn and Options 
        Wallet.</p>
      <p>Binance also listed all the wallets that hold customer assets. Blockchain explorers let you obtain the balance of 
        crypto wallets just by looking at the public addresses of those wallets.</p>
      <p>Binance found that its users collectively held 575,742.4228 BTC ($9.7 billion at today’s exchange rate) and that it 
        has enough BTC and wrapped BTC to cover 101% of these funds. It then contacted Mazars so the auditing firm could 
        independently verify what the crypto exchange was saying.</p>
      <p>Mazars asked Binance to perform tiny transactions at a specific time to show that the wallets were indeed under 
        the control of Binance. For some wallets, it used a different method. In that case, Mazars used Etherscan and BSCscan 
        to check that the ETH and BSC wallets belong to Binance.</p>
      <p>The auditing firm checked the scripts that Binance is using to extract the total value in user accounts. Mazars 
        checked that there wasn’t any duplication of user IDs and constructed its own Merkle tree using this open source 
        script developed by SilverSixpence.</p>
      <p>Some users have a negative BTC balance because they have been using the margin and loan service with other crypto 
        assets as collateral. “Binance’s margin and loan products are always over-collateralized and subject to additional 
        risk controls (such as auto liquidation). These products ONLY utilize funds from customers actively using Binance 
        Earn products such as savings whose terms permit this,” Binance said as a comment in the auditing report.</p>
      <p>If you take everything into account, Mazars and Binance reach the same conclusion when it comes to BTC reserves. 
        This is a good step when it comes to transparency. Now, let’s hope there will be more announcements in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released a new report on Wednesday from global 
        financial audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showing that Binance's customer bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BTC</a>) reserves are 
        overcollateralized.</p>
      <p>"At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total 
        platform liabilities," Mazars said <a href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">in an announcement</a>. 
        The exact percentage was 101%.</p>
      <p>The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX because of liquidity issues has rivals rushing to improve the 
        transparency of their financial reserves. The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin 
        is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.</p>
      <p>However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting 
        at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "They did a comparison of balances per public key address 
        from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or 
        depositories," said McKenna.</p>
      <p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report," she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based 
        accounting firm that provided <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/26/tethers-former-auditor-fined-1m-by-sec-for-sloppy-accounting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017</a> was accused of “serial 
        violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
        Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/18/tether-swaps-accounting-firms-says-it-will-publish-monthly-attestation-on-stablecoin-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports</a> in August.</p>
      <p>Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis. 
        Assets included were customers’ spot, options, margin, futures, funding, loan and earn accounts for BTC and wrapped 
        bitcoin held on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.</p>

      <p>With the recent events in the crypto space, investors seem to be putting more faith in DEXes</p>
      <p>DEXes has seen recently seen an increase in trading volume and TVL in recent time</p>
      <p>Investors have started viewing <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/chainalysis-report-reveals-this-about-centralized-vs-decentralized-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">centralized exchanges</a> (CEXes) with skepticism as fear and uncertainty have engulfed the cryptocurrency market. However, despite the current state of CEXes, their decentralized equivalent seems to be thriving. According to data by Messari, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have recently experienced a significant spike in volume. But how significant have these spikes been?</p>
      <h3>DEXes trade volume surge</h3>
      <p>Messari’s statistics revealed that the top three DEXes, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/uniswap-is-changing-tactics-to-pursue-more-growth-beyond-l1-l2-heres-how/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Uniswap</a>, Balancer, and <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/sushiswap-investors-going-long-can-expect-this-in-the-coming-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Sushiswap</a> had a combined transaction volume of nearly $7 billion over the previous 30 days. However, a closer look at each one showed how much growth had occurred.</p>
      <p>In terms of transaction volume and TVL, <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/uniswap-user-and-dev-activity-lack-of-profitability-and-everything-in-between/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Uniswap</a> was ranked first among all DEXes. The trading volume for Uniswap revealed that there had been noticeable rises in recent weeks. This demonstrates the platform’s increased trading activity.</p>
      <p>The trading volume for the DEX reached approximately $300 million, which was a record for the year so far, according to the trade volume chart.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-pink.png" alt="Dex sees inceases in trading volume"/>
      <p>It had experienced $3.57 billion in trade volume over the previous 30 days, a rise of 65.32%. Although the TVL showed a modest dip, it still had $2.6 billion, at the time of writing.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-down.png" alt="Dex sees inceases in trading volume"/>
      <p>In the previous 30 days, its revenue had likewise climbed by over 64%.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a glance at Balancer revealed that the DEX experienced a sharp increase in trade volume. Trading volume reached its all-time high during this time, rising by a staggering 730.38% in the past 30 days to reach $2.09 billion</p>
