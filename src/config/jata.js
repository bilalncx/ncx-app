    	<p>Dow Jones futures rose slightly early Friday after the March jobs report showed slowing hiring and wage growth but also declining unemployment. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) cut U.S. prices on all its electric vehicles. U.S. markets are closed today.</p>
	    <p>The major indexes held up well in a holiday-shortened trading week, with midweek pullbacks looking healthy and normal. But many sectors and leading stocks sold off hard, including Tesla stock</p>	
	    <p>Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) broke out Thursday. China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) flashed an aggressive entry.</p>	
	    <p>Google stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders, along with Microsoft (MSFT).</p>
      <p>The video embedded in the article discussed the weekly market action and analyzed Google, BABA stock and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).</p>
      <h3>Jobs Report</h3>
      <p>The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000, just below estimates for 240,000. That's down from February's revised 326,000.</p>
      <p>Private payrolls rose just 189,000. well below views for 223,000. Manufacturing jobs unexpectedly dipped 1,000.</p>
      <p>The jobless rate unexpectedly dipped to 3.5%, back to long-term lows. However, the labor force participation rate climbed to a post-Covid high of 62.6%.</p>
      <p>Hourly earnings rose 0.3% vs. February, in line. The annual gain cooled to 4.2%, below views for 4.3% and the lowest in years.</p>
      <p>The average workweek unexpectedly shortened, to 34.4 hours.</p>
      <p>Despite the slower wage gains and private hiring, the odds of a Fed rate hike in May rose to 65% Thursday morning from 49% on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Futures Today</h3>
      <p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value, reversing from slim losses before the jobs report. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures edged higher.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield popped 7 basis points to 3.36%.</p>
      <p>Stock futures stop trading at 9:15 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>U.S. stock markets are closed in observance of Good Friday.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong and European markets are closed for Good Friday and Easter Monday.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally had a mixed week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% in  weekly stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1%. The Nasdaq fell 1.1% and the Russell 2000 slumped 2.5%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices leapt 6.65% to $80.92 a barrel, mostly on Monday after the surprise OPEC+ output cut. Crude futures have surged 20.9% in three weeks.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled 22 basis points to 3.28%, hitting seven-month lows.</p>
      <h3>Growth ETFs</h3>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 3.5% for the week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 1.6%. Microsoft stock is a major IGV holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gave up 4.1%.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) skidded 4.4% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) dropped 1.2%, though both rose Thursday. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Price Cuts</h3>
      <p>Tesla cut U.S. prices on all its EVs overnight. It reduced Model S and X prices for the third time this year, both by $5,000 in this instance. The Model S starts at $84,990 while the Model X now begins at $94,990.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tesla trimmed U.S. Model 3 prices by $1,000 to an entry price of $41,990. The Model Y was cut $2,000 to $49,990.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, Tesla cut Model 3 and Y prices in Australia once again.</p>
      <p>Tesla slashed global prices in January, with further U.S. cuts on its S and X vehicles and additional European discounts in March. That, along with new U.S. EV credits, pushed first-quarter Tesla deliveries to a new record. But they fell short of FactSet views. Production exceeded deliveries once again, with Model S and X output nearly twice as high as sales.</p>
      <p>Many analysts predicted further Tesla price cuts to support demand, further cutting its prized margins</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Investors won't get a chance to react to the latest Tesla price cut until Monday. But Tesla stock tumbled 10.8% to 185.06 this week following the Q1 delivery report. Shares plunged below a 200.76 cup-with-handle buy point and the 50-day moving average.</p>
      <p>The base had formed below the 200-day line, which is not great. The 200.76 buy point is no longer valid, but TSLA stock is working on a new handle, already present on a weekly chart, with a 207.89 entry. Of course, the 200-day line still looms just above that.</p>
      <p>Tesla earnings for the first quarter are due April 19, when investors will see how price cuts have hit profit margins so far.</p>
      <h3>Google Stock</h3>
      <p>Google jumped 3.8% on Thursday to 108.42 in above-normal volume. Shares rallied past a cup-with-handle buy point of 106.69 according to MarketSmith analysis.</p>
      <p>Google's CEO said the company will add a chat AI to its search engine soon, after Microsoft (MSFT) added ChatGPT to its Bing search engine and other products.</p>
      <h3>Alibaba Stock</h3>
      <p>Alibaba stock popped 4.25% on Thursday to 102.74, breaking the downtrend of a handle, offering an early entry. The new handle is above the 50-day line but fractionally too low in the base to be considered proper.</p>
      <p>BABA stock surged in the prior week after Alibaba said it would split into six different units with their own CEOs and the option of filing for IPOs.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Rally Analysis</h3>
      <p>The stock market rally had a normal and healthy pullback on the major indexes during the week.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq fell, but recovered the 12,000 level Thursday. The S&P 500 edged lower while the Dow Jones moved higher.</p>
      <p>Google stock had a solid week and Meta Platforms (META) kept rising. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft stock were little changed, at the edge of buy zones. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH) had big weekly gains.</p>
      <p>But there were a lot of big losers. Construction and industrial-related groups tumbled Tuesday while growth stocks sold off Wednesday. Many suffered significant damage, while others could move back into position relatively soon. Thursday's rebounds, often from key levels, were definitely encouraging.</p>
      <p>Defensive growth and defensive names had a strong week, including medicals, consumer staples and utilities.</p>
      <p>Will those areas continue to do well if a "risk-on" mentality returns?</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>The existential threat to Saudi Arabia and the OPEC cartel comes from China, not from net zero or from green deals in the West.</p>
    	<p>Chinese sales of petrol and diesel cars fell 20pc in absolute volume terms in February from a year earlier. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles kept rising explosively and reached a record 32pc of the market for standard passenger cars.</p>	
    	<p>At the current pace, EV sales in China will hit eight million this year, helped by the proliferation of battery-swapping stations. Rather than charging your own car, you do an instant swap. No need to wait. No need for charge-points everywhere.</p>	
    	<p>Sales have surged despite the elimination of subsidies at the end of last year.  China’s best-selling EV is the BYD Song Plus, which retails for about £22,000. Number two is the smaller Wuling Mini. It starts at around £4,000 (not a misprint).</p>
      <p>“They are producing cheap EVs for the mass market, which is still completely lacking in the West. It is absolutely taking off,” said Lord Adair Turner, chairman of the global Energy Transitions Commission (ETC).</p>
      <p>The consensus forecast until recently was that EV penetration would reach 40pc of Chinese sales by 2030. That threshold could be crossed as soon as this year if manufacturers can produce fast enough to meet the demand. “We think EVs will reach 80pc of sales in China by 2030,” said Kingsmill Bond from energy strategists RMI.</p>
      <p>Electrification is spreading to light commercial vehicles, up 85pc year-on-year.  Over 60pc of buses in service in Chinese cities are already low-carbon. All municipal buses on the eastern seaboard will be electrified by 2025. Long-haul trucks are next in line.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that EVs worldwide have already displaced 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) of oil use, or 1.5pc of global demand. This is about to accelerate exponentially.</p>
      <p>“China’s demand for oil is suddenly going to start falling. Half of China's total car fleet could be electric by 2030. If you add up the numbers, that could subtract several million barrels of oil a day,” said Lord Turner.</p>
      <p>“China’s high speed rail network means that there won’t be so much internal aviation either. Oil use per capita is never going to be anything close to American levels,” he said.</p>
      <p>Opec maintains the fiction that oil demand will keep booming until the middle of the century, but this is based on the obsolete premise that Asia's rising middle class will more than compensate for declining imports in Europe and America.</p>
      <p>“Whatever they say in public, the Saudis know the game is up. They can see that the world’s largest car market for petrol cars is going to collapse,” said RMI’s Mr Bond.</p>
      <p>For the last 40 years the Saudis have acted (mostly) as ‘Federal Reserve’ of the global oil market, working closely with the US and Europe to maintain stability. They would restrain Opec hotheads from pushing prices too high at critical moments, knowing that this would backfire by accelerating the switch to rival technologies.</p>
      <p>It has abandoned this role as market regulator under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The strategy today is to extract as much money as possible from crude reserves before the window shuts forever, deliberately forcing prices higher (by cartel practices) to exploit captive demand for legacy transport.</p>
      <p>Last weekend’s Saudi-led decision by Opec and Russia to cut global supply by a further 1.1m b/d is an act of weakness. It is not the action of states seeking to preserve a sustainable business model.</p>
      <p>It was an affront to President Joe Biden but it was no favour for Xi Jinping either. Oil shocks are horrible for China. Its energy intensity per unit of GDP is two and a half times higher than in the US.</p>
      <p>America is largely self-sufficient in crude: China is the world’s largest importer by far at 10.8m b/d. Its oil-import dependency has risen to 70pc, a greater level of vulnerability than the US at the worst point of the Arab oil embargo in 1973.</p>
      <p>This oil is mostly shipped in tankers through the Straits of Molucca. China is also the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, which also comes on ships. This is a glaring geostrategic weakness as the superpower clash with the US turns increasingly dangerous.</p>
      <p>Chinese strategists can see how the West is using its stranglehold over global tanker fleets, vessel insurance, and shipping finance to asphyxiate Russia. They have also studied Franklin Roosevelt’s blockade of Japanese oil imports in 1941. They know that China cannot risk a showdown over Taiwan until it has a safer supply of energy.</p>
      <p>Hence the massive expansion of renewable power currently underway. Great tracts of desert in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang are being covered with solar panels and onshore turbines, bundled with extra coal capacity as a back-up to avoid winter blackouts.</p>
      <p>Xi Jinping’s original plan was to reach 1,200 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar by 2030. China’s Research Academy of Environmental Sciences says this target will be achieved five years early, given that the rollout is running at 180 GW a year.</p>
      <p>This compares to total installed capacity of 33 GW in France, 42 GW in the UK, and 240 GW in the US since the start of the green era.</p>
      <p>Nikhil Bhandari and Amber Cai from Goldman Sachs think China will smash the target three times over, reaching a staggering 3,300 GW by the end of this decade, all backed by a vast expansion of energy storage. They estimate that the county could halve its total energy imports by the early 2040s.</p>
      <p>This would require $2.2 trillion of investments but that should not be understood as a cost. Goldman says combined renewables with storage operating around the clock will be highly profitable by 2030 as they undercut coal, with a rate of return on capital reaching 10pc.</p>
      <p>They think China’s total CO2 emissions will peak as soon as 2028.</p>
      <p>China is not doing this as a favour to the West. It is doing so in order to confront the West from a position of greater strength in the future, and because it aims to become the world’s clean-tech hegemon.</p>
      <p>The Chinese have already cornered 90pc of global production of solar panels, and control 70pc of the lithium output – although that may matter less as sodium-ion batteries arrive.</p>
      <p>One can be too cynical about China’s motives. Xi Jinping was an environmental crusader 20 years ago as Zhejiang party chief.  He was a pioneer of the radical ‘Green GDP’ campaign in 2004, which called on local governments to subtract ecological damage from the raw GDP figures. He knows that China is more immediately vulnerable to climate change than the US or Europe.</p>
      <p>Chinese scientists say the Himalayan glaciers – the Third Pole – are melting even faster than previously thought. They will shrink by two-thirds over the course of this century under current warming trends, exposing China’s ancient river systems to the annual devastation of spring floods followed by summer droughts. So yes, China has to act.</p>
      <p>China’s green leap forward is a nightmare for Big Oil. It is compelling America and Europe to respond in kind, causing a step-change in the arms race for clean-tech ascendancy.</p>
      <p>The EU’s retreat from its 2035 ban on combustion engines makes no difference in this larger geo-economic context. The permitted e-fuels, made from green hydrogen, are too wasteful and expensive to have any commercial relevance. They retain just 16pc of the original energy input compared to 77pc for EVs.</p>
      <p>The next generation of solid state batteries and lithium-air variants will complete the annihilation in the late 2020s, opening the way to EVs with much longer driving ranges, much lower costs, and less reliance on scarce minerals.</p>
      <p>Technology married to market forces will render fossil-fuel bans in the EU, the UK, Japan, California, or Quebec superfluous before they come into force.</p>
      <p>Personally, I had assumed that oil would enjoy one last hurrah in the early 2020s as a decade of under-investment drives prices to $150 or $200. But this does not seem so inevitable any more. The rallies keep fading.</p>
      <p>The events of the last week suggest that the process of oil displacement is more advanced than we had assumed. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the petrostates have already entered the first stage of terminal run-off.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin moved in a narrow range above the support line at US$28,000 in Friday morning trading in Asia, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies declined. Ether lost ground as the U.S. Treasury said the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) posed a security risk. U.S. equities closed higher Thursday despite signs of a slowing labor market and a grim global economic outlook report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
    	<p>Fast facts</p>	
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin dipped 0.49% to US$28,041 in the 24 hours to 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, edging up 0.04% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token moved back into positive territory later in the morning and moved in a tight range.</li>
        <li>Ether dipped 1.90% to US$1,873, following the U.S. Treasury Department’s statement on Thursday describing DeFi services as a threat to national security. Ethereum is a primary blockchain platform that allows development of decentralized applications in DeFi, where its Ether token is used as the primary means of exchange.</li>
        <li>Ether, however, is up 4.4% on the week as the blockchain awaits next Wednesday’s Shanghai hardfork, also known as Shapella upgrade, which will allow investors to withdraw their staked Ether for the first time.</li>
        <li>Dogecoin fell 8% to US$0.08542 after Elon Musk switched the Twitter icon back to the traditional blue bird after replacing it with the Dogecoin dog image earlier this week. Still, the meme token is still up 15% on the week.</li>
        <li>Other tokens followed a similar price pattern, down for Friday but holding gains over seven days. Cardano’s ADA token dipped 2.32% to US$0.3834, but is up 1.85% week-to-date. Polygon’s Matic fell 2.27%, yet is up about 2% higher over the seven days.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.84% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion. Total trading volume in the same period lost 15.64% to US$37.11 billion.</li>
        <li>In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.53% to 3,987.19 in the 24 hours to 08:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 0.65% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast Labs data branch, CryptoSlam.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed little changed to higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished flat, the S&P 500 gained 0.36%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.76%.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Labor Department on Thursday said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 228,000 in the week ended April 1, but annual revisions to the number showed applications were higher this year than expected, indicating a slowing labor market. This added to concern the U.S. economy may be headed for a recession after a raft of interest rate hikes to curb inflation.</li>
        <li>This view gained some credence from IMF’s managing director Kristalina Georgieva predicting just 3% growth in the global economy for the next five years, the lowest forecast in two decades.</li>
        <li>U.S. interest rates are now between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Ahead of the Federal Reserve rates meeting on May 3, analysts at the CME Group expect a 44.5% chance of a 25 basis-point rise, while 55.5% expect no change, up from 54.2% on Thursday.</li>
        <li>U.S. stock futures traded lower as of 8:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.12%, S&P 500 futures moved down 0.097% and the Nasdaq-100 futures Index dropped 0.11%. U.S. equity markets are closed Friday in observance of Good Friday.</li>
        <li>(Updates Dogecoin section with icon switch back to blue bird at Twitter.)</li>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Path Trading Partners Co-Founder and Chief Market Strategist Bob Iaccino joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the rise of gold prices, the catalyst, and how inflation plays a part.</p>
    	<p>SEANA SMITH: You're looking at gold off a little bit today, pulling back from a 13-month high on weaker economic data. Still, though, obviously, above 2,000. Gold since the start of the year up just about 10%, hovering above that critical $2,000 level here, and just trading just about 50 bucks below its record high. We want to bring in Bob Iaccino. He's Path Trading Partners co-founder and chief market strategist. Bob, it's good to see you here. So we're holding above that 2,000 level. I think a lot of investors are asking if there's really upside here to the price of gold. What do you think?</p>	
    	<p>BOB IACCINO: I think there is. Gold was my big call for the year. I'm sticking with that as of this point. I still think we're going into recession, although the timeline may be pushed a little bit. The yield curve says we're already there. Economic data is going to start to slow. And if you're long gold, which I am, the best case scenario is the Fed cuts rates to get you into-- or I'm sorry, out of a recession, which is positive for gold.</p>	
    	<p>Worst case scenario, the Fed continues to raise rates. I think this is the least likely. And they hold-- or they hold the pause a little bit longer. Two out of three of these cases is good for gold. The worst case scenario is that they hold the pause, and we actually get this soft landing or easy landing or even no landing. That wouldn't be great for gold, and I think that's the least likely scenario.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Fed certainly plays a role. Bob, talk about some of the other factors driving the prices where they are today.</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, again, you have this issue of asset prices being sold off. And gold has always taken advantage of that. And what's generally happened is, the Fed-- again, bringing that out-- cuts rates to help the economy and help asset prices. That's been a driver of gold in the past. And a lot of people believed that. CME Fed watch tool has cuts starting in July of this year, which the Fed says they're not going to do.</p>
      <p>Another one is people think of gold as an inflation hedge. And it's really not. What gold is, is it's an asset. And if you look at assets in general, when inflation starts and then continues to rise through, gold powers through that because it's an asset, just like house prices, just like stocks. We forget the good part about inflation is asset inflation, and gold is an asset. The problem comes in for gold investors when the Fed starts to aggressively fight inflation.</p>
      <p>So something we haven't had, which has contributed to gold's underperformance over the last decade or so, was we haven't had inflation, so we haven't had a Fed to fight inflation. And that's kind of gave gold this weakness. When inflation started, gold rallied. We saw that March spike that references almost the all-time high that Seana mentioned. We're driving toward that again. And if we are in a situation where, as Neil Dutta from Renaissance or at Macro put it, inflation remains unaddressed, then gold's going to benefit from that.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Bob, how much upside is there to gold? Are we talking 2,500? Are we talking above that?</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, here's where people think I'm nuts. I think we can easily break to new highs. And I think if it goes the way I think it's going to go, easily within the next 12 months, we could see 2,800. I used to say by the end of the year. I'm not saying that anymore because I think the Fed was much more aggressive than I thought they would be when I made that call.</p>
      <p>But I think the issue here is the popular opinion and the politically popular opinion is that the Fed should stop trying to fight inflation. And I don't think people realize how bad that is for the whole country, as opposed to just 2 or 3 million people. And I don't mean to downplay that. I want to stress that.</p>
      <p>But the 2 or 3 million people that may lose their jobs in a recession, a recession, as investors should look at it, is good for gold. I'm sorry, it's good for stocks. It's not necessarily good for gold. Where gold outperforms is when there's inflation and a recession. And I think that's what we're going to because I think the Fed is going to cave in to pressure and stop fighting inflation.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: 2,800 call-- gutsy. All right, Bob, with that, we want to play a little game. We want to see how deep your love for gold goes. We're calling this Bob's Buys. We'll give you a choice between two investments. You'll tell us which is the buy and why. First up, Bitcoin, which has been surging with gold, which seems a little odd on its face. So Bitcoin or gold?</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: So I have to ask you a question first, and we actually did this with a recent guest on our podcast. Is this 100% in one or the other?</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Is it 100%? I'm not sure.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: You mean all in on gold or all in on Bitcoin?</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: Yeah, can I go 70/30, or I can't do that?</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I see what you're saying.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Yeah, sure, you can make your own twist to the game. We're open to suggestions, Bob.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Well, look at you making up your own rules. I was going to say 100%, but go, go.</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: Well, actually, if you make me pick 100, it's gold. I am actually in about 70% gold, 30% Bitcoin for that amount of the capital that we allocate to this sort of space because I think the issue with Bitcoin is, is it here in 10 years or not? I think it is, but I don't run that sort of part of the game, so.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, Bob, well, we're setting you up here because we have a couple to get through. So the next one's up is treasuries, TIPS, or gold? What do you think?</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: Gold.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: You're sticking with it. Didn't even have to think twice about it.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: I want to get back to the prior answer. What do you make of the dynamic, though? Gold rising typically tells us people are risk averse. How does that rise with arguably the most speculative asset on the planet in Bitcoin? How do those rise together?</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: So Bitcoin has a couple of things going for it. It's, again, beginning to perform in a non-correlated way, which I like. It hadn't done that. It was correlated very sharply to the NASDAQ. That's not the case anymore, at least in the short-term. If that sticks with it, then a non-correlated asset is always good in any environment. So that's really the core of it.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, Bob, and last up here, I bonds or gold? What do you think?</p>
      <p>BOB IACCINO: Wow, that one's tough. I'm going to have to say gold, too. But I think if you put me in a position, I'd go 60% gold, 40% I bonds.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: All right, there we go. All right, gold the winner of all three. You're the gold guy, so maybe we shouldn't be surprised by that. Bob, great to see you. Thanks so much.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>April 6 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes ended higher on Thursday, helped by a rally in Alphabet shares as investors, worried about a slowing economy, looked to upcoming jobs data.</p>
    	<p>Alphabet Inc rallied 3.8% and Microsoft climbed 2.6%, with both providing more fuel than any other stocks for the S&P 500's gain for the session. Alphabet's Google unit plans to add artificial intelligence features to its search engine, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>	
    	<p>Adding to recent data hinting at a weak labor market, initial jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ended April 1, versus expectations of 200,000 claims.</p>	
    	<p>The Labor Department's data from the prior week was revised to show 48,000 more applications were received.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 climbed 0.36% to end the session at 4,105.02 points.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq gained 0.76% to 12,087.96 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 33,485.29 points.</p>
      <p>Wall Street has lost ground in recent days in response to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings earlier this week.</p>
      <p>That marked a change from recent months, when investors cheered weak economic data on the basis that it might mean the Fed's interest rate hikes were working and that the Fed could ease up on its campaign to rein in decades-high inflation.</p>
      <p>Interest rate futures imply traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise its target rate or keep it steady at its upcoming May meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.</p>
      <p>"The market is trying to decide whether the 'growth and recession' scare or the 'Fed hiking' scare are more meaningful to prices, and so it's waffling between whether a softening labor market is good news because it gets the Fed to pause in May or bad news because it means the recession is actually coming," said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
      <p>Investors are now focused on the more comprehensive report on non-farm payrolls, which are expected to have increased by 239,000 in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month. That report is due on Friday, when the U.S. stock market will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.</p>
      <p>Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight rose, led by communication services, up 1.71%, followed by a 0.74% gain in utilities.</p>
      <p>With some investors away during a shortened holiday week, volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 9 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 12.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.</p>
      <p>For the week, the S&P 500 declined 0.1%, the Dow added 0.6% and the Nasdaq lost 1.1%.</p>
      <p>In Thursday's trading, Caterpillar, viewed as a bellwether for the industrial sector, dipped 2%, bringing its loss over the past three days to 9% as investors fretted about a potential economic downturn.</p>
      <p>AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc surged 21% after a U.S. court denied the theater operator's request to lift a status quo order necessary for its plan to convert preferred shares to common shares.</p>
      <p>Levi Strauss & Co tumbled 16% after the apparel maker posted a fall in quarterly profit.</p>
      <p>Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup will be among companies kicking off the quarterly reporting season next week, with investors eager for updates on the health of the sector after a recent banking crisis.</p>
      <p>Analysts on average expect aggregate S&P 500 company earnings for the first quarter to have fallen 5% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.2-to-one ratio.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 posted six new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 177 new lows.</p>

      <h3>In this article:</h3>
      <p>U.S. stocks marched upward Thursday, with tech stocks leading the Nasdaq higher than other indexes, after fresh data pointed to a gradual softening of labor market conditions ahead of the highly anticipated Friday jobs report.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered just above the flatline. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.8%.</p>	
      <p>The stock and bond markets will both close for Good Friday on April 7.</p>	
      <p>Government bond yields were higher. The yield on the 10-year note was up slightly, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields climbed to 3.82% Thursday.</p>
      <p>On the commodities front, gold futures (GC=F) are shining right now after the metal managed to break the $2,000-per-ounce barrier on the back of weak U.S. economic data, as well as hopes that the Fed will raise rates more slowly.</p>
      <p>Crude oil (CL=F) continues to hover around $80 a barrel, little changed after big gains to start the week. At the same time, gas prices nationwide have notched up to a five-month high, surpassing $3.50 per gallon, according to data from AAA. The jump comes as the OPEC+ coalition, in a surprise decision last weekend, decided to cut oil production.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose by 228,000 for the week ended April 1, the Labor Department data reported, higher than consensus estimates of 200,000. The prior week was revised up to 246,000 given the government's updated seasonal factors. Continuing claims were also revised up for the week ending March 18 from 1.689 million to 1.823 million.</p>
      <p>This comes after a report Wednesday from the private payroll firm ADP showed that employers added 145,000 jobs in March as the labor market showed signs of slowing from its strong pace so far this year.</p>
      <p>That figure was well below the consensus estimates of 210,000 and lower than the revised 261,000 jobs gained in February. But market strategists say it's unclear if ADP’s results foreshadow a softer nonfarm payrolls report Friday, where Wall Street's attention now turns.</p>
      <p>Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Friday's jobs report to show 240,000 jobs created last month. This would be significantly lower than the average job gains of 343,000 over the last six months.</p>
      <p>In additional jobs data earlier this week, the government's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) found that openings receded more than expected to 9.931 million, marking the first time the number dropped below 10 million since May 2021.</p>
      <p>The gradual slowing in the labor market may be encouraging for policymakers. Some investors are maintaining “a fairly dovish path” from the Fed over the coming months.</p>
      <p>“For instance, at the next meeting in May, the chances of a rate hike according to futures remained at 47%, after having been as high as 70% earlier in the week,” Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday she predicts rates will need to move higher.</p>
      <p>"Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down," Mester said in a speech at the Money Marketeers of New York University.</p>
      <p>Markets on Thursday seemed to welcome the comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who cooled fears that the recent bank failures will send the economy into a recession.</p>
      <p>Separately, the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday that the global economy will grow less 3% this year, the lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990.</p>
      <p>In single-stock moves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) shares slid after the retailer reported softer-than-expected March sales amid a slowdown in discretionary spending from consumers.</li>
        <li>Shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) moved upward after the company expanded its cloud computing partnership with Microsoft to government agencies.</li>
        <li>CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose Thursday following an investor day on Tuesday during which hinted at coming up short on medium-term growth and profit outlook.</li>
        <li>Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) surged after Delaware's Court of Chancery ruled against a share conversion settlement.</li>
        <li>Constellation Brands (STZ) shares gained after the company reported results that beat analyst expectations and increased its quarterly dividend.</li>
        <li>Shares of Levi's (LEVI) plunged 16% after the retailer reported a drop in quarterly profit. The company maintained full-year guidance.</li>
        <li>Airbnb (ABNB) shares were on the downswing Thursday after a publication reported that top professional hosts are building out their own booking platforms and offering discounts to cut out Airbnb.</li>
        <li>Shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and (GOOGL) rose as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai remains bullish that Google's search engine can hold its ground against a ChatGPT-led AI onslaught. The company giant plans to add chat functionality to Google Search, according to the Wall Street Journal.</li>
        <li>Elsewhere on the earnings front, WD-40 (WDFC), Lamb Weston (LW), and RPM (RPM) are also set to report on Thursday.</li>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Wednesday amid uncertainty over the outlook for the world economy as reports on job openings and factory orders in the US heightened recession fears.</p>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.45% to 7,668 points during midday trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was flat at 7,339 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) slipped 0.21% to 15,571.</p>	
	    <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the red ahead of the opening bell.</p>	
	    <p>Wall Street sank and oil prices held steady Tuesday as new data showed fresh signs of labour market cooling and declining factory orders from businesses.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.59% to close at 33,402 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.58% to finish at 4,100 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) slipped 0.52% to 12,126.</p>
      <p>On the economic front, vacancies at US employers fell to 9.93 million from 10.5 million, a bigger fall than expected. On the other hand, quits were up and layoffs were down, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Separately, factory orders fell 0.3%, also lower than anticipated.</p>
      <p>Some economists view the slowdown in the number of open job positions as "progress" to reaching the Fed's goal of an equilibrium between supply and demand in the labour market.</p>
      <p>"While the Fed will welcome the softening in the data, officials will put much more stock in Friday's employment report and will continue to raise rates at the coming meetings to ensure further progress is made toward softer labour market conditions and lower inflation," Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.68% to 27,813 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong tumbled 0.66% to 20,274. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) gained ground, rising 0.49% to 3,312 points.</p>
      <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
      <p>Back in London, the FTSE was being aided the banking sector after Barclays (BARC.L) rose 1.79% and Lloyds (LLOY.L) lifted 1.20%.</p>
      <p>The index was led by the United Utilities Group (UU.L), up 2.98%.</p>
      <p>Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: "Markets are drifting as investor thoughts start to turn towards the scale of severity, as the likelihood of a recession later in the year in the US increases.</p>
      <p>"Further evidence of a slowing economy came in the form of releases showing factory orders which dropped for a second month and, in particular, as job openings fell to the lowest level in almost two years. The resilience of the labour market to date has kept the Federal Reserve on high alert in its battle against inflation, and most recent data has tended to suggest that the interest rate hiking policy is now taking a measured effect on crimping growth."</p>
      <p>Hunter added that as traders begin to rein in any new positions ahead of the long Easter weekend, markets were finding little reason to make any progress.</p>
      <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) was down against the dollar, trading around $1.24, after rallying the previous session. Investors are waiting on the latest UK PMI data, which can have a knock down effect on the sterling.</p>
      <p>The same against the euro, with sterling (GBPEUR=X) hovering around €1.14.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) stopped its climb was trading at around $85/barrel, after rebounding demand in the US after data revealed that US crude stockpiles decreased by more than anticipated.</p>
      <p>Supply side concerns are also pushing prices higher, driven by the recent output cut decision by OPEC and other oil-producing countries.</p>

      <p>In this article:</p>
    	<p>Ethereum has gained 8% in the past 24 hours as it edges closer to the $2,000 (£1,602) mark ahead of the blockchain's Shanghai upgrade.</p>
    	<p>Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, reached a high of $1,920 in the last 24 hours, a price level not seen since August 2022.</p>	
    	<p>The upward trajectory comes despite uncertain macroeconomic conditions caused by successive US Federal Reserve rate hikes, and turmoil in the global banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB).</p>
      <h3>What is Ethereum's Shanghai Upgrade?</h3>	
    	<p>The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will mark Ethereum's complete transition to a proof-of-stake network, further solidifying its position within the cryptocurrency landscape as the most widely adopted layer one blockchain.</p>
      <p>Scheduled for April 12, the Shanghai upgrade, commonly known as 'Shapella', will signify the blockchain's complete shift from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) network. Proof of stake blockchains use over 99% less energy to validate than those that operate using proof of stake.</p>
      <p>This transition follows the previous 'merge' upgrade in September, and for the first time, it will allow users to withdraw their staked ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>By moving to a proof of stake network, Ethereum will reduce its energy consumption by 99.9%, and enable users to generate passive income through staking their cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Staking involves earning financial rewards for contributing to the blockchain's network and supporting its functionality.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Upgrade will allow those ether 'stakers' who lock their funds to make the network function, to withdraw their staked ETH.</p>
      <p>This is a relief to many stakers who experienced anxiety throughout the last quarter of 2022 when the price of the cryptocurrency was sent into a downward spiral after the collapse of the FTX exchange.</p>
      <h3>Today's crypto prices</h3>
      <p>The global cryptocurrency market cap today stands at $1.25tn (£860bn), a gain of 2.5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
      <p>Ethereum stands at $1,911 as of the time of writing, a gain of 8% in the past week.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is now priced at $28,531, up 5% in the past week.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin has gained 70% since beginning of the year, and according to data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours most traders of the digital asset hold long positions, suggesting market sentiment is currently in favour of more upward momentum.</p>
      <p>Coinglass data showed that in the past 24 hours, across the entire cryptocurrency market, 30,188 traders were liquidated, with the total liquidations comes in at $97.95m. The majority of these liquidations were of short positions as the whole market gained in value.</p>
      <p>However, one of the most prominent losers in the past 24 hours was dogecoin (DOGE-USD).</p>
      <p>The price of dogecoin shot up yesterday after Twitter changed the logo on the social media platform's website from the iconic blue bird to an image of a Shiba Inu dog associated with the dogecoin cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>The price of dogecoin, which is typically volatile, soared 35% in one day, however, it fell as day traders dumped the memecoin to take gains.</p>
      <p>Dogecoin now sits at $0.096 per token, a fall of 2.2% in the past 24 hours, according to data from Coingecko.</p>

	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- For months, the Middle Eastern oil market has been among the tightest in the world as regional exporters support Asia’s recovering demand. This week, OPEC+’s surprise output cuts made it even stronger.</p>
	    <p>Key markers in the Dubai crude market — the benchmark for Middle Eastern grades — leapt higher after the Saudi-led decision. The most active timespread for Dubai swaps jumped to above $1 a barrel in backwardation, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd, outperforming the Brent curve.</p>	
	    <p>While OPEC+’s production cuts will take effect only next month, Dubai’s strength reflects expectations that the reductions will strengthen an already-robust market for Middle Eastern supplies. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE and Kuwait pledged to cut a combined 980,000 barrels a day of output, with generally heavier and more sulfurous crude as the bulk of their production.</p>	
	    <p>That’s likely to lift the relative value of Dubai crude — which is both a proxy for Middle Eastern oil markets as well as medium-sour oil varieties — against global benchmarks such as Brent even further, a shot in arm for long-haul cargo flows from the Atlantic Basin and Americas into Asia.</p>
      <p>Even prior to the OPEC+ cuts, traders were already bullish on Dubai versus other crudes, as red-hot Chinese demand hoovers up the region’s supplies and lackluster European consumption weighs on Brent.</p>
      <p>“Given the bulk of the cuts stem from medium and heavy Middle Eastern producers, we would not be surprised to see Dubai trade at a premium to Brent in the coming months, particularly as China looks to ramp imports,” RBC analysts including Mike Tran and Helima Croft wrote in a report.</p>

    	<p>Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia, moving beyond the US$28,000 mark. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained, with Polygon’s Matic token leading the winners. Polygon’s blockchain is also seeing a surge in non-fungible token (NFT) sales. U.S. equities fell as job openings declined to the lowest since May 2021, signaling a cooling economy and stirring concern about a recession after a year-long series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.</p>
	    <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin gained 1.36% to US$28,172 in the last 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 3.32% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency added almost 3% by mid-morning in Asia trading. Ethereum rose 3.35% to US$1,870, a weekly gain of 5.53%.</li>
        <li>Polygon’s Matic token was the biggest gainer out of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, adding 3.84% to US$1.14 for a weekly gain of 4.74%. Polygon’s y00ts NFT sale was the largest among all blockchains in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning, according to Polygon’s official Twitter handle.</li>
        <li>“Compared to this time last year, Polygon is seeing roughly 3-5x the number of unique sellers, buyers, and total transactions monthly. This is largely due to non-NFT traders now being exposed to non-fungible tokens through Starbucks rewards and Reddit Avatars,” said Yehudah Petscher, strategist at Forkast Labs’ NFT data specialist unit, Cryptoslam.</li>
        <li>Dogecoin, which surged Tuesday following Elon Musk’s move to change Twitter’s blue bird icon to the memecoin’s Shiba Inu dog image, fell back 0.89% to US$0.09523. The meme token’s value jumped 29% over the last seven days, which seems to have awakened some wallets, with Whale Alert noting one containing 1.2 million Doge activated after more than nine years dormant.</li>
        <li>The global crypto market capitalization rose 1.43% to US$1.19 trillion while the total market trade volume dipped 14% to US$42.06 billion in the last 24 hours.</li>
        <li>In the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT Index dipped 0.11% to 4,035.10 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but added 0.74% for the week. The CryptoSlam index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.</li>
        <li>From Jan. 1, 2022, to April 4, 2022, the Forkast 500 showed the market fell almost 12% and for the same period through April 4 this year, the index is down just 2%, said Petscher. “We trade in cycles so I’m curious if we really have much further to fall, or if we’ve found some sort of floor that’s supported by collectors that are here for the long haul,” he said.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.59%, and the S&P 500 lost 0.58%. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.52%.</li>
        <li>The number of job openings in the U.S. fell to 9.9 million in February, the lowest since May 2021 and below market expectations of 10.4 million, indicating a cooling economy, according to Trading Economics.</li>
        <li>The data points indicate the Fed’s battle against inflation may be working, but at the same time concern is growing that with U.S. interest rates now between 4.75% to 5%, or the highest in 17 years, the central bank may have gone too far and the world’s biggest economy could slide into a recession. Analysts at the CME Group have shifted in their view on the outcome of the Fed May 3 meeting to decide on interest rates, with a majority of analysts, about 59%, predicting no change, while 41.1% expect a 25 basis-point rise.</li>
        <li>U.S. stock futures traded higher of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index Futures edged up 0.098%, S&P 500 Futures gained 0.097% and the  Nasdaq-100 Futures added 0.13%.</li>

    	<h3>By Seher Dareen</h3>
    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices hit their highest since March 2022 on Wednesday, extending a rally after weaker U.S. economic readings bolstered bets U.S. interest rates will rise more slowly.</p>
    	<p>Spot gold was up 0.1% to $2,022.79 per ounce by 1120 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were unchanged at $2,038.10.</p>	
    	<p>Analysts said gold was well-placed to sustain gains above the $2,000 level as weaker prospects for interest dilute the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, which is also a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.</p>	
    	<p>"The 'third time's the charm' for gold, having probed above the $2,000 level in both August 2020 and March 2022. This time it appears to be able to sustain the momentum as dark clouds gather within the economy," independent analyst Ross Norman said.</p>
      <p>He said weaker economic data had shifted the emphasis from "inflation-busting to saving the wider economy".</p>
      <p>Gold rallied 2% on Tuesday after U.S. job openings in February dropped to the lowest in nearly two years.</p>
      <p>The dollar index edged higher, yet still near two-month lows, making bullion cheaper for buyers holding other currencies. [USD/]</p>
      <p>There has also been an improvement in the gold market mood, said Carsten Menke, head of Next Generation Research at Julius Baer in a note, "indicated by the return of short-term speculative traders and trend followers".</p>
      <p>Euro zone recovery gathered pace last month but the upturn was uneven, and the ECB could raise rates by 25 basis points at its May, June and July meetings a Reuters poll found.</p>
      <p>While the markets expect a pause on U.S. rate hikes in May, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said the central bank likely had more rate hikes ahead, pushing the terminal rate over 5%.</p>
      <p>Traders also await economic cues from the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday.</p>
      <p>Silver was down 1.1% to $24.74 per ounce, platinum gained 0.6% to $1,022.99 while palladium jumped 1.2% to $1,474.73.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The British pound has rallied during the trading session on Tuesday to pierce the 1.25 level. The 1.25 level is an area of significant psychological importance, and we had been looking at this chart through the prism of meeting the resistance between the 1.24 level in the 1.25 level. The question now is whether or not we can continue to go higher, because if we do it would be a major breakout for a longer-term move from everything I can see on the charts.</p>
    	<p>However, if we turn around and give this up, it could be a sign that this is a barrier that simply cannot be broken. In that scenario, we would see the market drop to the 1.23 level more likely than not, and then perhaps down to the moving averages underneath. Speaking of moving averages, the 50-Day EMA has broken above the 200-Day EMA in the so-called “golden cross.” Ultimately, longer-term “buy-and-hold” traders are attracted to this type of setup.</p>	
	    <p>Keep in mind that a lot of this comes down to the Federal Reserve and what traders think it will do, as there is a sizable amount of the population that thinks the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates rather soon, so they are trying to price in a weaker US dollar. That being said, the reason the Federal Reserve would have to cut would be due to recession. Over the longer term, the US dollar tends to perform fairly well in these recessions, because although interest rates will drop, the reality is that there is very little in the way of global growth to support other currencies.</p>	
    	<p>Nonetheless, the most important thing you can do is pay attention to what the market is actually doing, not what it “should be doing.” I think as traders we all make this mistake from time to time. That being said, if we get a daily close well above the 1.25 level, you have to assume that the British pound will continue to go much higher, but we will have to wait and see.</p>

    	<h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has rallied significantly during the trading session on Tuesday to breakout to a fresh, new, high. The market has broken above the ¥166 level, and now is threatening the top of the major wipeout candlestick after the Bank of Japan announced that they were going to allow the 10 year JGB to rise to 50 basis points instead of 25.

This currency pair had been a bit of a laggard until the last couple of days, and now looks as if it’s ready to lead the charge against the Japanese yen.</p>
	    <p>That being said, the market is entering an area that is very noisy, so I don’t think that it’s simply going to take off to the upside. That being said, as long as we can stay above the ¥164 level, then it’s likely that we could have buyers on dips going forward. Alternatively, you should also pay attention to the fact that the 50-Day EMA is starting to shift to the upside, breaking above the 200-Day EMA. The so-called “golden cross” is an indicator that a lot of longer-term players in the market watch, but it’s also worth noting that the moving averages had been flat previously, so it’s still a little early to call for some type of longer-term breakout.</p>	
	    <p>Going forward it’s more likely than not going to be a situation where you’re looking for value, and of course paying attention to interest rates. As they rise, the Japanese yen takes it on the chin, as the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control monetary policy. Keep in mind that this pair is somewhat turbocharged compared to many others, so even if you aren’t trading this one, and gives you a good idea as to where other yen related pairs might be going. In other words, you could think of it as a secondary indicator in a market that is all about interest rates at the moment. Furthermore, the market has formed a very strong looking candle, so it does suggest that there’s probably plenty of interest.</p>

	<h3>uro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	<p>The Euro has initially shot higher during the course of the trading session on Tuesday, breaking above the 1.09 level. That being said, the market is in an extreme high, so it’ll be interesting to see if we can hang onto these gains. The US dollar of course is suffering at the hands of traders expectations of the interest-rate markets, and whether or not they are going to continue to see interest rates possibly fall going forward in America. If that’s going to be the case, then obviously it works against the US dollar. However, the Federal Reserve has reiterated that inflation is nowhere near where they wanted to be, so I do think that the market will probably end up being somewhat disappointed.</p>
	<p>Nonetheless, it doesn’t really matter what the fundamentals are if the price doesn’t agree. Because of this, I’ll be watching very closely the area between the 1.09 level and the 1.10 level. This area has been very difficult to overcome in the past, so one would have to assume there is a certain amount of selling pressure here. If we were to break down below the bottom of the Monday candlestick, that would obviously be very negative, and could send this market reeling. Speaking of which, it is a bit interesting to see just how deep we plunged during the day on Monday at one point.</p>	
	<p>I would expect a lot of choppy and noisy behavior over the next several sessions as we try to sort everything out. Keep in mind that Friday is Good Friday, and of course we have to think about the idea of the market trying to sort out the idea of a holiday and the Non-Farm Payroll announcement comes out at the same time. Ultimately, this could set up a rather strange week. Furthermore, as most markets will be closed on Friday, it might just be a matter of being in a bit of a holding pattern between now and then. The Euro has its own issues, but at this point it looks like the ECB is going to continue to see a reason to be hawkish as well, so at the end of the day, it could just be a bit of a wash.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has gone back and forth during the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now hanging around the 50-Day EMA. The question is whether or not we are going to break out to the upside, as the 0.68 level has been a bit of a major barrier for some time. The fact that we pierced that level and then turned around suggests that perhaps we aren’t quite ready to go higher. If we break down below the lows of the day, it’s possible that we could go down to the 0.6650 level. That’s where we took off from during the previous session, and therefore one would have to assume there is a significant amount of demand in that region.</p>

	    <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar has gone back and forth during the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now hanging around the 50-Day EMA. The question is whether or not we are going to break out to the upside, as the 0.68 level has been a bit of a major barrier for some time. The fact that we pierced that level and then turned around suggests that perhaps we aren’t quite ready to go higher. If we break down below the lows of the day, it’s possible that we could go down to the 0.6650 level. That’s where we took off from during the previous session, and therefore one would have to assume there is a significant amount of demand in that region.</p>
	    <p>The 0.68 level being broken to the upside makes a move toward the 200-Day EMA. If the market were to move above the indicator, then it opens up a longer term uptrend. I would also expect to see a move towards the 0.70 level. I do think this is a situation where the risk appetite will have a lot to do with what happens next, but it’s worth noting that the RBA sat still overnight, so it suggests that perhaps interest rate differentials won’t have much to say.</p>	
	    <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to the commodity markets, and of course global growth. At this point, it seems like it’s a bit of a mixed picture across the board, so I think you will continue to see a lot of volatility in this pair. The Australian dollar also represents a certain amount of risk appetite, so you have to be willing to keep that in mind as well. It does make a certain amount of sense that we would consolidate in this area, because it has been so important. However, if we can get a reasonable impulsive candlestick, then it could give you an idea as to which direction we are going, and then it’s simply a matter of following the momentum in this market. The momentum has been contained for a while, and the fact that we reversed after the massive shot higher on Monday suggests that it will remain so.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil eked out a gain after a report showed that US job openings in February fell to the lowest since 2021, reigniting concerns over a global economic slowdown.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate settled above $80 paring gains on disappointing labor data after initially rising almost 2%. Before the US economic report, prices had extended the largest rally in a year stemming from the surprise decision Sunday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to slash crude production by over 1 million barrels a day.</p>	
	    <p>Short-term upside is limited until the market sees more inventory draws and stronger demand, said Jonathan Wagner, global head of crude options at Marex North America. “In this macro environment, ahead of payrolls this Friday, the signal of employers not looking for workers is not helping,” said Wagner.</p>	
	    <p>Crude has soared about 20% from the low point in mid-March. The rebound was driven initially by expectations Chinese demand would pick up following the end of restrictive Covid policies. The OPEC+ surprise decision allowed markets to rally the most in a year, with the move being aimed to punish speculators that bet oil prices would fall.</p>
      <p>While uber-bull Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded their price forecasts in the wake of the decision, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. kept forecasts unchanged. Morgan Stanley even lowered its outlook, noting China’s demand growth has lagged behind expectations.</p>
      <p>The market largely ignored the potential resumption of oil exports from Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region on Tuesday. The region’s government said it will sign an agreement that may clear the path to restart shipments via the Turkish port of Ceyhan.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil said it’s restarting units over the coming days at the oil complex near Le Havre in France that had been halted after protests disrupted supplies.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Teck Resources Ltd. is willing to entertain offers from potential suitors after it finishes the spinoff of its steelmaking coal business, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
    	<p>The Canadian miner said Monday it rejected an unsolicited $23 billion proposal from Glencore Plc and will forge ahead with an April 26 shareholder vote on separating its metals and coal divisions. If investors approve, the split is expected to happen by the end of May, with the base metals producer being renamed Teck Metals Corp.</p>	
    	<p>At that point, the Teck board is likely to be open to hearing offers from prospective partners or buyers including Glencore, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.</p>	
    	<p>The Swiss commodities firm’s offer for Teck, at a 20% premium, is another sign that big mining companies are on the hunt for acquisitions. BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto Plc are also said to be actively looking to increase their copper exposure.</p>
      <p>“The board and special committee are confident that the proposed separation into Teck Metals and Elk Valley Resources is in the best interests of Teck and all its stakeholders,” Chris Stannell, a spokesperson for Teck, said in an emailed statement. “Teck’s proposed separation positions Teck Metals and EVR for success and does not foreclose future opportunities for other value-enhancing transactions at the appropriate point and time.”</p>
      <p>In rejecting Glencore’s all-share offer, Teck Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Price said Monday that the spinoff structure proposed by the Swiss firm would expose Teck shareholders to its large thermal coal and oil trading businesses. Norman Keevil, Teck’s chairman emeritus, said that “now is not the time to explore a transaction of this nature.”</p>
      <p>Teck has also proposed ending the dual-class share structure that gives control to Class A shareholders — the Keevil family and its partners. But that change wouldn’t take effect for six years. In the meantime, a hostile takeover of Teck is impossible.</p>

       <li>Dogecoin jumped 20% on Monday after Twitter users noticed the token's Shiba Inu mascot on Twitter's website.</li>
       <li>Elon Musk, who's regularly pumped the meme coin, also brushed off a lawsuit related to the token.</li>
       <li>Musk's lawyers defended his "silly" tweets about the coin, asking a judge to toss a $258 billion suit.</li>
      </ul>
	    <p>Dogecoin, the meme cryptocurrency that counts Elon Musk among its most famous supporters, soared 20% on Monday after the token's Shiba Inu mascot replaced the bird logo on Twitter's website. Meanwhile, Musk brushed off a lawsuit accusing him of running a pyramid scheme, with lawyers for the exec asking a judge to throw out the $258 billion case.</p>
	    <p>The price of Dogecoin surged to $.09 as of 2:30 pm ET, up about 19%.</p>	
	    <p>The jump occurred as Twitter users noticed Dogecoin's distinctive Shiba Inu logo had replaced the bird icon on Twitter's website, per Decrypt's report.</p>	
	    <p>The surge behind the token's price also comes a few days after Musk refuted claims from dogecoin investors alleging in a new lawsuit that Musk's well-documented affinity for the meme token was part of a "pyramid scheme" to support the cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Musk's lawyers filed a request on Friday to dismiss the $258 billion suit, calling the claims brought forward a "fanciful work of fiction." They added that Musk's tweets about dogecoin, which include statements like "no highs, no lows, only Doge," were merely "innocuous" and "silly" remarks from the tech mogul.</p>
      <p>When Insider reached out to Twitter for comment regarding the logo change and the lawsuit, Twitter responded with a poop emoji, which Musk previously said was the new auto-response to any email sent to Twitter's press team.</p>
      <p>Musk has regularly tweeted about dogecoin for years, and first promoted it to his Twitter followers in 2019, when he said that the meme token was his "fav cryptocurrency."</p>
      <p>The coin's valued peaked around $0.74 in mid-2021, but has since spiked periodically, often on comments from Musk. Dogecoin's last big jump came late last year, with the crypto gaining around $10 billion in market value as Musk began his takeover of Twitter.</p>

	    <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has fallen below $28,000 (£22,730) as regulatory action against the crypto industry intensifies and the US government announces a schedule to sell 41,490 BTC in 2023.</p>
	    <p>The global cryptocurrency market cap stood at $1.21tn on Monday, a drop of 2.1%, according to Coingecko.</p>	
	    <p>Bitcoin fell 2.2% to $27,887.</p>	
	    <p>The recent price action has left bitcoin's market capitalisation at $538bn. But, bitcoin's price has risen by 67.76% so far this year.</p>
      <p>Ethereum (ETH-USD) fell 1.27% to $1,790.</p>
      <p>The Ethereum Foundation said last week that the blockchain's Shanghai hard fork, featuring an upgrade enabling investors to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, is set for 12 April.</p>
      <h3>US to sell over 41,000 bitcoin</h3>
      <p>Last month, the US government sold $216m worth of bitcoin that it had seized during a November 2021 search connected to cryptocurrency that had been stolen from the Silk Road dark web marketplace.</p>
      <p>The bitcoin sold was a portion of a 50,000 BTC haul that was seized following the arrest of James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud after the government alleged he manipulated the transaction system on Silk Road in 2012.</p>
      <p>The US government plans to sell the remaining 41,490 bitcoins in four separate portions throughout 2023, according to a court filing.</p>
      <h3>Ripple versus the SEC</h3>
      <p>XRP (XRP-USD) climbed 3.06% to $0.5192 — a 15.57% weekly increase.</p>
      <p>It is thought that Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment platform utilises XRP, will soon resolve its ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
      <p>The SEC has accused the company and its executives of violating securities regulations.</p>
      <p>SEC chair Gary Gensler asked Congress for $2.4bn in funding last Wednesday to enhance the agency's efforts in combating cryptocurrency-related malpractices.</p>
      <h3>Binance versus the CFTC</h3>
      <p>The cryptocurrency market has experienced instability due to last week's litigation from US regulators against crypto exchange Binance.</p>
      <p>Last Monday, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an enforcement action against Binance and its founder Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao.</p>
      <p>According to the CFTC, which has been investigating Binance’s business since 2021, the company failed to meet its regulatory obligations by not properly registering with the derivatives regulator.</p>
      <p>The CFTC classifies bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD) and litecoin (LTC-USD) as commodities and has accused Binance of conducting unregistered derivative trading with these digital assets.</p>
      <p>Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has also been accused of encouraging Americans to “evade compliance controls” by the US regulator.</p>
      <h3>UK banks restricting web3 firms, claims report</h3>
      <p>The UK cryptocurrency sector is finding it increasingly difficult to access banking services, with restrictions on web3 firms holding back Britain's aspiration to become a "global crypto hub", a new report has claimed.</p>
      <p>The few banks that continue to collaborate with web3 businesses are requiring more extensive documentation, with problems ranging from having applications rejected to getting buried in paperwork, according to the report by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Web3 firm SavingBlocks said it applied to nine banking service providers for a corporate account and was turned down by seven of them. Those that did offer services asked for "insurmountable" additional documentation.</p>
      <p>“There aren’t many options available, most traditional banks won’t offer banking services to crypto firms," Edouard Daunizeau, SavingBlocks founder and CEO, told Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>“With the recent string of events it will be even tougher, so we are now seeking licenses in France where we think it will be easier."</p>
      <p>Some web3 founders have complained to the UK government, saying that the limitations contradict prime minister Rishi Sunak's intention to prioritise financial technology innovation and establish the UK as a global crypto hub.</p>
      <p>“The UK banking reaction has been more acute than the EU one," Tom Duff-Gordon, vice president of international policy at Coinbase (COIN), told Bloomberg. He said that the European Union's efforts to create a digital asset framework make banks in other countries more open to working with crypto firms.</p>
      <p>The European parliamentary committee approved the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation in October, with the final vote set to take place this month.</p>
      <p>The UK is losing ground to the rest of Europe, according to the Bloomberg report, as data from PitchBook showed venture capital funding for UK digital asset companies has experienced a 94% decline over the past year.</p>
      <p>The EU saw a 31% increase in investments during the same period.</p>
      <h3>Equity markets</h3>
      <p>US stocks advanced on Friday, as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure indicated signs of cooling, and a potential end to the Fed's monetary tightening cycle.</p>
      <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) increased by 1.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively.</p>

	    <p>The Euro has rallied significantly during the trading week to test the 1.09 level, an area that has been resistance previously, extending to the 1.10 level for selling pressure. Ultimately, this is a market that will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior in general, and therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that we could fall from here. If we do, then it’s possible that the market could go down to the 1.07 level, followed by the 1.06 level, both of which are areas that we’ve seen a little bit of support at.</p>
	    <p>Keep in mind that the interest-rate situation in the United States continues to be parsed, and of course traders are still trying to figure out whether or not the Federal Reserve is going to continue to see a reason to tighten monetary policy. Ultimately, this is a situation where we also have to worry about risk appetite, because if things get truly ugly, the US dollar continues to see money running into the currency to get into the bond market for safety.</p>	
	    <p>On the other hand, if we do turn around and break above the 1.11 level, then it opens up a much bigger move to the upside. While this has been a big move higher, I also recognize that we are still below the 200-Week EMA, and of course have had a nice bounce, but were still just around the 50% Fibonacci level of the overall selloff that happened previously. Another thing to be concerned about is the fact that there are still quite a few issues in the banking sector, giving you the likelihood of the US dollar being a safe haven going forward.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished higher this Friday as the UK economy grew by more than first thought in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.29% to close at 7,642 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1% to 7,336 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) gained 0.83% to 15,652.</p>	
	    <h3>UK avoids recession</h3>
      <p>Revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed that the UK economy avoided recession in the second half of last year, posting 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter.</p>	
	    <p>The economy shrank in the third quarter of last year, but Friday’s data confirmed that the economy did not shrink for two successive quarters, which is the technical definition of recession.</p>
      <p>Gabriella Dickens at Pantheon Macroeconomics noted the UK is still is the only G7 economy in which GDP has not yet recovered to the same level as quarter four of 2019, before the pandemic struck.</p>
      <p>“Indeed, GDP still was 0.6% lower than it was three years ago in the UK, whereas it was 5.1% higher in the US, 2.9% higher in Canada, 0.8% in Japan, 1.2% in France, 1.9% in Italy and just back in line in Germany,” she said.</p>
      <p>The dominant services sector grew by 0.1%, boosted by a jump of nearly 11% for travel agents.</p>
      <p>Manufacturing was up by 0.5%, driven by the pharmaceutical sector, and construction grew 1.3%.</p>
      <p>ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy performed a little more strongly in the latter half of last year than previously estimated, with later data showing telecommunications, construction and manufacturing all faring better than initially thought in the latest quarter."</p>
      <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Wall Street pushed higher on Friday as the final trading day of an eventful first quarter got underway.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.73% to 33,098 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.77% to 4,082 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 0.99% to 12,132.</p>
      <p>Stock futures perked up on Friday morning after inflation data showed further cooling in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.</p>
      <p>In February, "core" PCE, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy, rose 0.3% over the prior month and 4.6% over last year, with the annual increase coming in below Wall Street expectations for a 4.7% rise.</p>
      <p>A slowdown in inflation could ease pressure the Federal Reserve feels to continue with its rate-hiking campaign, which Fed officials earlier this week suggested will likely continue this spring given price increases that remain too high and a bank crisis that has shown signs of ebbing.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 0.93% to 28,041 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong rose 0.74% to 20,459. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, rising 0.36% to 3,272 points.</p>
      <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
      <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado Group (OCDO.L) rose 2.27% after it said had "comprehensively won" the patent infringement suit brought by AutoStore (AUTO.OL).</p>
      <p>Miner Rio Tinto (RIO.L) rose 0.86% after signing a joint venture with Canada's First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) to develop the La Granja copper project in Peru.</p>
      <p>Rolls-Royce (RR.L) saw shares jump after it announced a new chief financial officer (CFO). The new boss of Rolls-Royce hired Helen McCabe from his alma mater BP (BP.L) as CFO. However, the stock was trading at a loss in afternoon trading and closed 0.69% lower.</p>
      <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) was flat against the dollar, trading around $1.23.</p>
      <p>It was also weaker against the euro, with sterling (GBPEUR=X) hovering around €1.13.</p>
      <p>Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING, said: “The pound is set to be the best-performing currency of the first quarter of 2023, having gained 2.5% against the dollar”.</p>
      <p>“Along with the improvement in the economic outlook, sterling is definitely drawing benefits from the market’s conviction that the Bank of England will need to continue raising rates.”</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $79 per barrel, as traders await the release of the personal consumption expenditures index on Friday, an indicator of US inflation that is certain to move oil prices.</p>
      <p>Fear of supply disruptions continues to dominate the global oil market, so Brent is set to end the week higher despite the volatility.</p>

    	<p>The energy sector led the decline among commodities in the first quarter. Bucking the trend: copper, gold, steel, and iron ore.</p>
    	<p>Commodities declined in the first quarter, with the energy sector leading the way as markets were jolted in March by sudden stress in the U.S. banking system. Prices for natural gas lost more than half of their value and touched their lowest level in more than two years.</p>	
	    <p>Fear that interest rates will be higher for longer quickly transitioned to views that there will be cuts in rates, says Albert Chu, portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management. That led to growth areas like technology getting a “bid at the expense of ‘value’ assets,” while fears of a banking contagion also started to dent demand.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Arbitrum [ARB] has been receiving a lot of attention due to its recent token AirDrop. The dApps on the Arbitrum network seem to have taken advantage of this attention as many of them observed growth after the AirDrop.</p>
    	<p>Santiment’s data revealed that Stargate, a DeFi protocol operating on the Arbitrum network, experienced a significant increase in its network growth despite a 51% decrease in the value of its token STG.</p>
    	<p>Another dApp that witnessed growth was GMX. According to Dapp Radar, the overall volume on the GMX protocol increased by 6.72% in the past 30 days. During this period, the number of unique active wallets on the GMX network also increased.</p>	
    	<p>These developments led to a 28.6% surge in the TVL of Arbitrum last week, according to data provided by L2Beats.</p>	
    	<h3>Still a long way to go</h3>
      <p>However, the growth of the aforementioned dApps wasn’t reflected by the Arbitrum network. According to Artemis’ data, the daily activity addresses on the network declined materially over the last few days, falling from 611,000 addresses to 167,300 addresses at press time.</p>
      <p>This decline in activity was observed despite Arbitrum offering lower transaction fees to its users, which helped them save higher amounts of ETH on each of their transactions. According to Dune Analytics’ data, Arbitrum outperformed other L2 solutions like Optimism in terms of savings provided to users.</p>
      <p>Even though there was a decline in activity on Arbitrum, there wasn’t much of an impact on the revenue that was being generated. According to Token Terminal’s data, the revenue rose by 22.7% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The number of active developers on the network spiked during this period as well. This indicated that Arbitrum was capitalizing on the renewed attention on its network to roll out new upgrades and updates on the network.</p>

        <li>The support zone at $0.071 could see a minor bullish reaction.</li>
      </ul>
	    <p>The higher timeframe price charts of Dogecoin [DOGE] showed strong bearish pressure on one of the most popular meme coins. The $0.08 region has posed stern resistance since early March, and this does not look likely to change soon.</p>
    	<p>Bitcoin [BTC] could see some volatility after dropping to $26.5k on 27 March. In this scenario, a bounce for DOGE would offer short sellers a better risk-to-reward region to sell Dogecoin.</p>	
	    <p>There were two scenarios that short-term bears can watch out for. One is a drop beneath the $0.071 region, highlighted in cyan. This would be a strongly bearish scenario, and bears can look to short the retest of this region as resistance. They can target the zones of support at $0.068 and $0.065 to take profits. An extremely wide stop-loss can be used above the recent Monday’s swing high.</p>	
	    <p>The blue line at $0.0713 marked a strong lower timeframe zone of support for DOGE. The second scenario that could unfold was a bounce from this region that reached the $0.075-$0.078 area.</p>
      <p>A move into this zone can also be shorted, with a stop-loss above the $0.0805 mark. This could offer a better R: R trade and sellers can take partial profits at the support zones if they choose to.</p>
      <p>The RSI on the two-hour chart has not surfaced above neutral 50 since 24 March, which highlighted a near-term downtrend. The CMF was also at -0.10 to indicate significant capital flow out of the Dogecoin market.</p>
      <p>Dogecoin reached a swing high of $0.0764 on Monday and dropped to test the $0.0713 support level just a couple of hours later. This constituted a drop of 6.7%, and the futures traders remained sidelined or lost money.</p>
      <p>The Open Interest dove from $261 million to $243 million after this move, and Coinalyze’s data showed $1.6 million worth of long positions were liquidated in those two hours. However, the predicted funding rate was positive, which hinted at slight bullishness. Overall, the inference was bearish sentiment toward DOGE.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- European and US equity futures rose alongside Asian shares as the Hong Kong market rallied on a planned revamp of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. that bodes well for Chinese technology companies.</p>
	    <p>Contracts for the region-wide Euro Stoxx 50 equity benchmark moved around 0.4% higher, broadly in line with an advance in US futures that effectively canceled a decline Tuesday. A gauge of Asian stocks rose for a second day as benchmarks in Japan and Australia also increased.</p>	
	    <p>Investors rushed back to Alibaba shares and other large tech companies that have been stung by a crackdown from Beijing over the past two years. Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares surged around 14%, tracking a jump in its US-listed stock after the e-commerce giant said it would split into six units in a shakeup that promises to yield multiple initial public offerings.</p>	
	    <p>The Hang Seng Index advanced around 2% and a measure of Hong Kong-listed tech firms jumped about 3% in an updraft that buoyed Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc., and Japan-listed Softbank Group Corp., which owns a large stake in Alibaba.</p>
      <p>Treasuries were little changed in Asian trading after the two-year yield rose eight basis points and the 10-year equivalent climbed four basis points Tuesday.</p>
      <p>An index of the dollar edged higher after ending Tuesday near the lowest level in eight weeks. The Australian dollar weakend after slower-than-forecast inflation data bolstered the case for the central bank to pause its run of interest-rate increases.</p>
      <p>Investors are preparing for a raft of data on the US economy this week, including the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation — the so-called core PCE deflator — which is likely to factor into the Federal Reserve’s next policy decision.</p>
      <p>St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said “appropriate monetary policy can continue to put downward pressure on inflation” despite the turmoil in US regional banks. Meanwhile, consumers appear to have shrugged off the bank failures, with the latest consumer confidence figures unexpectedly higher in March.</p>
      <p>Swaps traders have priced in more than a 50% probability the Fed will raise rates by a quarter point at its next meeting, with plans to ease thereafter. However, several strategists have joined BlackRock Investment Institute in saying markets are wrong in expecting imminent rate cuts.</p>
      <p>“The banking crisis and the new tighter standards for banks is equivalent to one to two rate hikes,” said Eva Ados, chief investment strategist for ERShares, in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There is a big possibility here of a pricing mistake. We are pricing in the rate drop rather than the reason why rates are dropping, which is the banking crisis.”</p>
      <p>Underscoring how much disruption has been caused by the turmoil in the banking sector, UBS Group AG said Sergio Ermotti would return as chief executive officer. He’s replacing Ralph Hamers after just over two years in charge as the UBS looks to the veteran banker to oversee the complicated acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, oil was higher after a clash between Iraq and its Kurdish region curtailed exports. Gold fell slightly and Bitcoin traded around $27,400.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- Europe has negotiated through the winter of a crisis that threatened to choke energy supplies and overwhelm its economy, but officials are warning that the squeeze may not yet be over.</p>
	    <p>Fears of blackouts and freezing homes have faded for now, and gas reserves remain far fuller than normal. The region is entering a crucial period of replenishing those stockpiles, and avoiding a crunch next winter hinges on its success. It won’t be able to rely on the usually massive supply of pipeline gas from Russia, and EU officials are leaning on companies to end LNG imports from the country.</p>	
	    <p>The perils from a year ago will be fresh on policy makers’ minds. Heat waves, the worst drought in centuries, nuclear outages in France and overall panic about Russia’s dwindling gas exports resulted in a record surge in prices. They’ve fallen more than 80% since then, and the outlook holds few worries for the months ahead. BloombergNEF sees enough supplies available to fill inventories to the EU’s goal of 90% by the end of October.</p>	
	    <p>The market remains wary a repeat of last year’s events will flip the balance once again. There are also new worries about a rebound in Chinese demand, and an even deeper curtailment in Russian supplies — pipeline and liquefied natural gas, said Andrew Walker, a vice president at major LNG provider Cheniere Energy Inc.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of key risks sitting out there,” he said at the European Gas Conference in Vienna.</p>
      <p>With summer coming and small volumes of gas already starting to be sent into storage sites, here are some of the biggest concerns for the continent.</p>
      <p>China and Fight for LNG</p>
      <p>Record LNG imports formed the backbone of Europe’s efforts to tackle the crisis over the past year. But the jostling for cargoes could start increasing.</p>
      <p>The International Energy Agency has warned that Europe still faces a risk of supply shortages this year, unless it further curbs consumption, with China’s LNG demand being the biggest unknown. The agency has a 40 billion cubic meters difference between its highest and lowest estimates for the nation’s net LNG imports this year. That’s the equivalent of about 8% of Europe’s total demand last year.</p>
      <p>Some industry watchers, like Wood Mackenzie, are not very bullish, at least for now. The consultant expects China’s booming domestic gas production and continued increase in Russia’s pipeline supplies to limit the need for LNG imports, and keep them below the peak of 2021 even in a high-growth scenario.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, cheaper LNG is also bringing back appetite from smaller buyers in Asia, which increases competition, according to trader Vitol Group.</p>
      <p>Industrial Demand Recovery</p>
      <p>Signs are emerging that gas use by industry — which made up almost half of total demand reduction in Europe last year — is rebounding. A recovery is showing in the oil refining and petrochemical industries in Spain, the Netherlands and France, where it is easier to switch fuels than in other sectors.</p>
      <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and SEB AB have warned that gas prices may more than double from current levels if industrial demand returns. But how big will the rebound be? Many manufacturers shut or relocated some operations last year as energy costs turned prohibitive, and there’s no certainty they will return. An unfolding banking crisis could also hit European industries.</p>
      <p>Fuel Switching</p>
      <p>Declining gas prices are making it attractive again for Europe’s power stations, in comparison to alternatives like coal or oil.</p>
      <p>Coal power generation in Europe increased last year, ending a run of steady declines. It has been lower so far this year — as has gas — because of higher renewables output, primarily wind. But, gas use for electricity outstripped coal at times over the past month, according to consultant Rystad Energy AS. The shift is also aided by more expensive carbon permits, which are needed by power stations to spew emissions.</p>
      <p>French Nukes</p>
      <p>Electricite de France SA’s troubles are quickly turning out to be one of the biggest risks to Europe avoiding another crisis next winter. The beleaguered utility’s nuclear stations have suffered from technical errors, contributing to a record number of reactors going offline last year in the country and pushing atomic output to the lowest in 30 years.</p>
      <p>As a result, power was the only sector in Europe where gas consumption remained relatively steady last year even though overall electricity demand declined, while wind and solar output jumped.</p>
      <p>EDF has found new defects that have caused energy prices to spike several times this month. While the company has left its nuclear power production forecast for this year unchanged, more problems would further strain power networks and increase demand for gas. Widespread strikes in the country haven’t helped either.</p>
      <p>Another Drought?</p>
      <p>Memories of the arterial Rhine River drying up and becoming impassable last year are still fresh, as is the record heat and droughts that limited hydroelectric and nuclear production. Climate change is making severe weather events more likely.</p>
      <p>The hydrological balance in the Alps — or the amount of energy stored in reservoirs and snowpack compared with seasonal norms — already shows the biggest deficit since 2017 for the time of year. Hot weather could boost demand for gas for cooling, and if the Rhine dries up again, it can disrupt the movement of coal and oil products to Germany.</p>
      <p>Russia Risk</p>
      <p>Russia’s share of total gas demand in the European Union dropped to under 10% by the end of last year from 40% in 2021 as most nations switched to alternatives such as US LNG. Even that little supply, especially the part coming by pipelines crossing Ukraine, has been under constant risk as the war moves into its second year.</p>
      <p>While pipeline flows have dwindled, imports of LNG — which aren’t restricted — from the country have surged. But there’s now growing pressure on European companies to end these purchases. Some like the UK and the Baltic nations have already banned these imports. The EU is targeting a way to allow members to follow suit but it isn’t implementing any new sanctions or announcing specific measures.</p>
      <p>Spain, one of Europe’s top buyers of the Russian fuel, has directly urged companies to reduce these purchases, but a blanket ban would be challenging to achieve.</p>
      <p>Russia accounted for 14% of total European LNG imports last year, said Leo Kabouche, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. If the region were to ban those flows, the loss would be “significant and would be extremely challenging to replace.”</p>
      <p>The possibility of a total cut off from Moscow, risks of infrastructure sabotage or unplanned outages at major projects this year — as well as competition with China — could put the gas market under pressure again, Matthew Baldwin, deputy director general of the European Commission’s energy department, said at the conference in Vienna.</p>
      <p>“We experienced unprecedented, volatile energy prices last year, it looks better but we are not complacent,” he said. “We are not out of the woods. So we stay vigilant, we stay together.”</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - Gold prices retreated on Wednesday as investors trickled back into riskier assets betting that risks of contagion from the global banking crisis have been curbed for now.</p>
	    <p>Spot gold was trading 0.4% lower at $1,965.89 per ounce, as of 0924 GMT. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.3% to $1,967.50.</p>	
	    <p>Gold has retreated as "markets are going risk-on as fears of contagion within the banking sector abates," said independent analyst Ross Norman.</p>
      <p>European shares rose, echoing an upbeat mood in Asian markets. [.EU]</p>
      <p>Further pressuring bullion, the U.S. dollar firmed 0.2%. A stronger dollar makes bullion more expensive for overseas buyers. [USD/]</p>
      <p>Gold traders, meanwhile, remained focused on the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy, with investors pricing in a 40.5% chance of a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME FedWatch tool.</p>
      <p>Last week, the central bank suggested it was on the verge of pausing future hikes, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to reining in inflation.</p>
      <p>"Our outlook for the second half of 2023 for gold remains positive but not outrageously so as inflation persists and the Fed continues to try and edge rates higher until something breaks," Norman added.</p>
      <p>Higher rates tend to dull zero-yield gold's appeal.</p>

	    <p>By Alex Lawler</p>
	    <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil rose for a third session on Wednesday as a halt to some exports from Iraqi Kurdistan raised concerns of tightening supply and as easing fears of a global banking crisis supported risk sentiment in the wider markets.</p>	
	    <p>Crude exports of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region were halted on Saturday following an arbitration decision that confirmed Baghdad's consent was needed to ship the oil.</p>	
	    <p>Brent crude climbed 42 cents, or 0.5%, to $79.07 a barrel by 0802 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude increased 61 cents, or 0.8%, to $73.81.</p>
      <p>"The longer the stoppage continues, the tighter the supply outlook will become," said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Norwegian oil firm DNO said it had begun shutting down production at its fields in Kurdistan. The company's Tawke and Peshkabir fields averaged output of 107,000 bpd in 2022, a quarter of total Kurdish exports.</p>
      <p>Also helping sentiment was easing worries over the banking sector after weeks of volatility in the market that had sent oil to a 15-month low on March 20, with investor nerves soothed by the sale of assets in collapsed lender Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
      <p>"The recent rebound in oil prices is mainly driven by sentiment. We can see that risk sentiment has recovered to some extent, which pushed (the) global stock markets and crude oil rebound," said CMC Markets analyst Leon Li.</p>
      <p>Oil also gained support from a drop in U.S. crude inventories. According to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday, crude stocks fell by 6.1 million barrels.</p>
      <p>Attention will focus on official U.S. inventory data from the Energy Information Administration at 1430 GMT to see if it confirms the crude stock decline.</p>

	    <p>The Dow Jones fell as Alibaba soared. Three stocks, including Coinbase, struggled despite Cathie Wood buying shares. Micron earnings missed.</p>
	    <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped as Treasury yields spiked. A trio of stocks, including Coinbase (COIN), were mixed despite Cathie Wood buying shares. Alibaba (BABA) went on a magic carpet ride while Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) fell. Micron Technology (MU) earnings missed views.</p>	
	    <p>A couple of noteworthy stocks attempted breakouts despite the challenging action. Both CGI (GIB) and Sovos Brands (SOVO) tested buy points, with no success.</p>	
	    <p>Treasury yields continued to rise. The 10-year yield rose 3 basis points to 3.56% while the two-year yield spiked 10 basis points to 4.06%. The yield curve remains inverted, traditionally an indicator of a recession.</p>
      <p>Energy stocks got a boost as West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.8% to more than $73 per barrel. It is continuing to move away from recent lows.</p>
      <h3>Nasdaq Falls, IBD 50 Lags</h3>
      <p>The Nasdaq closed off lows for the day but still fell 0.5%. EV stock Lucid (LCID) underperformed here with a dip of 7.2%.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&P 500 also fell despite rallying into the close. It fell 0.2%. It continues to lag the 50-day moving average. Humana (HUM) was a laggard here as it skidded 4.7%.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 sectors finished the session mixed, with energy and industrials making the best gains. Communications services, health and technology suffered.</p>
      <p>Small caps barely fell, with the Russell 2000 dipping 0.1%. Growth stocks struggled the most, with the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) down 1.5%.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Microsoft, Apple Stock Fall Again</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones industrials also slipped, though not as sharply as the other major indexes. It closed down less than 40 points, or 0.1%.</p>
      <p>Microsoft fought back heading into the close, but still slid 0.4% as Big Tech stocks continued to cede some recent gains. It lost ground on a 276.86 entry, MarketSmith analysis shows.</p>
      <p>Apple also toiled, easing 0.4%. Despite this, it remains clear of its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It also managed to end the session above its 10-day line.</p>
      <p>American Express (AXP) was the worst stock on the Dow Jones today as it fell 2.4%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) led the upside with a gain of 2.7%.</p>
      <h3>These Stocks Struggle Despite Cathie Wood Buys</h3>
      <p>Famed money manager Cathie Wood is never afraid to buy on the dip, but the strategy had mixed luck for three new buys Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cryptocurrency stock Coinbase reversed higher, gaining 0.8%. It is trading near the 50-day moving average. Wood's signature ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) snapped up more than 32,000 shares Monday.</p>
      <p>It came as bitcoin, the most famous digital currency of all, also reversed higher. It also rose 0.8% and remains up nearly 65% for the year.</p>
      <p>Teladoc Health (TDOC) fell 1%, though it closed slightly off the day's lows. It is trading below its major moving averages. ARKK added more than 18,000 shares.</p>
      <p>Joby Aviation (JOBY) also fell 1%, though also off lows. The ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) bought 448,000 shares. This cheap stock does not meet CAN SLIM criteria.</p>
      <h3>Alibaba Stock Goes On Magic Carpet Ride</h3>
      <p>BABA stock soared on news it is splitting itself into six separate business groups. Investors seem excited by the fact that each of these groups could potentially go public to raise outside funding.</p>
      <p>The six are: Cloud Intelligence, Cloud Commerce, Local Services, Cainiao Smart Logistics, Global Digital Commerce Group and Digital Media and Entertainment.</p>
      <p>Each group will have its own board of directors and CEO. The move is "designed to unlock shareholder value and foster market competitiveness," according to a statement from the company.</p>
      <p>The China stock rocketed 14.3%, taking investors on a magic carpet ride in the process. Alibaba stock is now up 7% so far in 2023.</p>
      <h3>Micron Earnings Miss; MU Stock Up Late</h3>
      <p>Chip giant Micron Technology (MU) inched higher after the close following earnings.</p>
      <p>The stock closed lower heading into its report, sliding about 1%. But in extended trading it was up almost 2%. It is testing support at the 50-day moving average. The memory-chip maker is up nearly 18% so far in 2023.</p>
      <p>Micron earnings per share were seen falling from $2.14 last year to a loss of 67 cents this year, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue was expected to dip 52% to $3.76 billion.</p>
      <p>Instead, the Boise, Idaho-based company lost an adjusted $1.91 cents a share on sales of $3.69 billion.</p>
      <p>Micron makes two types of memory chips: DRAM and Nand. DRAM chips act as the main memory in PCs, servers and other devices, working closely with central processing units. Nand flash chips provide longer-term data storage.</p>
      <h3>Outside Dow Jones: These Stocks Test Entries</h3>
      <p>With the stock market currently in a correction, now is the time to be adding to one's watchlist rather than buying stocks. Any buys now carry added risk.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, IT outsourcing play CGI (GIB) briefly cleared a flat-base entry of 94.10. It has since fallen back below this level. Overall performance is strong here, with the stock holding an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of 99.</p>
      <p>Packaged-food play Sovos Brands (SOVO) saw its relative strength line hit new heights as it tested a 16.93 buy point in a saucer base. It closed below that level. This is a first-stage pattern. Early-stage bases are more likely to succeed.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ethereum outflows were on the high side but Bitcoin shied away from a similar fate.</li>
        <li>Other altcoins joined the BTC trend but investors remained wary of ETH.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the third straight week, Ethereum [ETH] investment products failed to attract the purses of digital asset investors, CoinShares’ 27 March report revealed.</p>
      <p>According to the report duly delivered by James Butterfill, the altcoin faced the same fate as that of the previous weeks, seeing a $5.2 million outflow.</p>
      <h3>ETH stuck, BTC finds an escape route</h3>
	    <p>However, products linked to Bitcoin [BTC] had the opposite experience as the inflow was as high as $127.5 million. Every week, CoinShares discloses the activities with respect to crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) across several countries.</p>
	    <p>But before the latest report, both Bitcoin and Ethereum were on the same page. This was largely due to the instability in the traditional finance sector.</p>	
	    <p>However, the trust issues with the banking sector seem to have resulted in gains for the crypto ecosystem. By and large, the overall inflow totaling $160 million was the highest since July 2022.</p>	
	    <p>This hike implies that the level of trust in crypto products was high at the expense of traditional institutions’ offers. CoinShares was of the same view even though it admitted that the inflows were relatively low at the beginning of the previous week. The report stated:</p>
      <p><b>“While the inflows came relatively late compared to the broader crypto market, we believe it is due to increasing fears amongst investors for stability in the traditional finance sector.”</b></p>
      <h3>Until Shanghai leaves the stage</h3>
      <p>But why has Ethereum failed to take a significant share of the input since it was the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value? Well, the long-standing investment group opined that Ethereum’s decline could be due to several factors. And like CoinShares opined last week, the Shanghai upgrade topped the list. The trading firm pointed out,</p>
      <p><b>“We believe investor jitters around the Shanghai upgrade (expected 12th April) are the most likely reason”</b></p>
      <p>The event, expected to happen in a few weeks, would set the grounds for staking withdrawals which could, in turn, result in selling pressure.</p>
      <p>Besides that, recent Ethereum developments have not necessarily resulted in a positive price action. So, it could be valid that investors are being skeptic about committing funds to products related to the altcoin.</p>
      <p>However, Bitcoin was not the only claimant with respect to improved inflow as some other altcoins joined the fray. For instance, Ripple [XRP], which outperformed several cryptocurrencies in the past week got inflows worth $1.2 million.</p>
      <p>Polygon [MATIC], and Solana [SOL] received inflows worth $1.9 million and $4.8 million respectively.</p>

      <p>Almost six months after its Public Testnet, the Polygon [MATIC] zkEVM Mainnet Beta went live on Monday 27 March. The event, which began at 10 a.m. E.T, was broadcast live on YouTube.

        <li>The Polygon team officially deployed the zkEVM Mainnet for public use. </li>
        <li>Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin made the first transaction on the network as over 50 projects were in line to join.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Almost six months after its Public Testnet, the Polygon [MATIC] zkEVM Mainnet Beta went live on Monday 27 March. The event, which began at 10 a.m. E.T, was broadcast live on YouTube. It had in attendance Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s [ETH] co-founder. As expected, Jordin Baylina, technical lead of the Polygon Hermez zkEVM project, was also an active participant.</p>
    	<p>Known to have made its primary objective to scale Ethereum, Polygon considered the zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup as a viable solution to the delays experienced on its optimistic match. The idea behind it was to use the existing smart contracts’ power to reduce transaction costs while utilizing Ethereum’s network security.</p>
    	<h3>Finally, Beta is triumphant</h3>
      <p>In an exclusive press release sent to AMBCrypto, Polygon noted that the Ethereum founder would make the first transaction on the Mainnet. The project’s co-founder, Mihailo Bjelic, who seemed elated in anticipation of the development and Vitalik’s presence, said,</p>	
    	<p><b>“Today’s launch is an incredible milestone and the beginning of a new chapter for blockchain technology, fulfilling Ethereum’s original promise of becoming a true ‘world computer’ and creating a fairer, more egalitarian internet for all.”</b></p>	
    	<p>However, the ability to transact was not the only benefit that Polygon was offering. According to Baylina, the team was also open-sourcing the code. This would allow developers to collaborate and innovate within the community.</p>
      <p>When asked how Polygon could achieve the milestone less than two years after ideation, the technical lead said that it was down to the team’s dedication. Furthermore, he mentioned that the utilization of layers in the zkEVM architecture was vital to its fast execution.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Vitalik was able to make the first successful transaction on the Mainnet in a few minutes. Here, he sent an ETH equivalent of $8.62 to the last address that opened a contract on the zkEVM network.</p>
      <h3>Constraints beaten, but caution may be profitable </h3>
      <p>After the transaction, the Ethereum founder admitted that scalability was one of the project’s limitations in the early days. But with glaring delight, he commented on the success of the Polygon landmark, saying,</p>
      <p><b>“​​Millions of constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind.”</b></p>
      <p>Polygon also mentioned that over 50 web3 enterprises already showed an interest in joining the zkEVM. Some of these included Solana [SOL]-based Phantom, Etherscan, and Aavegotchi.</p>
      <p>The project had pointed out that transacting within the zkEM rollup would take only a matter of seconds. However, the web3 project also warned that users bridging Ethereum could encounter a 30 to 60 minutes’ delay in this first phase.</p>
      <p>Also, there could be vulnerabilities that could hinder the seamless processing of large deposits within this period. Polygon’s president Ryan Wyatt commented on the deployment, noting that there was more to do with the ZK expansion in the long term.</p>

        <li>Solana witnessed a high number of transactions being made on the network.</li>
        <li>However, DEX volume and active addresses on the network fell.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>Solana [SOL] has been in muddy waters for quite some time, having been on the receiving end of criticism due to its frequent downtimes. However, new data revealed that there was a spike in the number of transactions being made on the network.</p>
	    <p>Artemis’ data shows that the volume of transactions on the Solana network has hit its highest point in six months. This resulted in a 22.75% increase in its TVL over the past month, according to DeFiLlama’s data.</p>	
	    <p>Although the Solana network has seen high levels of activity, there has been a decline in interest in its DEXs, as evidenced by the declining volume of DEX transactions on the network.</p>	
	    <p>The decrease in DEX volume on the Solana network could be linked to the underperformance of DeFi protocols like Saber and Radium. Based on data from Dapp Radar, there was a 22.5% drop in the number of unique active wallets on Saber and a 33.97% decrease in the number of unique active wallets on Radium.</p>
      <h3>SOL on the metric front</h3>
      <p>On the social front, things were not going too well for Solana either. According to LunarCrush’s data, the number of social mentions and engagements for Solana fell by 64.7% and 47.11%, respectively. Along with that, the weighted sentiment for Solana also fell. This shows that the crypto community had a pessimistic outlook towards the future of Solana at press time.</p>
      <p>This negative outlook impacted the price of SOL as well, which decreased materially over the last month. Coupled with that, the volume of the SOL token fell from 1.13 billion to 271 million in the same period.</p>
      <p>However, one aspect of the Solana ecosystem that could turn things around for the protocol would be its NFT market. According to Santiment’s data, the number of NFT trades rose over the last few days. If the trend continued, it could dampen the negative sentiment against Solana and make users interested in the protocol and its token again.</p>

    	<p>(Bloomberg) -- Oil clung to gains as a disagreement between Iraq and Kurdish officials curtailed exports and fears of a banking meltdown receded.</p>
    	<p>West Texas Intermediate edged forward Tuesday and has recovered almost 10% since dropping to a 15-month low in the immediate aftermath of the banking crisis. A legal dispute between Iraq, Kurdistan, and Turkey has halted around 400,000 barrels a day of flows, constricting global supplies.</p>	
    	<p>The market shrugged off concerns of a buildup of crude vessels along the coast of France as widespread strikes there forced most of the nation’s fuelmakers to halt operations. Strong Asian demand for the barrels has prevented prices from sliding.</p>	
	    <p>While oil has rallied from recent lows as the banking sector stabilizes, it remains on track for a fifth monthly decline amid concerns over a potential US recession and resilient Russian energy flows. Most market watchers are still betting that China’s recovery will accelerate and boost prices later this year as demand rebounds.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, OPEC+ is showing no signs of adjusting oil production when it meets next week, staying the course amid turbulence in financial markets, delegates said.</p>
      <p>Investors will also be watching comments from several US Federal Reserve officials, as well as a key measure of US inflation due this week, for clues on the path forward for monetary policy. Interest-rate hikes have added to bearish sentiment.</p>

	    <h3>In this article</h3>
	    <p>Investors are flocking to gold exchange-traded funds following weakness in the banking sector and a subsequent slump in confidence.</p>
	    <p>The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the largest gold ETF, has pulled in $489 million so far this year, etf.com data shows. That’s a reversal from the more than $1 billion in outflows the fund saw in the last quarter of 2022, the data shows. Meanwhile, the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) has hauled in $431 million during the same period.</p>	
    	<p>Last week, gold prices surged beyond $2,000 an ounce on rekindled fears of a banking crisis in the wake of the Credit Suisse takeover. That’s the first time bullion has traded above $2,000 since March 2022.</p>	
	    <p>Though spot gold prices eased slightly to $1,969 by Tuesday, they remain 7.7% higher than the $1,826 at which the metal started the year. Meanwhile, gold futures have inched up 7.6% year to date to $1,986.</p>
      <p>But that uptick in price and rush to gold ETFs may be due to a crisis of confidence, as recent tumult in the U.S. banking industry led to the collapse of several banks before spreading to Europe and rattling that continent’s financial sector, according to Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.</p>
      <p>“Gold can't go bankrupt,” Rhind said in an interview with etf.com. “People have always fled to gold in an environment where they don't have confidence in putting money in a bank account or buying bonds from either a government or from a corporation.”</p>
      <p>GLD has gained 7.3% year to date, according to etf.com data, while GLDM has jumped 7% as concerns over banking failures remain elevated. Deutsche Bank stock has sunk more than 22% in the past month on renewed market jitters.</p>
      <p>Also spurring the gold rally could be a weaker U.S. dollar and a prospective easing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve,” said Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion.</p>
      <p>“Gold and even silver are very sensitive to dollar strength or weakness; there's an inverse relationship between those two,” he added.</p>
      <p>“You've had a weaker dollar here, a little bit of a shift with the Fed in terms of maybe how aggressive they're going to be going forward. As a result, rates have started to drop,” Egilinsky explained, noting how the factors have given gold more traction.</p>

      <p>In this article:</p>
    	<p>When El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made the controversial decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country, many people were skeptical and concerned about the potential risks.</p>
    	<p>Bukele announced on Twitter that the country would purchase one Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) each day starting Nov. 18, 2022. How is that going in 2023? The latest news out of El Salvador suggests that the government's bet on cryptocurrency is paying off.</p>	
	    <p>According to Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya, the government has successfully repaid one of two outstanding $800 million bonds. This move is likely to allay concerns about a potential default, which had grown amid the country's adoption of Bitcoin.</p>	
	    <p>Zalaya announced the news via Twitter on Jan. 23, highlighting the government's commitment to meeting its debt obligations and proving the skeptics wrong. Bukele tweeted, “Well, we just paid in full 800 million dollars plus interest. But of course, almost no one is covering the story.”</p>
      <p>The government still owes $367 million plus interest on an additional bond set to mature in January 2025, but the successful repayment of the 2023 bond is a positive sign for the country's financial stability.</p>
      <p>What initially started as a largely controversial might be paying off as Bitcoin and many aspects of the blockchain-based asset market have began to rebound. Gamestop Corp.’s NFT marketplace has seen a considerable boom. Some of the top NFT projects on the platform have seen volume spikes as high as 21,446%.</p>
      <p>Similarly, leading NFT marketplace startup Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their active equity crowdfunding raise. This comes after their announcement of hitting $160 million in lifetime volume on the platform earlier this month and a host of other milestones.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin as Legal Tender</h3>
      <p>The small Central American country made headlines in 2021. The legislation required all businesses within the country to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services, granting it the same status as traditional fiat currencies.</p>
      <p>Chivo Wallet, the wallet created by the government of El Salvador, said 2.2 million Salvadorans were onboarded just one month after Bitcoin became the country’s legal tender. To encourage adoption, every user who successfully downloaded the app immediately received $30 in Bitcoin. By early 2022, about half of Salvadorans had downloaded the app.</p>
      <p>The “Bitcoin bet” has been met with mixed reactions from international organizations and governments, with many expressing their concerns about potential risks that may arise from the use of cryptocurrency. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued a statement on El Salvador's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, cautioning against potential risks associated with such adoption.</p>
      <p>Although there have not been any significant risks thus far following El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin, they noted it’s important for authorities to be vigilant when providing government exposure to digital assets. According to the statement, crypto markets are still largely speculative and unpredictable in nature and should be approached with caution for El Salvador’s economy to be safeguarded against potential losses.</p>
      <p>The IMF also highlighted the importance of transparency when dealing with cryptocurrency transactions and emphasized that it is crucial for regulators to ensure they remain compliant with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. It advised El Salvador to develop effective regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrency use.</p>
      <p>El Salvador appears undeterred by the IMF's recommendations. In January, its congress approved a digital securities law, paving the way for the country to raise funds through the issuance of the world's first sovereign blockchain bond. The law allows for the use of blockchain technology in the issuance, trading and clearing of securities, enabling greater efficiency and transparency in the process. The additional step forward for the country could potentially attract investment from tech-savvy investors looking for new opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
      <h3>El Salvadorian Prosperity in a time of uncertainty</h3>
      <p>While the U.S. market faces uncertainty around banking and a general decline in U.S. equities, El Salvador’s bet looks to be paying off. While El Salvador began buying Bitcoin at a significant premium to the current price, they also announced a purchase of 80 Bitcoin at a price around the $19,000 mark in July of 2022. They have also committed to purchasing one Bitcoin per day, every day since November of 2022. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was below $16,000. Roughly 126 days have passed since then meaning the company is still pouring millions into the digital currency despite the controversy, much of which has been at a steep discount to its current price of over $28,000.</p>

      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit against the US dollar during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see major resistance just above. After all, the market had formed a double top near the 1.24 level, and it looks as if there is significant resistance that could extend all the way to the 1.25 level.

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has rallied a bit against the US dollar during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see major resistance just above. After all, the market had formed a double top near the 1.24 level, and it looks as if there is significant resistance that could extend all the way to the 1.25 level. After all, the 1.25 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that has shown itself to be important in multiple times.</p>
	    <p>Underneath, we have the 200-Day EMA which sits just above the 1.21 level, which is also intertwined with the 50-Day EMA. That should offer a significant amount of support, so if we do break down from here, that might be the first area where you start to see buyers pushback. After that, we then have the 1.20 level, which has a significant amount of psychology attached to it, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. Underneath that level, then we look at the 1.1850 level, an area that has already shown itself to be important in a couple of times in the somewhat recent past.</p>	
	    <p>Looking at the longer-term chart, it seems as if we are trading between 1.24 on the upside and 1.1850 on the downside. Because of this, I’m looking for some type of exhaustion just above the start shorting again, but I do recognize that if we were to break above the 1.25 handle, then it’s very possible that we could go looking to the 1.2750 level above. After that, then we would go looking to the 1.30 level. If we do break above the 1.25 level, it’s very likely that we would see the US dollar falling against most major currencies in general, so it would be a market wide move.</p>	
	    <p>All things being equal, a lot of this will come down to risk appetite, as the US dollar is considered to be a safety currency. We have seen this move a couple of times recently, and each time there is selling pressure that enters the market. I suspect that we are going to see more of the same going into the short-term future.</p>

      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>Ahead of Tuesday's opening bell, Dow Jones futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value, and S&P 500 futures lost 0.2%. Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.2% in morning action.</p>

      <p>Monday's Big Picture column commented, "The Nasdaq and S&P 500 continue with a rally attempt that started about two weeks ago.

ALGN stock is looking for support around its 50-day moving average. If the stock breaches this level, then further weakness would be expected. ALGN stock was up 0.3% Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p><strong>Backstory:</strong>The company makes clear teeth-straightening systems called Invisalign. UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo says investors recently regained confidence in Align stock, which has surged 50% this year.

      <p>Backstory: Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over macroeconomic concerns, recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Palo Alto Networks continues to trade above and below its 192.94 buy point out of a cup with handle amid Monday's 0.5% move higher. The buy area will run up to 202.59 if the stock retakes the entry. PANW stock was unchanged premarket Tuesday.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, weekly China EV insurance registration data could be an important gauge for Tesla demand in the world's largest EV market, which is in the midst of a huge price war started by Tesla.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</h3>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares declined 1.2% Monday, ending a two-day win streak. Shares remain near their recent highs. AAPL stock moved down 0.4% Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares are again trying to capture a flat base's 276.86 buy point, but closed back below the entry during Monday's 1.5% loss. The stock is just below the 5% buy area that goes up to 290.70. And shares fell 0.2% early Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares surged earlier this month after the company announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications. That follows the company's investments in AI startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzy ChatGPT application.</p>

      <p>The British pound initially fell against the Japanese yen during early trading on Tuesday, as we continue to see a lot of choppy behavior in the Forex markets. It’s worth noting that the pair is highly sensitive to risk appetite, but more importantly is paying close attention to the Japanese bond markets as of late. Remember, the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy, meaning that they are trying to keep the 10 year yield down to 50 basis points or lower.

	    <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound initially fell against the Japanese yen during early trading on Tuesday, as we continue to see a lot of choppy behavior in the Forex markets. It’s worth noting that the pair is highly sensitive to risk appetite, but more importantly is paying close attention to the Japanese bond markets as of late. Remember, the Bank of Japan continues its yield curve control policy, meaning that they are trying to keep the 10 year yield down to 50 basis points or lower. Currently, they do not seem to have a lot of problems doing so, but every time interest rates around the world rise, it puts a bit of pressure on the Japanese yen as they will have to print more yen to buy more bonds.</p>
	    <p>On the other hand, the British have reiterated their need to fight inflation and not worry so much about the banking crisis. In other words, they are going to continue to be tight with monetary policy, and therefore it’s likely that the British pound will continue to be somewhat elevated. The 200-Day EMA sits just above, and of course will attract a certain amount of attention, but at the moment it seems as if the market is going back and forth in this range, as the moving averages are essentially flat, and therefore it suggests that we don’t have any conviction one way or the other.</p>	
	    <p>That being said, the market is likely that we go higher rather than lower, as long as the trendline stays intact. That’s all the way down at the ¥157.50 level, so we are a long way from breaking the trend in general. That being said, the market is likely to see a lot of noise above, so I think the market is going to be one that you have to look at through the prism of range bound trading, as there are a lot of questions as to what the economic health of the world is at the moment. The ¥165 level above looks to be like a hard ceiling also, so pay attention to that.</p>

	    <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we have seen resistance again at the 0.67 level, an area where we’ve seen a lot of action in the past. In fact, just a couple of trading sessions to go we ended up forming 2 shooting stars in a row, which is typically a very bearish sign. Ultimately, it’s also worth noting that the 50-Day EMA is just above and dropping. By doing so, this is a dynamic resistance barrier that continues to be paid close attention to. In other words, this is more or less going to be a “fade the rally” type of market.</p>
    	<p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to the commodity market, as Australia is a huge exporter of hard commodities such as copper, iron, and of course gold. With that in mind, it’s probably worth paying close attention to the idea that the commodity markets are highly influenced by the overall economic health of the world, with the demand for commodities being highly correlated. Furthermore, it also comes down to the health of the Chinese mainland, as Australia sends a majority of its exports to that part of the world.</p>	
    	<p>If we do break to the upside, it’s not until we clear the 0.68 level that I would be impressed with the move. In that scenario, we could see the market going toward the 0.69 level where would run into further resistance. On the other hand, if we turn around and break down from here, we could see the market reaching to the 0.66 level where there is a considerable amount of support. Anything below there then would open up a bit of a trapdoor, allowing the markets to flood to the downside. The overall attitude of the markets. The slowing of choppy confusion, and I think that will remain the same here in the AUD/USD pair, with more or less an eye on the downside more than up. Either way, I’m not expecting big moves in the short term, rather more or less a range bound scenario to continue.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market? You should consider the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/25/2000.</p>
	    <p>The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $15.23 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.</p>	
	    <h3>Why Large Cap Growth</h3>
      <p>Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.</p>	
	    <p>Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.</p>
      <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p>Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.</p>
      <p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.</p>
      <p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.09%.</p>
      <h3>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h3>
      <p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 44.70% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.</p>
      <p>Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 14.01% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN).</p>
      <p>The top 10 holdings account for about 49% of total assets under management.</p>
      <h3>Performance and Risk</h3>
      <p>SPYG seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization growth sector in the U.S. equity market.</p>
      <p>The ETF has gained about 6.29% so far this year and is down about -17.89% in the last one year (as of 03/28/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $49.14 and $68.01.</p>
      <p>The ETF has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 23.93% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 244 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p>
      <h3>Alternatives</h3>
      <p>SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SPYG is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.</p>
      <p>The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $78.01 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $168.40 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.</p>
      <h3>Bottom-Line</h3>
      <p>Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.</p>

	    <p>Bitcoin and Ether extended their declines in Tuesday afternoon trade in Asia, along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, after regulators in the U.S. pulled up Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, for allegedly violating trading mandates.

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were higher on Tuesday after the banking industry turmoil of the past few weeks but the rally seemed to be losing steam</p>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was near parity at 7,476 points during midday trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was also muted at 7,1080 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) was flat at 15,138.</p>	
	    <h3>Bank of England</h3>
      <p>Bank of England (BoE) governor Andrew Bailey said a wave of early retirements could force up inflation, leading to higher interest rates.</p>	
    	<p>Speaking at the London School of Economics on Monday evening, Bailey said that a sharp decline in the number of people in the workforce was “part of the reason why we have had to raise Bank Rate by as much as we have”.</p>
      <p>That trend, he warned, will drive up prices and mean borrowing costs may need to be higher.</p>
      <p>He said: “We should expect this to put upward pressure on inflation in a way that would call for a higher level of interest rates to dampen demand.”</p>
      <p>Bailey said the rise in inactivity of people aged 50 to 64 was “particularly striking”.</p>
      <p>Bailey said the BoE had not already decided that interest rates needed to increase further but noted that inflation of 10.4% in February was “much too high”. He stressed that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would assess the “emerging evidence” before opting to lift rates again.</p>
      <p>Last week, the BoE raised the Bank rate toto 4.25% — its highest level since 2008.</p>
      <p>The European Central Bank, US Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank have also all raised interest rates this month.</p>
      <p>Markets are also taking note of Bailey speaking at the Treasury Select committee about the Silicon Valley UK arm's collapse.</p>
      <p>The governor of the Bank of England has said that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the quickest seen since Barings Bank failed in 1995.</p>
      <p>Andrew Bailey told MPs that the UK subsidiary of the Californian lender experienced a 30% run on its deposits in a single day as panic spread through markets and savers.</p>
      <p>Despite the run, Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm as able to meet those requests, which made its sale process to HSBC (HSBA.L) easier.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Across the pond, S&P 500 futures (ES=F), Dow futures (YM=F) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) were all in the green ahead of the opening bell.</p>
      <p>Wall Street finished mixed on Monday, as bank stocks moved upward after North Carolina-based First Citizens (FCNCA) bank agreed to buy most of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.60% to close at 32,432 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.16% to finish at 3,977 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) lost 0.47% to 11,768.</p>
      <p>Banks will dominate the headlines again this week with the earnings and economic calendars in sight. The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on bank failures on Tuesday, with the witness list including FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg, Federal Reserve vice chairman Michael Barr, and Treasury undersecretary Nellie Liang.</p>
      <p>Barr wrote in a statement ahead of the hearing on Monday that the failure of SVB reeked of "mismanagement."</p>
      <p>"To begin, SVB's failure is a textbook case of mismanagement. The bank had a concentrated business model, serving the technology and venture capital sector," Barr's testimony reads.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) rose 0.15% to 27,518 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong climbed 1.10% to 19,782. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) lost ground, falling 0.18% to 3,245 points.</p>
      <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
      <p>Back in London, Ocado Group (OCDO.L) lost 4.39% after Ocado Retail, despite its joint venture with Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) reporting a rise in revenue.</p>
      <p>Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "A relief ripple is helping stocks make some gains amid hopes that the volatility, which has wracked the banking sector, has eased off.</p>
      <p>“Right now, worries about the impact of banking turmoil are taking a back seat and the Bank of England is intent on steering consumer prices lower. Governor Andrew Bailey stressed in his speech in London last night that interest rates may have to move higher if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressure.”</p>
      <p>Spirits maker Diageo (DGE.L) has appointed its first female chief executive after announcing the retirement of Sir Ivan Menezes after a decade in the top job.</p>
      <p>Debra Crew will step up from her current position as chief operating officer and lead the FTSE 100-listed business from 1 July.</p>
      <p>Across the wider FTSE 250 index (^FTMC), gambling company William Hill (888.L) has been hit by a record £19.2m ($23.6m) fine by the UK gambling regulator.</p>
      <p>Three gambling businesses owned by the company will pay the sum for "widespread and alarming" social responsibility and anti-money laundering failures, the Gambling Commission said.</p>
      <h3>Pound vs dollar</h3>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) gained ground against the dollar at over $1.23. Sterling (GBPEUR=X) rose nearly 0.15% against the euro, trading near €1.14.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) climbed and was trading at around $78 per barrel, with markets focused on developments in the banking crisis and indications of strengthening demand in China.</p>
      <p>"Though risks remain in the banking system amid the recent event, dip-buys in crude oil could be the prevailing trend in the near term," said Tina Teng, analyst at CMC Markets.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- In the battle for the biggest prize in China’s trillion-dollar pension market, BlackRock Inc. and other global firms have little chance of attracting clients like Judy Deng.</p>
	    <p>On New Year’s Eve, the logistics executive tapped on her phone to deposit 12,000 yuan ($1,700) into a new pension account at her local bank in Shanghai. Deng, 46, never considered investing with global asset managers.</p>	
	    <p>“You need a very strong reason to pick a foreign company,” she said, calling the global giants “very unfamiliar” names. “I don’t even know which country they’re from.”</p>	
	    <p>China launched private pension plans for the first time last year and Beijing has ensured that domestic banks and fund managers win the vast majority of the new business in a market that may eventually grow to $1.7 trillion. Global companies including BlackRock and Fidelity International Ltd have been off to a slow start.</p>
      <p>Given their tiny asset bases in China, most foreign money managers have so far been excluded from pilot trials in 36 cities, allowing banks like Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Merchants Bank Co. to grab all the inflows. To cement their lead, the banks are offering everything from cash incentives to free ibuprofen for each new account.</p>
      <p>“The first bite at the cake here won’t be easy” for foreign companies, said Zhou Yiqin, president of GuanShao Information Consulting Center, a financial regulations specialist.</p>
      <p>While it’s still early days for the new pension scheme, the head start for domestic companies illustrates the daunting challenges for global firms eyeing a piece of China’s $60 trillion financial services sector. From mergers advice to stock sales and trading, Wall Street is struggling in a market that combines endless potential with stiff local competition and regulatory roadblocks.</p>
      <p>China’s fledging private pension system is loaded with promise, as Beijing desperately tries to entice retirement savings to support an aging population. The number of people over 60 is expected to jump more than 50% by 2040, according to the World Health Organization. China’s population shrank last year for the first time in six decades.</p>
      <p>To address the problem, China has launched three pension pillars. The first two — a compulsory state-backed plan and a voluntary corporate matching option — don’t come close to meeting the future needs of most pensioners. Savings in the government-led program covering urban employees may run out by 2032 and face a shortfall of more than 7 trillion yuan by 2035, according to Citic Securities Co. estimates.</p>
      <p>The new private offering aims to fill the void, allowing clients to contribute up to 12,000 yuan a year in tax-sheltered plans, similar to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) in the US that have become a $13 trillion market. The private pillar is estimated by Citic to grow to 12 trillion yuan by 2035, equal to the two other plans combined. UBS Group AG estimates the market could be worth $25 trillion by 2060, more than a third of China’s gross domestic product by then.</p>
      <p>Competition among the 23 pilot banks that can open these accounts — all Chinese — is heating up. Some managers are dangling 50 yuan in digital envelopes — or hongbao — to win customers. Others offered ibuprofen, the Advil-brand fever medicine that was in short supply during the pandemic, while Postal Savings Bank of China Co. runs draws with a 600 yuan top prize.</p>
      <p>Read more: China’s Long-Delayed Plans to Hike Retirement Age Go Viral</p>
      <p>Deng is among 28 million residents — more than the population of Australia — who have opened new accounts as of March 2. The program attracted 14.2 billion yuan in the last two months of 2022 alone, according to official data.</p>
      <p>The new plan is an attractive niche for asset managers since the tax breaks appeal to high-income earners and the money will be locked up for years with the same firm. Once a client opens a pension account with a bank, they can only invest in eligible funds distributed by that lender. That’s a rare, government-sponsored opportunity in China, where fickle investors are notorious for switching investments and banks.</p>
      <p>“The quality of this cake is much better than that of the regular type,” said Sun Bo, head of pension investment at Beijing-based China Asset Management Co., controlled by Citic Securities.</p>
      <p>So far, most international firms’ wholly-owned businesses have been unable to join the pension party. They either lack sufficient assets to meet thresholds set by Beijing, or they’ve only recently won regulatory approval — often after lengthy delays — to buy out local partners to sell their own funds.</p>
      <p>BlackRock Moves</p>
      <p>BlackRock, with about 6 billion yuan in mutual fund assets, still hasn’t issued any products under the new program even though its wealth management joint venture was allowed to join given its experience with a previous trial. The New York-based giant attracted just 158 million yuan in the earlier push with partners China Construction Bank Corp. and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte.</p>
      <p>“If a ‘Big Brother’ like BlackRock can’t adapt well in China, it would serve as a mirror for other global managers to gauge their own prospects” for pension funds, Zhou said.</p>
      <p>BlackRock didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>BlackRock, Defying Soros Warning, Breaks New Ground in China</p>
      <p>Other money managers such as Fidelity and Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which gained approvals for stand-alone units last year, are just starting to build onshore assets to meet the minimum thresholds.</p>
      <p>Fidelity is scheduled to start its first product early next month, while Neuberger Berman just raised 4.1 billion yuan in its maiden fund.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have been in China for decades but only won approval in recent months to buy out their partners and ramp up their independent operation. JPMorgan has two funds in the trial via its joint venture.</p>
      <p>“The pension market is one of the biggest opportunities for our onshore business, considering China’s demographic change and tremendous need for retirement investments,” JPMorgan said in a statement to Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</p>
      <p>For the new entrants, meeting the thresholds may take time. Only retirement-target products with at least 50 million yuan in average assets over the past four quarters — or at least 200 million yuan in the recent quarter — can qualify. To start selling retirement-target funds, the firms need to be in operation for at least two years, and run a mutual fund business of at least 20 billion yuan.</p>
      <p>These thresholds may be relaxed over time to entice more foreign players, UBS analyst Cao Haifeng told reporters in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>“If they get to participate in the domestic market, with investors warming up to their products, that should help facilitate China’s capital market development,” Cao said. “It’s going to be a win-win.”</p>
      <p>In the meantime, firms such as Credit Suisse Group AG and Schroders Plc are getting some pension revenue from their minority stakes in joint ventures though that’s not as lucrative as wholly-owned businesses like BlackRock’s that can pitch their own funds.</p>
      <p>Read more: China Moves a Step Closer to a National Pension System</p>
      <p>Winning over Chinese consumers won’t be easy as local banks tend to favor their in-house funds over rival products, Zhou said. Deng chose her lender — Bank of Shanghai — because a relative who works there needed to fill his quota. She even won a 50 yuan prize.</p>
      <p>Invesco Ltd.’s fund venture shut down one of its retirement-target funds after its assets dropped below a minimum 200 million yuan threshold following losses last year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s first wealth management product — not in the pension space — raised just $21 million, a fraction of the industry average.</p>
      <p>Global firms “must move faster” if they want a bigger share of the market, said Sun at ChinaAMC. While foreign players are often better at product design and asset allocation, they lack brand recognition and need to understand the bank-dominated distribution network, he said.</p>
      <p>The slow rollout could test global managers’ commitment to China as they face years of losses before building up scale, and it’s unlikely any foreign commercial bank will be selected for the trial, according to Zhou at GuanShao. He cited Citigroup Inc., which announced in December it will wind down its consumer bank in China as part of a wider retreat. Vanguard Group Inc. scrapped plans in 2021 to set up a wholly-owned fund business and now plans to exit the country entirely, people familiar told Bloomberg News.</p>
      <p>Read more: Vanguard Said to Shutter Business in China, Exit Ant Venture</p>
      <p>Still, global players have plenty of time to catch up in a market that will take years to develop, said Harry Handley, a senior associate at Z-Ben Advisors Ltd., an asset management research firm in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>“It was highly unlikely that foreign firms would be welcomed into the market from the very beginning and few are in a position to execute on the opportunity,” he said.</p>
      <p>Even with the slow start, Wall Street firms appear committed to the pension space in the world’s second-largest economy. Fidelity says pensions are “in their DNA” and are an integral part of their China focus.</p>
      <p>“In due course, leveraging Fidelity’s extensive experiences in managing pension investments for clients around the world, we aim to offer pension solutions to Chinese investors to enhance their retirement readiness,” the company said in an emailed statement.</p>

      <p>Strange because almost all other weekends in the month were filled with evident price rises. Despite the market sluggishness, Decentraland [MANA] jumped to the top of the most discussed out of the thousands of crypto projects.</p>
	    <h3>Opium in the virtual land</h3>
	    <p>According to Santiment, MANA’s social dominance rose sharply on 26 March. At press time, Ethereum [ETH] virtual world project maintained the hike at 0.354%.</p>
    	<p>This increase implied that the Decentraland community actively participated in conversations around the token. And the depth of discussion was far above many others.</p>	
    	<p>However, the rise in social activity is not an inescapable condition for a positive price action or perception. This was further revealed by the weighted sentiment. The sentiment takes into account the unique social volume and measures the average subjective information about an asset.</p>	
    	<p>At the time of writing, MANA’s weighted sentiment was -0.388. This means that the impression that investors had towards the token was not necessarily optimistic. The MANA price decreased 1.74% in the last 24 hours, following a similar trend as most cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>Regardless, it did not seem that the token would go for a trend reversal anytime soon, as indicated by the Awesome Oscillator (AO). Based on the daily chart, the AO was -0.0161, at press time.</p>
      <p>This value suggested that the momentum was bearish. However, there was potential for a trend reversal with the emerging presence of green bars.</p>
      <p>In terms of volatility, the Bollinger Bands (BB) showed that MANA was contracting. And with the price evading both the upper and lower band, it meant that the token was not oversold or overbought, at the time of publication.</p>
      <h3>No accolades yet</h3>
      <p>Furthermore, the number of active addresses on the Decentrand network had significantly reduced. Active addresses show the number of unique participants that had successful transactions within a network.</p>
      <p>According to Glassnode, the last time MANA had a notable hike in this regard was 17 January. But at press time, these addresses were down to 729.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Decentrland has been somewhat quiet in this first quarter as there has been no notable development. Since this was the case, it is likely that MANA’s price action only responds to widespread crypto trends.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) — On the surface, Charles Schwab Corp. being swept up in the worst US banking crisis since 2008 makes little sense.</p>
	    <p>The firm, a half-century mainstay in the brokerage industry, isn’t overexposed to crypto like Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, nor to startups and venture capital, which felled Silicon Valley Bank. Fewer than 20% of Schwab’s depositors exceed the FDIC’s $250,000 insurance cap, compared with about 90% at SVB. And with 34 million accounts, a phalanx of financial advisers and more than $7 trillion of assets across all of its businesses, it towers over regional institutions.</p>	
	    <p>Yet the questions around Schwab won’t go away.</p>	
	    <p>Rather, as the crisis drags on, investors are starting to unearth risks that have been hiding in plain sight. Unrealized losses on the Westlake, Texas-based firm’s balance sheet, loaded with long-dated bonds, ballooned to more than $29 billion last year. At the same time, higher interest rates are encouraging customers to move their cash out of certain accounts that underpin Schwab’s business and bolster its bottom line.</p>
      <p>It’s another indication that the Federal Reserve’s rapid policy tightening caught the financial world flat-footed after decades of declining rates. Schwab shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since March 8, with some Wall Street analysts expecting earnings to suffer.</p>
      <p>“In hindsight, they arguably could have had more prudent investment choices,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Wong.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger and the brokerage’s founder and namesake, billionaire Charles Schwab, have said the firm is healthy and prepared to withstand the broader turmoil.</p>
      <p>The business is “misunderstood,” and it’s “misleading” to focus on paper losses, which the company may never have to incur, they said last week in a statement.</p>
      <p>“There would be a sufficient amount of liquidity right there to cover if 100% of our bank’s deposits ran off,” Bettinger told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday, adding that the firm could borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank and issue certificates of deposit to address any funding shortfall.</p>
      <p>Through a representative, Bettinger declined to comment for this story. A Schwab spokesperson declined to comment beyond the Thursday statement.</p>
      <p>The broader crisis showed signs of easing on Monday, after First Citizens BancShares Inc. agreed to buy SVB, buoying shares of financial firms including Schwab, which was up 3.1% at 2:29 p.m. in New York. The stock is still down 42% from its peak in February 2022, a month before the Fed started raising interest rates.</p>
      <p>Unusual Operation</p>
      <p>Schwab is unusual among peers. It operates one of the largest US banks, grafted on to the biggest publicly traded brokerage. Both divisions are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations.</p>
      <p>Like SVB, Schwab gobbled up longer-dated bonds at low yields in 2020 and 2021. That meant paper losses mounted in a short period as the Fed began boosting rates to stamp out inflation.</p>
      <p>Three years ago, Schwab’s main bank had no unrealized losses on long-term debt that it planned to hold until maturity. By last March, the firm had more than $5 billion of such paper losses — a figure that climbed to more than $13 billion at year-end.</p>
      <p>It shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities from “available-for-sale” to “held-to-maturity” on its balance sheet last year, a move that effectively shields those unrealized losses from impacting stockholder equity.</p>
      <p>“They basically saw higher interest rates coming,” Stephen Ryan, an accounting professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said in a phone interview. “They didn’t know how long they would last or how big they would be, but they protected the equity by making the transfer.”</p>
      <p>The rules governing such balance sheet moves are stringent. It means Schwab plans to hold more than $150 billion worth of debt to maturity with a weighted-average yield of 1.74%. The lion’s share of the securities — $114 billion at the end of 2022 — won’t mature for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield now: 3.5%.</p>
      <p>Cash Business</p>
      <p>Schwab’s other headache from higher interest rates stems from cash.</p>
      <p>At the root of Schwab’s income is idle client money. The firm “sweeps” cash deposits from brokerage accounts to its bank, where it can reinvest in higher-yielding products. The difference between what Schwab earns and what it pays out in interest to customers is its net interest income, among the most important metrics for a bank.</p>
      <p>Net interest income accounted for 51% of Schwab’s total net revenue last year.</p>
      <p>“Schwab’s counting on inertia,” said Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic, a financial-planning firm.</p>
      <p>After a year of rapidly rising rates, there’s greater incentive to avoid being stagnant with cash. While many money-market funds are paying more than 4% interest, Schwab’s sweep accounts offer just 0.45%.</p>
      <p>Though it’s an open question just how much money customers could move away from its sweep vehicles, Schwab’s management acknowledged this behavior picked up last year.</p>
      <p>“As a result of rapidly increasing short-term interest rates in 2022, the company saw an increase in the pace at which clients moved certain cash balances” into higher-yielding alternatives, Schwab said in its annual report. “As these outflows have continued, they have outpaced excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and pay-downs on our investment portfolios.”</p>
      <p>In their statement, Bettinger and Schwab wrote that “client deposits may move, but they are not leaving the firm.”</p>
      <p>FHLB Borrowing</p>
      <p>To plug the gap, the brokerage’s banking units borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report filed with regulators.</p>
      <p>Schwab borrowed an additional $13 billion from the FHLB so far this year, the filing showed.</p>
      <p>Analysts have been weighing these factors, with Barclays Plc and Morningstar lowering their price targets for Schwab shares in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Bettinger and Schwab said that the firm’s long history and conservatism will help customers navigate the current cycle, as they have for more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>“We remain confident in our client-centric approach, the performance of our business, and the long-term stability of our company,” they wrote in last week’s statement. “We are different than other banks.”</p>

U.S. investors saw some relief after North Carolina-based First Citizens BancShares bought all the loans of failed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
	    <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin rose 1.01% to US$27,806 in the 24 hours to 4:00 p.m. in Hong Kong. The world’s first cryptocurrency hovered around US$28,000 for most of last week, amid looming concerns of a potential banking crisis.</li>
        <li>Ether fell 0.12% to US$1,752 in the same timeframe, making for a weekly drop of 2.48%.</li>
        <li>Bitcoin saw the day’s biggest gains, followed by Binance’s BNB token that rose 0.62% to change hands at US$326.24. Cardano’s ADA saw the biggest drop, as it fell 1.81% to US$0.35.</li>
        <li>The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by 0.32% to US$1.16 trillion in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, with total crypto market trading volume up by 6.93% to US$33.32 billion.</li>
        <li>The Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.49% to 4,021.44 points, losing 2.68% during the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.</li>
        <li>U.S. investor concerns over a banking crisis partially eased after First Citizens BancShares, the parent company of First Citizens Bank, bought all the loans and deposits of failed Silicon Valley Bank, resulting in a 0.56% gain for the S&P 500.</li>
        <li>Asian equities were mixed on Monday, after the IMF’s managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned on Sunday that financial stability risks have increased after a banking sector crisis in the U.S. and Europe earlier this month. Georgieva also said that global growth would slow to just 3% this year due to war in Ukraine, Covid-19 related restrictions and monetary policy tightening to tackle sticky inflation.</li>
        <li>The Shanghai Composite slid 0.44% while the Shenzhen Component Index inched up 0.12%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.33% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.75%.</li>
        <li>European bourses saw a rebound after a steep sell-off last week, led by gains in the banking sector. The benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.97% and Germany’s DAX 40 gained 1.11%.</li>
        <li>Gold fell 0.45% to US$1,968 an ounce on Monday, after testing the US$2,000 mark multiple times last week. The U.S. dollar is struggling to recover from a seven-week low, after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard clarified last Friday that the U.S. central bank is planning further monetary tightening.</li>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade is upon us and for the first time, individuals who have “staked” their ETH as part of the network’s security mechanism will be able to withdraw their holdings. Will this create huge sell pressure for the second-largest cryptocurrency? Hardly.</p>
	    <p>After the Shanghai upgrade (or “hard fork”), users who had locked a minimum of 32 ETH to secure an APY staking reward of 4-5% will be able to withdraw a portion of their stake immediately. But those wishing to withdraw their entire stake will need to wait one to 36 days, which dampens potential sell pressure. Furthermore, only 16% of ETH stakers are in profit, so why would they sell now?</p>	
	    <p>In fact, for rational investors, selling ETH now would likely make little sense. And the investor profile for ETH holders leans towards rationality and a long-term outlook. It’s arguably one of the world’s premier risk assets, and the only reasons investors are still on the sidelines may be because they don’t understand it, they fear its ferocious volatility, or they find the regulatory uncertainty to be unnerving.</p>	
	    <p>But the answer to the first objection also answers the second, and will go a long way toward answering the final objection. By the end, you may grok the thesis that Ether — in the crypto vernacular — isn’t just “sound money” it’s “ultrasound money.”</p>
      <p>Ethereum is a blockchain that sells block space to apps. The apps must pay for transactions using the blockchain’s native currency: ETH.</p>
      <p>The demand side of the trade relies on simple network effects, the more apps, the more users, the more demand for ETH. And this is because the Ethereum network is the oldest and most established decentralized smart contract ecosystem out there.</p>
      <p>Ethereum and Bitcoin networks were analyzed by researcher Ken Alabi in a 2017 paper. “The analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by Metcalfe’s Law, which identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes, or end users.” This means that adoption can increase the value of any given network exponentially.</p>
      <p>On the supply side, ETH is issued as compensation to independent actors who run network nodes, and this currently amounts to 671,000 ETH per year. However, thanks to a novel burn mechanism that destroys a small amount of ETH per transaction (by sending it to a wallet from which it can never be withdrawn), the supply of ETH is actually shrinking despite token issuance.</p>
      <p>Ultrasound.money is a dashboard that tracks the burn rate in real-time showing that the supply of ETH has been shrinking for months — and that’s in the middle of a raging bear market, imagine what would happen when demand picks up again. In fact, despite the bear market, transactions on Ethereum are still maintaining a solid uptrend thanks to innovations like NFTs and decentralized finance.</p>
      <p>Volatility should be ironed out slowly as the effects of network adoption take place. The more people who join the Ethereum network, the more the value of ETH increases, which leads to more adoption. As the market cap increases it will take larger and larger market movements to rock the boat, reducing the large deviations in the price.</p>
      <p>The best that crypto-bashing regulators can hope for is to slow down the pace of adoption. But there’s not much incentive for most governments to support this approach because a) crypto, on the retail side, is driven by Millennials and Generation Z, so it will be a voter issue in the coming years, and b) it will only move innovation offshore.</p>
      <p>Even as the U.S. is putting a squeeze on crypto, Dubai, Hong Kong and the U.K. are already preparing to scoop up exiled crypto companies. And even if regulators shoehorn ETH into the antiquated category of a security — so what? Anyone could buy securities in minutes using an app on a phone.</p>
      <p>The upcoming Shanghai upgrade will be followed by a more complex upgrade that will reduce fees on the Ethereum network, making it faster and even more user-friendly. The genie is well and truly out of the bottle, and investors may well find a magic carpet beckoning.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>y00ts announced it will migrate to Polygon on 27 March 2023.</li>
        <li>A day remains until the zkEVM release but MATIC continues to suffer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Polygon [MATIC] recently witnessed a major boom in its NFT ecosystem, suggesting growth. Santiment’s chart showed that Polygon’s total NFT trade count and trade volume in USD increased considerably since 16 March 2023.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the increase in trade counts, the number of unique addresses holding NFTs have also increased.</p>
	    <h3>What can fuel further growth?</h3>
	    <p>Things might get even better in the coming days as y00ts, one of the most popular NFT collections on Solana [SOL], announced that it will migrate to Polygon on 27 March.</p>
	    <p>As per the announcement, users will be able to directly migrate from y00ts website. Not only can holders simply migrate, but they will also be rewarded for the same. In fact, holders will be rewarded with $5 USDC per y00t listed on Magic Eden.</p>	
	    <p>Additionally, the official tweet mentioned that y00ts is disapproving of further development for y00ts/DeGods on SOL.</p>	
	    <p>The reason why this can help Polygon is that for the next 30 days, there will be no trading fees for y00ts on Magic Eden. Therefore, holders and new users can be motivated to buy or sell more, helping Polygon’s NFT ecosystem grow further.</p>
      <h3>Polygon is all set for the zkEVM launch</h3>
      <p>While y00ts will migrate to Polygon, the blockchain will be launching its much-awaited zkEVM. As the network prepares for the launch, it has started a bug bounty program.</p>
      <p>The bounty program, which will be run by Immunefi, is one of the many safeguards in place for the upcoming release of mainnet beta.</p>
      <p>This program will further help Polygon in refining its product. Well, its competitor, Ethereum’s [ETH] layer-2 solution, zkSync Era, was fully opened to the public on 25 March 2023.</p>
      <p>Beating Polygon, the zkSync Era became the first EVM with the support of zero-knowledge rollup (zk-rollup) to be launched on the mainnet.</p>
      <h3>MATIC performance was not at par</h3>
      <p>While the NFT ecosystem witnessed growth, the same was not true for MATIC, which has fallen victim to the bears. According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC’s price declined by over 8% in the last week. At press time, it was trading at $1.09 with a market capitalization of over $9.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Due to the decline, MATIC’s MVRV ratio plummeted sharply. The hype around the zkEVM launch also was not enough to give investors confidence as MATIC’s weighted sentiment remained on the negative side.</p>
      <p>The future of MATIC post-zkEVM launch remains to be seen.</p>

        <li>Gas spent and the daily wallets with 1+ LINK were on a declining trend, at press time. </li>

      </ul>
      <p>Chainlink [LINK] has been witnessing a constant decline in its number of holders lately. Dune’s data revealed that the daily number of wallets with 1+ LINK has been on a declining trend for months. </p>
      <p>And as per Market.link, gas spent on the chain has also gone down, suggesting less usage of the Chainlink network. </p>
	    <h3>Can LINK regain users? </h3>
	    <p>While the number of users on the network declined, whales still preferred LINK over the rest of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
	    <p>Consider this- LINK recently flipped Shiba Inu [SHIB] to become the most traded token among the top 500 Ethereum [ETH] whales.</p>	
	    <p>Additionally, LINK has also been stepping up its efforts to increase adoption, which can play a role in attracting new users to the network.</p>	
	    <p>One of the latest ones was the integration with SteakHut, which has equipped Chainlink Automation to support automated liquidity management.</p>
      <p>The official announcement mentioned that SteakHut decided to use Chainlink Automation to monitor the state of smart contracts and perform advanced liquidity management on-chain because it is the most reliable Web3 automation service. </p>
      <p>As per Santiment, LINK’s network growth remained relatively high, indicating that a larger number of new accounts were used to transfer the token. The velocity also followed a similar trend, which too suggested high network activity.</p>
      <p>However, negative sentiments around LINK were dominant in the market. Well, this can cause trouble for LINK since investors’ faith seems to be dwindling. </p>
      <h3>LINK is feeling the heat</h3>    
      <p>Though there were signs of recovery on the network front, LINK’s price action aligned with the sellers’ interests. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of LINK dropped by more than 3% in the last 24 hours, and it was trading at $7.13, at the time of writing.</p> 
      <p>Nonetheless, much like network activity, LINK’s on-chain metrics gave hope for better days.</p>
      <p>For instance, LINK’s supply on exchanges declined while its supply outside of exchanges went up.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, LINK’s demand in the derivatives market also remained high, as suggested by its Binance funding rate. This might help LINK change its price trajectory in the coming days.</p>
      <h3>More selling pressure soon? </h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, LINK’s daily chart revealed that the sellers might soon increase their pressure. At press time, LINK’s Money Flow Index (MFI) was in the overbought zone. In fact, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also registered a downtick, which was a development in the bear’s favor.</p>
      <p>However, its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon displayed a slight bullish crossover. The MACD supported EMA readings.</p>
      <p>However, the entry of selling forces in the near term can’t be ruled out. </p>

	    <p>In 2022, the FTX crash sent shockwaves through the crypto world, causing many holders to question the safety of keeping their assets on exchanges.</p>
	    <p>The incident sparked a renewed interest in self-custody to secure crypto holdings. However, while Ethereum experienced a decrease in exchange balances in the months following the crash, this trend can be attributed to other factors beyond fear of exchange insecurity.</p>	
	    <h3>Ethereum exchange netflow flashes negative</h3>
      <p>According to a recent Glassnode chart from Glassnode alerts, the balance of Ethereum held on exchanges has been steadily decreasing.</p>	
	    <p>As of this writing, the exchange balance had reached a five-year low, hovering just above $18 million. This trend indicates that more ETH holders are opting for alternative storage methods rather than leaving their assets on exchanges.</p>
      <p>In addition, a closer examination of Ethereum’s exchange netflow reveals that the outflow of ETH from exchanges has exceeded the inflow, with few exceptions of inflow spikes.</p>
      <p>Currently, the netflow of ETH on exchanges remains negative, with outflow continuing to dominate. At the time of writing, the netflow had surpassed 11,000 ETH already, highlighting the ongoing trend of ETH holders moving their assets away from exchanges.</p>
      <h3>Possible reasons for declining exchange balance</h3>
      <p>One possible factor is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms built on the Ethereum network. Many holders have moved their funds from centralized exchanges to DeFi protocols to earn higher yields.</p>
      <p>The yields come through liquidity provision, staking, or other forms of participation in decentralized finance. Also, ETH stakes account for 15% of the coins in circulation per staking rewards.</p>
      <p>It is also possible that some holders took a more long-term investment approach by holding their assets in personal wallets. It is a means of storing value and avoiding short-term trading risks.</p>
      <p>Also, the crypto market experienced a downturn in the latter half of 2022. The downturn may have led some holders to move their assets off exchanges and into personal wallets.</p>
      <h3>Daily timeframe move and 365-day MVRV</h3>
      <p>Despite experiencing a decent price run, Ethereum (ETH) had yet to regain the price zone it dropped back in May. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,740 and had sustained losses for two consecutive days. However, ETH had maintained a support level of around $1,732 and $1,630, previously resistance levels. </p>
      <p>The 365-day Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) revealed that for most of the period being analyzed, ETH was trading below zero.</p>
      <p>However, as of this writing, the MVRV had surpassed the zero line and currently sat at 13.60%. This indicated that, on average, the holders of ETH were now profitable, given the price at which they acquired their coins.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin experienced a net outflow in the last three days; short positions may not be a good idea.</li>
        <li>Bitcoin whales demonstrate mixed reactions that explain the current stalemate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the last few days, we have seen Bitcoin [BTC] struggle to sustain its upside. Now the market is showing some bullish weakness and the bears are trying to take advantage. The next few days might bring forth a significant pullback and here’s why.</p>
      <p>Recent data suggests that Bitcoin’s failure to continue rallying past the $28,300 resistance level yielded a loss of confidence among investors. The situation was further exasperated by miner outflows which are currently at a monthly high according to the latest glassnode data.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin miner outflows are often considered a confidence indicator. This is because miners often hold on to their BTC when there are bullish expectations and sell when there are bearish expectations.</p>
      <p>It is thus not surprising that they are offloading some BTC, right after Bitcoin struggled to push beyond its current resistance level.</p>
      <h3>Will Bitcoin outflows lend favor to the bears?</h3>
    	<p>The Bitcoin miner observations also align with BTC’s -$119 million net flows in the last 24 hours according to glassnode alerts. This is slightly lower than the -$190.5 million net flow on 24 March and even lower than the -$342 million net flow on 23 March.</p>
    	<p>It is important to note that the net flows confirm that sell pressure has also been slowing down. In other words, Bitcoin might not necessarily be in for a strong bearish pullback this week contrary to expectations. This will, however, depend on the possibility of market events that may swiftly change the outcome.</p>	
    	<p>The lower net flows may explain why short sellers may not necessarily be keen on executing leveraged positions. Bitcoin’s estimated leverage ratio is currently down to its lowest level since the start of 2023. Meanwhile, funding rates have leveled out for the most part.</p>	
    	<p>The lack of confidence among short sellers and leverage traders reflects mixed observations with Bitcoin’s supply distribution. For example, addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC have been buying in the last three days, hence providing a cushion for the price. The same whale category currently controls 12.13% of the circulating supply.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have been selling in the last three days. The same addresses currently control 23% of the total BTC supply, hence their impact is more pronounced.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Polkadot was the blockchain network with the highest development activity in the last 30 days.</li>
        <li>DOT traded within a narrow range in the last week as investors remain unsure of the coin’s next direction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Layer 0 blockchain Polkadot [DOT] has emerged as the leading blockchain network in terms of development activity in the last 30 days, new data from Santiment revealed. </p>
      <p>According to the on-chain data provider, Polkadot GitHub commits during the period under review totaled 591.47, tying with Kusama. The Ethereum [ETH] network, on the other hand, logged a development activity count of 387.67, putting it four places behind Polkadot.</p>
      <p>Development activity is an important metric as it offers insights into a crypto project’s commitment to creating a working product and the likelihood of shipping new features. In addition, a high development activity often reduces the possibility of the project being an exit scam.</p>
      <h3>DOT wading through troubled waters</h3>
	    <p>Despite sharing a statistically significant positive correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], whose value jumped by 13% in the last 30 days, DOT’s value decreased by 17% during the same period. </p>
	    <p>The drop in DOT’s value occurred despite the optimistic sentiment that lingered in the cryptocurrency market and investors’ increased accumulation in the face of uncertain macro factors. </p>	
	    <p>According to data from CoinMarketCap, the altcoin exchanged hands at $6.04 at press time.</p>	
      <p>The decline in value is partly attributable to the fall in the token’s Open Interests since 17 February. According to Coinglass, DOT’s Open Interest has since fallen by 25%.</p>
      <p>When a crypto asset’s Open Interest falls, it indicates reduced trading activity, as investors may be closing their positions or taking profits. </p>
      <h3>Up or down, who knows?</h3>
	    <p>An assessment of DOT’s movement on a daily chart revealed severe price volatility in the first 19 days of March. However, in the last week, investors appeared to have stayed their hands as many remain unsure of the coin’s next direction. </p>
      <p>Since 20 March, DOT’s price was at the middle line of the Bollinger Bands indicator, and remained so at press time. When the asset’s price is on the middle line of the Bollinger Bands, it indicates that the asset’s price is in a neutral position, and there is no clear trend in either direction. It is generally considered a “wait-and-see” situation for traders and investors until there is a clearer signal of where the asset’s price is heading.</p>
      <p>While DOT’s price oscillated within a narrow range in the last week, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) embarked on an uptrend. This suggested that some buying activity was underway despite the decline in RSI.</p>
      <p>However, the neutral price action indicates that the market remains uncertain about the asset’s direction.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The chain ID of the Shibarium testnet was a source of significant FUD.</li>
        <li>Daily transactions on the test network zoomed to 718 on 24 March.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The FUD which gripped the Shiba Inu [SHIB] ecosystem since the testnet launch of layer-2 blockchain Shibarium, could soon be a thing of the past.</p>
	    <p>According to the latest update provided by a SHIB influencer, the chain ID of the Shibarium testnet, also called ‘Puppynet’, has been changed. As per a screenshot posted in the same thread, the new chain ID was 719.</p>
      <h3>Basis of the FUD</h3>
	    <p>The chain ID of the Shibarium testnet became a bone of contention as soon as it was launched. A Shiba Inu discord channel member pointed out that Shibarium’s chain ID shared the same ID as the Rinia testnet blockchain.</p>
	    <p>The member insinuated that Shibarium might have copied the genesis file from the Rinia testnet and changed their name to Shibarium without changing the chain ID.</p>	
	    <p>While Shibarium developers termed this as a coincidence, the revelation caused much furor in the SHIB community and the price of SHIB fell by more than 8%.</p>	
	    <p>However, after the announcement of a new chain ID, the FUD might subside. And there were strong positive signs coming from Puppyscan, the Puppynet explorer. The daily transactions on the network zoomed to 718 on 24 March, after staying lulled for the last few days.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Shibarium team was also working on the faucet update. Faucets are used to obtain the test cryptocurrency needed to interact with the testnet blockchain. The Shibarium faucet will utilize a BONE token in order to allow users and developers to perform tests on the network.</p>
      <h3>Whales are back in business?</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, SHIB exchanged hands at $0.00001055 at the time of writing, falling by 1.21% over the previous day, per CoinMarketCap.</p>
      <p>With clarity on chain ID in place, big addresses were attracted to SHIB. As per Santiment, the supply held by large addresses as a percentage of the total supply increased over the last two days.</p>
      <p>This could be due to whales amassing SHIB in large quantities as the number of transactions transferring more than $1 million rose.</p>
      <p>However, despite the increase in transaction numbers, data from Shibburn revealed that the burn rate declined by over 92% in the last 24 hours, with a little over 1.34 million tokens removed from circulation.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Despite the re-emergence of interest in profile picture NFTs  (PFPs) since the beginning of the year, Solana [SOL] has witnessed a steady decline in NFT activity. </p>
      <p>According to data from Dune Analytics, the network has seen a steep decline in its count of monthly NFT trades completed since September 2022. With 349,937 NFT trades completed on Solana this month, there has been a 63% drop from the 944,010 total NFT trades completed in January. </p>
      <p>As a result of a consistent fall in NFT trade count on Solana since the year started, the network has also experienced a drop in sales volume. With a sales volume of $35.35 million recorded so far this month, Solana has witnessed a 64% decrease from the $99.37 million registered as total NFT sales volume in January. In the last month alone, this fell by 22%. </p>
      <h3>Solana marketplaces are the biggest losers</h3>
      <p>Due to a decline in NFT activity on Solana, the NFT marketplaces native to the chain have faced a persistent fall in sales volume, buyer and seller count, and revenue. </p>
      <p>Formfunction, a Solana-based NFT marketplace, recently announced its decision to stop operating after only 13 months of operation due to a decline in Solana NFT prices and trading volumes. </p>

      <p>Likewise, the number of active traders using the marketplace has also trended downward since the year started. Per data from Dune Analytics, this has since fallen by 31%.</p>
      <h3>SOL amid all this</h3>
    	<p>Thanks to the rally in the general cryptocurrency market since the year began, SOL’s value has surged by 105% on a year-to-date basis. At press time, the altcoin exchanged hands at $20.54 per SOL, data from CoinMarketCap revealed. </p>
	    <p>With increased coin accumulation in the last week, SOL buyers were spotted in control of the market on a daily chart at press time.</p>

        <li>The total stablecoin market cap of Tron grew by 5% over the last week.</li>
        <li>The TVL on the network dropped 3% since the SEC launched a probe against the TRON foundation.</li>
      </u>
      <p>The TRON [TRX] ecosystem shared a report on the network’s notable developments that took place over the week that went by.</p>
	    <p>One of the major takeaways was the network’s increasing dominance in the stablecoin sector.  Tether [USDT], the largest stablecoin by market cap, saw its circulating supply on Tron reach a record high. At press time, it was over 44 billion, as per Tronscan.</p>
	    <p>Additional data from DeFiLlama revealed that the total stablecoin market cap on the network grew by 5% over the last week to $43.57 billion.</p>
      <p>This was in stark contrast to the chain with the highest stablecoin market cap, Ethereum [ETH], which registered a weekly drop of 2.3%.</p>
      <h3>Network expands thanks to stablecoins</h3>
      <p>Tron became a go-to platform for stablecoins ever since the USD Coin [USDC] depegging episode which rattled the broader crypto market. In fact, a day after the fateful event, the stablecoin inflows into the network reached a three-month high of $1.17 billion.</p>
      <p>The remarkable growth prompted Tron founder, Justin Sun, to announce an ambitious plan of growing the stablecoin market cap to $60 billion.</p>
      <p>It became evident that stablecoin-dominated trading powered the whole network. Since the stablecoin turmoil, the revenue generated on the chain surged 70% until 24 March while the daily user base expanded by 21%.</p>
      <p>The growth in revenue propelled Tron as the second-best performing chain over the last week.</p>
      <h3>Next challenge for TRX</h3>
      <p>On the flip side, the total funds deposited on the network’s smart contracts fell significantly, sparking liquidity concerns. Since March 2022, the total value locked (TVL) dropped 3% until press time, as per DeFiLlama.</p>
      <p>Notably, this happened after the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) initiated a probe against the Tron foundation and Justin Sun over charges of unregistered sale of TRX and BTT which the regulator termed as securities.</p>
      <p>Following this, TRX’s price tumbled 13%. However, the coin recovered to its press time value of $0.06375, per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, according to Tronscan, more than 18 million TRX tokens were moved out of circulation in the last 24 hours. Adjusted against newly minted tokens, there was a net decrease in the circulating supply of TRX  by 13.4 million.</p>

      <p>Cosmos [ATOM] has depreciated by over 15%, clearing gains from the recovery in mid-March. ATOM dropped from $13.5 and was operating at the $11 price level at the time of writing. A retest of a crucial support level could offer new buying opportunities at discounted prices.</p>
	    <p>At press time, Bitcoin’s [BTC] value was below $28K and could further exert selling pressure on ATOM to retest this key support level.</p>

      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-212-01jpg.png" alt="ncx-blogs"/>
      <p>After facing price rejection at $15.5 in January, ATOM has weathered selling pressure that has seen it drop to $10.58. Bulls successfully recovered from the $10.58, but the second leg of the rally was interrupted by the obstacle at $13.5.</p>	
	    <p>ATOM’s retracement could set it to retest the $10.58 support, and a rebound could be likely if the bulls defend it. A pullback retest on the support could offer long positions targeting 50 EMA, 200 EMA, or $13.5.</p>	
	    <p>A close above $13.5 could usher ATOM into the second leg of the rally with a target of $15.5 if the bulls clear the $14.77 hurdle.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, ATOM could depreciate further to $9.57 if bulls fail to defend the $10.58 support. As such, the downswing could offer short-sellers extra shorting opportunities at $9.57 if ATOM closes below $10.58.</p>
      <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retreated from the upper ranges and fluctuated below the 50 mark, showing buying pressure declined. Similarly, the Average Directional Index (ADX) dropped, suggesting a likely further retracement or consolidation.</p>
      <h3>Funding rate was negative: development activity improved</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-212-02.png" alt="ncx-blogs"/>
      <p>According to Santiment, funding rates flashed red at press time – an indication of bearish sentiment in the derivatives market. Moreover, the weighted sentiment had dropped significantly but remained positive, which could give bulls little hope.</p>
      <p>Development activity has declined since mid-March but showed signs of improvement at press time. The trend could bolster investors’ confidence and prop up ATOM’s value in the long run. Investors should track BTC’s performance to make better moves.</p>

      <p>Cardano’s [ADA] recovery continues to face challenges but has clawed back some of the gains lost after retracement from mid-February. At press time, ADA hit a price ceiling of $0.3876, and bears seemed determined to sink to key support at $0.3578.</p>
      <p>So far, the $0.3578 has prevented a dip plunge twice, giving a reprieve to bulls. The support could be steady if BTC maintains a hold on $28K. However, bulls’ efforts could be complicated if BTC drops below $28K.</p>
	    <h3>Will the $0.3578 support hold?</h3>
	    <p>The retracement from mid-February saw ADA depreciate by 28%, dropping to $0.30. But the low price saw increased demand, tipping bulls for a recovery. Price action oscillated between $0.3236 – $0.3578 before breaking above the range after BTC zoomed to the $28K area.</p>
	    <p>Bears could sink ADA to retest the $0.3578 support. But a close below the support could attract a more aggressive price dump that could push ADA towards the lower support at $0.3236, especially if BTC drops below $28K.</p>	
	    <p>But bulls could gain leverage if ADA closes above the price range upper level of $0.3876. Such an upswing could push the price toward $0.4056 or the overhead resistance level of $0.4201.</p>	
	    <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) faced rejection below the 60-mark and moved sideways after retreating from the oversold zone. It shows buying pressure eased. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) moved south, showing bears had more influence in the market.</p>
      <h3>CVD slope turned negative</h3>
      <p>According to Coinalyze, the aggregated CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) slope turned negative and moved downwards, indicating that sellers were more dominant in the market at press time. Therefore a retest of the $0.3578 was highly likely, and a breach below could occur if BTC falls below $28K.</p>
      <p>However, more short positions ($445K) have been liquidated in the past 24 hours compared to long positions ($345K). It shows an underlying bullish sentiment which could offer bulls hopes of a possible rebound at $0.3578. But investors should track BTC’s price movements for more profitable moves.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tether expects its Q1 earnings at roughly $700 million.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Tether has expressed optimism about its profits in Q1, especially now that March is approaching its conclusion. The demand for USDT surged in during the quarterly period for numerous reasons but the road ahead might have some bumps.</p>
      <p>According to the latest reports, Tether expects more than $1 billion in total revenue from USDT in Q1. It also anticipates a $700 million profit for the quarter.</p>
	    <p>The first three months of March have so far been quite eventful for USDT and the rest of the stablecoin segment following USDC’s depegging.</p>
	    <p>USDT saw a large influx of volumes especially as many people migrated from USDC. This new volume added to Tether’s transaction revenue generated from USDT transactions.</p>	
	    <p>Tether also increased USDT supply in Q1 and continues to increase it further, according to recent data. There was roughly $77.6.14 billion worth of the stablecoin in circulation on Thursday according to the latest Glassnode data.</p>	
	    <p>But can this surge in circulating supply match the prevailing stablecoin demand? A comparison between active addresses and transfer volumes may provide some interesting insights.</p>
      <p>Active addresses peaked in mid-February, during which there was a surge in daily transfer volume. This is likely because of the outflows as the market saw ample demand.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the USDT transfer volume had its highest peak on 11 March. This was mainly because of the aforementioned inflows due to USDC migration.</p>
      <p>However, transfer volume dropped since then due to outflows as demand for cryptocurrencies surged.</p>
      <h3>U.S. regulator finds inroad to criticize stablecoins</h3>
      <p>USDT’s growing circulation might be in preparation for more demand but it has not been without concerns.</p>
      <p>Many crypto proponents have expressed concerns regarding Tether’s ability to provide a proper guarantee of reserves. The SEC recently took advantage of those concerns to launch criticism against Tether and USDT.</p>
      <p>In fact, the SEC described proof of reserves as meaningless in a recent statement to investors. The latter constitutes the latest of the market’s concerns.</p>
      <p>Regulators have been increasingly pushing back against cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. However, some view this as a good sign that regulators are concerned about the crypto market appearing as a threat to the traditional finance system.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the current market views, there are still concerns about potential bank runs that may trigger the loss of stablecoin pegs in the future.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>MATIC transaction surged considerably, and accumulation also increased. </li>
        <li>NFT space witnessed decline and market indicators were bearish. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Polygon [MATIC] witnessed a massive surge in transactions as the metric crossed $40 million in value on 24 March. MATIC was the only top-10 crypto that registered these numbers. Apart from Polygon, Fetch [FET], and The Sandbox [SAND] registered similar growth. </p>
      <p>It was also interesting to note that MATIC accumulation by whales was on a rise. Santiment’s chart revealed that MATIC’s supply held by top addresses went up over the last week, reflecting the investors’ confidence in the token. </p>
      <h3>Polygon gains in popularity</h3>
	    <p>Not only did whales accumulate more MATIC, growth was also noted on other fronts. For instance, Dune’s chart indicated that MATIC’s unique users were on an increasing trend, indicating more usage and adoption of the network.</p>
	    <p>Though there were several reasons for this growth, one of them can be attributed to the recent partnership of MATIC with Immutable, a leading Web3 gaming platform.</p>	
	    <h3>A quick overview of Polygon’s NFT space</h3>
      <p>While the number of unique addresses was rising, a decline was registered in NFT sales. According to CRYPTOSLAM’s chart, MATIC’s NFT sales volume declined by over 38% in the last seven days. Not only that, but after spiking during late February 2023, MATIC weekly volume on Polygon marketplaces declined sharply.</p>	
	    <p>Despite the decline in the NFT ecosystem, Polygon Daily, a popular Twitter handle that posts updates about the network’s development, tweeted about the most traded NFT collection on OpenSea. As per the tweet, CollectTrumpCards once again topped the list, followed by The Sandbox and Lens Protocol.</p>
      <h3>Other metrics looked decent</h3>
      <p>Things were looking pretty good for MATIC in terms of its on-chain performance. For instance, MATIC’s exchange reserve decreased, suggesting less selling pressure. The token’s supply outside of exchanges also increased, which is a typical bull signal.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the massive surge in transactions, MATIC’s network growth remained high last week, indicating that more new addresses were used to transfer MATIC. Additionally, more tokens were transferred among multiple addresses, which was evident from looking at MATIC’s spiking velocity on 21 March.</p>
      <h3>A bear takeover?</h3>
      <p>Though the metrics were fine, MATIC’s price action turned bearish lately. As per CoinMarketCap, the token’s price declined by over 1.8% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1.11 with a market capitalization of more than $9.6 billion. Polygon’s daily chart also gave a bearish notion and suggested a further price decline.</p>
      <p>The MACD displayed the possibility of a bearish crossover. MATIC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered a slight decline, which was bearish. The Bollinger Band’s findings indicated that MATIC’s price was in a less volatile zone, further decreasing the chances of a northbound breakout in the near term.</p>
      <p>However, the token’s Money Flow Index (MFI) remained bullish, as it was moving above the neutral mark. Combining that with the upcoming zkEVM launch, the possibility of a trend reversal can’t be ruled out.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Aptos revealed its next growth plan involving NFTs and the music industry.</li>
        <li>APT struggled to maintain bullish momentum as sell pressure slowly trickled back.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Aptos [APT] network is tapping into the latest hype around its platform to pursue more growth opportunities. Two of its latest announcements reveal that the network is eyeing growth opportunities in the music industry as well as pushing deeper into the NFT market.</p>
	    <p>Aptos recently affirmed its plans to play an active role in the music industry and potentially even revolutionize it. The network aims to achieve this by bringing WEB3 benefits to the music industry through KYD apps.</p>
	    <p>Aptos is likely going to leverage its NFT capabilities as part of its plans for the music industry. The network also conveniently launched OrderDAO, its new community governance protocol for NFT projects. The protocol will make it easier for projects to make efficient decentralized decisions regarding their future.</p>
	    <h3>Can these announcements breathe new life into APT?</h3>
      <p>Aptos’ native cryptocurrency APT struggled to find directional performance this week after its rally last week. This suggests that the bulls ran out of momentum. Meanwhile, the bears have been pushing to take over. APT tanked by 6.8% to its $12.20 press time price.</p>	
	    <p>There are other reasons for investors to expect sell pressure to prevail. For example, APT’s RSI attempted to push below the 50% level. The price also encountered resistance above the $13.7 price range and it has been struggling to rally above its 50-day moving average.</p>	
	    <p>Numerous Aptos metrics show a higher potential for a pivot. For example, APT’s price volatility has been declining and is currently at a weekly low. In addition, the price experienced a sizable drop in volume between 23 – 24 March, confirmation that the bulls were losing strength.</p>
      <p>APT’s weighted sentiment dropped slightly in the last 24 hours at press time, confirming that some investors were losing faith in the bulls. However, its press time level was notably higher than its weekly low on 20 March.</p>
      <p>Aptos’ social dominance metric had its highest weekly spike in the last 24 hours. This was an important observation, as it may indicate that APT investors were aware of the bulls’ sluggishness.</p>
      <p>They may thus act in accordance with the current observations, potentially contributing to more sell pressure. Of course, this will depend on the overall market direction, which may regain its upside unexpectedly.</p>

    description: <div className="blog-desc">
      <p>The Total Value Locked of Aave [AAVE] gained as much as 8.69% in the week ended 25 March. The rise in unique smart contract deposits made the protocol the best-performing one as the overall TVL hit $5o.01 billion — a Year-To-Date (YTD) high.

      <ul>
        <li>Aave recorded the most asset deposits in its protocol.</li>
        <li>Though Lido underperformed, its TVL hit 2023 highs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Total Value Locked of Aave [AAVE] gained as much as 8.69% in the week ended 25 March. The rise in unique smart contract deposits made the protocol the best-performing one as the overall TVL hit $5o.01 billion — a Year-To-Date (YTD) high. However, the TVL fell to $49.42 billion at press time</p>
	    <p>The TVL considers factors like the circulating supply, asset locked, as well as user interest in a protocol to measure the protocol’s health. So, Aave’s hike implied that many participants in the last seven days looked in the lending and borrowing direction.</p>
      <h3>Aave takes the week and triumphs</h3>
	    <p>Lido Finance [LDO] dominated the space for several weeks before Aave took over. Although the liquid staking protocol maintained its stay as the project with the highest TVL, it did not perform well enough to place second-fiddle to Aave. According to DeFi Llama, Lido’s performance over the week yielded a less than 1% hike.</p>	
	    <p>However, this does not take away Lido’s position as the project which has accommodated the most staked Ether [stETH] ready to be unlocked on 12 April when the Ethereum’s [ETH] Shanghai upgrade takes place. </p>	
	    <p>Aave, on the other hand, may not boast of such, but its rise in popularity could also be due to Ethereum’s impact. With a $4.82 billion lifetime contribution, Ethereum has helped Aave record a substantial number in fees and revenue.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the non-custodial liquidity protocols have not experienced significant strides regarding developments. As of 23 March, development activity reached a yearly low of 3.792.</p>
      <p>A detailed understanding of the metric points to feature upgrades, and public commitment by the project’s developers to improve products under the blockchain.</p>
      <p>But at press time, there has been some recovery as the metric improved to 4.31. This implies that the developers’ activity contribution has been notably restored.</p>
      <h3>NFT volume rises as…</h3>
      <p>In addition to the TVL increase, NFT sales on the Aave network were also impressive over the week. According to Santiment, the digital collectibles volume reached $16.05 million on 20 March. Although it was reduced afterwards, most of the daily sales surpassed those of the previous week.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Aave’s activities during the week included playing its part in returning funds to those affected by the Platypus exploit. The exploit happened in February when a flashloan drained the Avalanche [AVAX]-based protocol of $9 million.</p>
      <p>Although it threatened the project’s solvency, Aave’s governance was able to help out as the rightful owners got back their funds.</p>

        <li>The blockchain developer share in the U.S. fell from 40% in 2017 to 29% in 2022.</li>
        <li>Emerging markets like India were capturing the share away from the U.S.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As per an analysis by Developer Report, the U.S. ceded a considerable chunk of the blockchain development pie to emerging markets around the world.</p>
      <p>The report highlighted that developer share in the U.S. fell from 40% in 2017 to 29% in 2022, corresponding to about 2% drop every year.</p>
      <p>The ongoing crackdown by regulators on centralized exchanges and other crypto participants has left the U.S. crypto sector in a state of trepidation, threatening the market dominance that the country has enjoyed over the last few years.</p>
      <h3>India, Ukraine show consistent web3 growth</h3>
	    <p>The overall growth in development activity was encouraging, even as the crypto network value dropped to January 2018 levels, the report underlined. The number of developers jumped almost by four times during the same time period.</p>
	    <p>U.S. was still the market leader at the time of writing, accounting for 29% of all blockchain developers. European nations also enjoyed a combined market share of 29% while Asia was home to 13% of all web3 developers.</p>	
	    <p>But while U.S.’ share has declined over the years, emerging markets like India saw their developer share steadily increasing from 2% in 2017 to 6% in 2022. India’s growth trajectory showed more consistency as compared to other regions, the report stated.</p>	
	    <p>India’s lucrativeness as a growing market for blockchain development was evidenced by the data showing how the country was eating into the share of the U.S.</p>
      <p>Data from Europe also revealed an interesting development. While UK and Germany lead in developer share, both countries saw their dominance decline in the 2017-2022 period. Conversely, conflict-ridden Ukraine’s share increased from 4% to 6% since the war.</p>
      <h3>Will it only get worse?</h3>
      <p>Recently there were reports that Coinbase was contemplating setting up a trading platform outside the U.S. While Coinbase didn’t make any official statement, the report had weight owing to concerns of an enforcement action on the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, said in an interview that the crypto industry has already moved overseas and the hawkish stances of the SEC may dent the prospects of U.S. as an inviting destination for blockchain development and cryptos.</p>

      <p>The Nasdaq Composite losing a third of its value is the perfect excuse for opportunistic investors to pounce on high-quality growth stocks.</p>
      <p>As much as we'd like the stock market to move higher and never falter, it's important to recognize that corrections, crashes, and bear markets are a normal part of the long-term investing cycle. Last year, all three of the major U.S. stock indexes plunged into a bear market, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) getting hit hardest -- a 33% decline when the finish line was crossed.</p>
      <p>While bear markets can be unpleasant in the short run and tug on investors' heartstrings, they're also, historically, the ideal time for patient investors to pounce. Even though we can't consistently forecast when a bear market will begin, how long it'll last, or how steep the decline will be, we do know that all previous bear markets have eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally. In other words, bear market volatility is a red-carpet invitation for opportunistic investors.</p>
      <p>With growth stocks taking it on the chin, they're a logical place for long-term investors to look for bargains. What follows are five jaw-dropping growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
      <h3>CrowdStrike Holdings</h3>
      <p>The first awe-inspiring growth stock that's ripe for the picking during the Nasdaq bear market decline is end-user cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -2.23%). Though recessionary fears have weighed on CrowdStrike in the short run, it's well positioned with clear-cut competitive advantages over the long term.</p>
      <p>On a macro basis, investors should be aware that cybersecurity solutions have evolved into basic necessity services. Hackers and robots don't take vacation days just because the U.S. economy hits a speed bump. Businesses of all sizes with an online and/or cloud-based presence are increasingly relying on third-party providers like CrowdStrike to protect their sensitive data.</p>
      <p>The engine that powers CrowdStrike's incredible growth is Falcon, the company's cloud-native platform that's reliant on artificial intelligence (AI). Falcon is overseeing trillions of weekly events, which is helping it become smarter at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time. Despite CrowdStrike's services being costlier than its peers', the company's gross retention rate of 98% speaks volumes about Falcon's efficacy.</p>
      <p>Although CrowdStrike hasn't had any trouble gaining new subscribers, the most intriguing aspect of its ascension is the add-on sales from existing clients. Six years ago, a single-digit percentage of its 450 clients had purchased four or more cloud-module subscriptions. Today, 62% of its more than 23,000 subs have purchased five or more cloud-module subscriptions. These add-on sales are the key reason CrowdStrike's subscription gross margin is near 80%.</p>
      <h3>Fiverr International</h3>
      <p>A second stellar growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (FVRR -0.38%). Despite near-term worries of a possible U.S. recession weakening the labor market, Fiverr has three key catalysts it brings to the table.</p>
      <p>To start with, the labor market has been permanently shifted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some people have returned to the office, more are choosing to work remotely than ever before. This means Fiverr's freelancer marketplace is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this structural change in the workforce.</p>
      <p>Another reason Fiverr stands out is the way its freelancers market their work. Whereas pricing tasks on an hourly basis is commonplace at competing online-service marketplaces, Fiverr freelancers price their work as a package. The price transparency of Fiverr's platform is helping to push both spend per buyer and the aggregate number of buyers higher.</p>
      <p>The third differentiating factor is Fiverr's take-rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform that it gets to keep. Most competing freelancer marketplaces keep around 15% of the revenue tied to negotiated deals. Fiverr's take-rate continues to climb and hit 30.2% during the fourth quarter.  Fiverr isn't scaring away buyers or freelancers, and a 30%-plus take-rate shows it'll be substantially more profitable than its peers.</p>
      <h3>Intuitive Surgical</h3>
      <p>The third jaw-dropping growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying on the Nasdaq bear market plunge is robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 4.89%). Though COVID-19 has caused some optional surgical procedures to be pushed to a later date, Intuitive Surgical's dominance of the robotic-assisted surgical landscape, along with its operating model, sets this company up for long-term success.</p>
      <p>As of the end of 2022, Intuitive Surgical had installed 7,544 of its da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals and surgical centers worldwide.  While this might sound like a pedestrian figure, it's far more than its competitors. For a two-decade stretch, da Vinci was one of the only soft-tissue assistive surgical systems available.</p>
      <p>What's more, it takes a considerable amount of time to train surgeons to use da Vinci, and it's pricey to purchase these systems -- $500,000 to $2,500,000 per system. The tangible expense and opportunity cost associated with purchasing a da Vinci surgical system makes it highly unlikely that hospitals or surgical centers will switch to a competing device.</p>
      <p>However, the real lure is Intuitive Surgical's razor-and-blades operating model. The company's da Vinci operating system may be pricey, but it's intricate to build and generates only mediocre margins. But once Intuitive has clients locked into its surgical system, it generates copious amounts of high-margin revenue by selling instruments with each procedure and servicing its systems. As time passes, these higher-margin sales channels are becoming a larger percentage of total revenue.</p>
      <h3>Fastly</h3>
      <p>A fourth marvelous growth stock you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq bear market swoon is edge computing company Fastly (FSLY 0.56%). In spite of ongoing losses, new leadership appears to have Fastly on the fast track to sustained double-digit sales growth and eventual profits.</p>
      <p>Fastly is best known for its work as a content-delivery network. It's tasked with getting data from the edge of the cloud to end users as quickly and securely as possible. Both the rise of the metaverse and the hybrid work environment in the wake of the pandemic are catalysts that can increase the amount of data traversing Fastly's network. Since this is a usage-based network, more data movement equates to more revenue for Fastly.</p>
      <p>Although its growth rate has slowed a bit, the vast majority of Fastly's key performance metrics remain rock solid. Its total customer count has grown by 500 over a seven-quarter stretch (21 months, ended Dec. 31, 2022), with average enterprise customer spend (over the last 12 months) increasing by 11% to $782 over that same span. More importantly, Fastly's dollar-based net expansion rate (DBNER) is climbing, once again, and hit 123% during the fourth quarter. A DBNER of 123% implies that existing clients spent 23% more during the fourth quarter than they did in the comparable quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Lastly, new CEO Todd Nightingale should inspire confidence in shareholders. Nightingale was hired to tighten the belt at money-losing Fastly, further innovation, and keep the customer count needle moving in the right direction.  Nightingale is, thus far, firing on all cylinders in his young tenure.</p>
      <h3>Baidu</h3>
      <p>The fifth jaw-dropping growth stock you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip is China's leading internet search provider Baidu (BIDU 3.55%). Though multiple headwinds have held Baidu back for the past three years, many of these hurdles have now been lifted.</p>
      <p>For example, China's zero-COVID mitigation strategy resulted in unpredictable and stringent lockdowns that crippled supply chains for most sectors and industries. With China removing its stringent COVID-19 restrictions, the country's economy is free to thrive once again. Though it could take a few quarters for China's residents to build up immunity to COVID-19, moving beyond the zero-COVID strategy will benefit the country and Baidu.</p>
      <p>What makes Baidu such a phenomenal stock to buy is its dominance of the Chinese internet search space. As of February, it accounted for approximately 56% of all search share in its home market. This makes it the go-to choice for advertisers wanting to target their message(s) and logically gives the company strong ad-pricing power.</p>
	    <p>But don't overlook AI as a major future growth driver for Baidu. In addition to the company's recently released AI-powered chatbot, known as Ernie Bot, Baidu AI cloud services and AI-based intelligent driving solutions are delivering double-digit sales growth in the company's nonmarketing sales channel. </p>
    	<p>With economic activity in China ramping back up, Baidu stock remains reasonably cheap at 13 times Wall Street's forward-year consensus earnings.</p>

      <p>A big drop in demand for diesel fuel may be due to slowing economic growth in the U.S., especially in the heavy industry and construction sectors.</p>
	    <p>Diesel prices at the pump have fallen to their lowest in over a year. That’s good news for consumers, but the decline in prices for the fuel suggests a gloomy outlook when it comes to the U.S. economy.</p>
	    <p>“Diesel fuel is ubiquitous in our economy,” says Brian Milne, product manager, editor, and analyst at DTN. It’s a “critical component in industrial production and…supply-chain dynamics.”</p>

	    <p>Halliburton and Honeywell in advanced talks to develop oil fields and refineries in Libya; Eni importing more oil and gas from Algeria</p>
	    <p>CAIRO—After years of underinvestment in North Africa’s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows.</p>	
	    <p>Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals.</p>	
	    <p>Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy’s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria.</p>
      <p>Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt.</p>
      <p>“North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,” said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy, “this is their moment,” he said.</p>
      <p>Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region’s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say.</p>
      <p>At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food. The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices.</p>
      <p>“I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,” NOC’s Mr. Bengdara said.</p>
      <p>The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.</p>
      <p>Halliburton and Total didn’t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Libya’s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant.</p>
      <p>Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports.</p>
      <p>As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country’s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021.</p>
      <p>Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias.</p>
      <p>The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia’s paramilitary Wagner Group, the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country’s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya, is aligned with the government in Tripoli.</p>
      <p>“There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,” said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as “an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.”</p>
      <p>NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion.</p>
      <p>In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country’s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026.</p>
      <p>In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm’s top region for investment in the next four years.</p>
      <p>“Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,” said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January.</p>
      <p>From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year.</p>
      <p>Egypt’s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn’t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance’s Ines Ferre joins the Live show to discuss the dip in oil prices after the U.S. signaled it will wait before refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).</p>
	    <p>JARED BLIKRE: Energy markets dipping on worries about an oversupply, especially after the US signaled it will wait before refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The SPR weakness there contributing to the overall gloom in the markets. Here with more is Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines.</p>
	    <p>INES FERRE: Yeah, Jared, and this lower oil prices, it's really having an impact on energy as a whole, energy stocks, equities as well. Let's take a look at our YFi Interactive board so we can see where the underlying commodity crude oil is right now. You're looking at WTI that is down more than 1 and 1/2%. You've got crude right now that is on pace for its biggest first quarter drop since 2020. That's when the pandemic hit, and you saw demand being wiped out. This week, we had a little bit of a rebound when it came to oil, but today, we are seeing losses, taking out a big chunk of the gains that we had seen this week.</p>	
	    <p>Also, Brent crude down 1.8%. Remember that last week, you had oil that, on a weekly basis last week, lost almost 10% of its value. A lot of this has to do with a stronger dollar, which is impacting the price of oil because oil is invoiced in dollars. You've got the US now that is holding off on refilling its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as you just mentioned, Jared. Also, you have Russian oil that is still coming into the market, despite the Western sanctions. And then you've got concerns about a US recession, and the banking concerns, the banking worries deepening worries of a recession. You've got institutions that are selling their oil futures.</p>	
	    <p>Now, we have been seeing Wall Street sort of pulling back a little bit on their forecast when it comes to crude oil for the end of the year, but not as much as you would think. I mean, one of the commentaries that I saw out there is that this isn't necessarily like 2008, where oil touched a low of $39 a barrel. Analysts aren't seeing oil going that much lower. But nonetheless, we are seeing a selloff when it comes to oil recently.</p>
      <p>And then just taking a look at other commodities, look, if you are a gold bug, you are happy this week because gold touched $2,000 an ounce. I've spoken to analysts saying, this is it for gold, guys. The gold is coming out-- is breaking out from here. We'll see, but certainly, one analyst telling me, 2024, that's going to be huge for gold. Guys.</p>

	    <p>In this article, we take a look at 15 largest oil fields in the world. If you want to see more largest oil fields in the world, go directly to 5 Largest Oil Fields in the World.</p>
	    <p>Oil fields are areas where there is substantial oil in multiple oil reservoirs that are trapped by impermeable rock above. In oil reservoirs, oil exists as tiny droplets inside open spaces called pores inside rocks. Given the pressure that exists deep beneath the surface, oil can squeeze through tiny pores of underground rock. Furthermore, given the earth's natural heat deep below ground in some fields, oil also wants to squeeze to the areas above.</p>	
	    <p>The Department of Energy describes the process, "Oil in a reservoir acts something like the air in a balloon. The pressure comes from millions of tons of rock lying on the oil and from the earth’s natural heat that builds up in an oil reservoir and expands any gases that may be in the rock. The result is that when an oil well strikes an underground oil reservoir, the natural pressure is released—like the air escaping from a balloon. The pressure forces the oil through the rock and up the well to the surface."</p>	
	    <p>Some oil fields are offshore while others are onshore. Many oil fields also produce natural gas, although the total mix of oil and gas can vary substantially from oil field to oil field. Depending on their location and geology, the cost to extract oil from oil fields can vary as well. For those of you interested, check out 15 Countries That Produce the Most Oil in the World.</p>
      <p>Many of the world's largest oil fields are in the Middle East as several countries in the region have substantial reserves of oil. Many of the world's most economical to extract oil fields are also in the Middle East given the region's favorable geology.</p>
      <p>Because they have operational expertise and capital, big oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) sometimes help nations develop some of their oil fields. In addition to extracting oil from oil fields, oil companies also have to transport the oil often through pipeline to export facilities or to refineries that do further processing.</p>
      <p><strong>The World's Largest Oil Fields</strong></p>
      <p>In terms of the world's largest oil fields, some of the largest oil fields have already produced a lot of oil like China's Daqing Field which began full scale production in 1963. Meanwhile others like Kazakhstan's Kashagan Field are relatively new.</p>
      <p>Given their size and the importance of oil, some of the world's largest oil fields are also important to the global economy. The world's largest oil field, Saudi Arabia's Ghawar Field, for instance, produces around 4 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for well over 1/3 of Saudi Arabia's total production. Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of oil in the world, with crude oil exports of 7.28 million barrels per day in November of 2022.

      <p><strong>Crude Oil</strong></p>
      <p>In terms of crude oil, the price of the commodity has fallen recently as economists worry of an economic slowdown as a result of the recent Silicon Valley Bank failure. If oil prices decline, companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) might not be as profitable as they could have been.</p>
      <p>In the longer term, the world will need to reduce its dependence on crude oil as a transportation fuel to reduce carbon emissions. In the near and medium terms, however, the world is expected to continue to need crude oil for transportation and for many refined crude products.</p>
      <p>In terms of oil prices, it isn't clear where they will go as many factors can influence the oil price.</p>
      <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
      <p>For our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World, we used Stacker's Largest oil fields in the world list and data from Stacker. Given the company's calculations, it isn't clear whether the data is barrels of oil or barrels of oil equivalent, which could include natural gas.</p>
      <p>Stacker includes cumulative past production in its oil field size data. Because some mega oil fields have already produced much of their oil, they don't have as much future production capability but nevertheless still rank on our list.</p>
      <p>We ranked the oil fields based on the total reserves based on cumulative past and future production potential.</p>
      <h3><strong>15 Largest Oil Fields in the World</strong></h3>
      <h3>15. Marun Field</h3>
      <p><strong>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 22 billion barrels</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Country: Iran</strong></p>
      <p>Iran was the eighth largest producer of oil in 2021 with production of 3.6 million barrels per day in the year. As the country's second largest producing oil field, Marun Field is one reason why. Discovered in 1963, the oil field produced around 1 million barrels per day at its peak in the 1970's and the field still produces around 600,000 barrels of oil per day according to a Bloomberg article in 2020.</p>
      <h3>14. Samotlor Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 25 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Russia</strong></p>
      <p>Russia is an energy superpower with substantial oil and gas reserves. As far as oil fields go, Samotlor Field is the country's largest oil field with 25 billion barrels of cumulative past production and future production potential. Like Marun Field, Samotlor Field is an oil field that has already produced a lot of oil. At its peak, the field produced around 3 million barrels per day in the 1980's.</p>
      <h3>13. Prudhoe Bay</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 25 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: United States</strong></p>
      <p>Prudhoe Bay is America's largest oil field in terms of total oil reserves when including cumulative past oil production. The Alaskan oil field has been active for over four decades and still has over 800 active wells. Although production in Prudhoe Bay is declining and well below its peak in the 1980's, U.S. oil production has nevertheless increased over the years, ranking the country #1 in the world in terms of oil production in 2021 with 16.59 million barrels per day produced in 2021.</p>
      <h3>12. Tengiz Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 26 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Kazakhstan</strong></p>
      <p>Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field ranks #12 on our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World given its total oil reserves of 26 billion barrels based on past and future production. Tengiz Field is the country's highest oil producing field with official capacity of 600,000 barrels per day as of 2022. With a planned expansion, however, the oil field could have oil production capacity of 850,000 barrels per day by 2024.</p>
      <h3>11. Kashagan Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 30 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Kazakhstan</strong></p>
      <p>Kashagan Field is another giant oil field in Kazakhstan with substantial oil reserves. According to estimates, the Kashagan Field could have 30 billion barrels of oil reserves when including cumulative past production, ranking it among the largest in the world. As a country, Kazakhstan had total oil production of around 1.6 million barrels per day in 2022 and S&P Global Platts Analytics expects Kazakhstan's oil output to reach 2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 2.6 million barrels per day by 2030.</p>
      <h3>10. Aghajari Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 30.2 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Iran</strong></p>
      <p>Aghajari Field in Iran is one of the oldest big oil fields in the world given it was first discovered in 1938. Although it has total oil reserves based on cumulative past production and future production potential of 30.2 billion barrels, much of the oil in Aghajari Field has already been produced.</p>
      <h3>9. Bolivar Coastal Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 32 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Venezuela</strong></p>
      <p>Venezuela's Bolivar Coastal Field is the country's largest oil field and also one of the oldest given it was discovered in 1917. According to Stacker, Bolivar Coastal Field has total oil reserves based on cumulative past production and future production potential of 32 billion barrels.</p>
      <h3>8. Cantarell Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 35 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Mexico</strong></p>
      <p>Cantarell Field is comprised of four fields that was first discovered in 1972. Given the oil field has already produced a lot of oil, production in Cantarell Field is declining and the oil field was surpassed in 2009 as the biggest oil field in Mexico in terms of production.</p>
      <h3>7. Safaniya Oil Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 37 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: Saudi Arabia</strong></p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia's Safaniya Oil Field is one of the two largest offshore oil fields in the world along with UAE's Upper Zakum Oil Field. According to Reuters, Safaniya Oil Field had production capacity of over 1 million barrels per day in 2019 and mainly produces heavy oil. It ranks #7 on our list of 15 Largest Oil Fields in the World given its total oil reserves of 37 billion barrels when including cumulative past production.</p>
      <h3>6. Daqing Field</h3>
      <p>Total Oil Reserves Based on Cumulative Past Production and Future Production Potential: 42 billion barrels</p>
      <p><strong>Country: China</strong></p>
      <p>Daqing Field is China's largest oil field that still produces around a third of the country's total oil despite entering full scale production in 1963. Given its growing large economy and insufficient domestic oil production, China is the world's largest importer of oil and production from Daqing Field helps reduce imports.

      <p>The Dow Jones dropped 300 points Friday on renewed banking fears. Deutsche Bank dived 10% as the bank's credit default swaps surged.</p>
	    <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dropped 300 points Friday on renewed banking fears. U.S. shares of Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) plunged more than 10% after concerned investors drove the bank's credit default swaps, which insure against bond failure, to a four-year high. The panic sent investors fleeing into bonds, driving yields lower. Meanwhile, energy stocks crowded the bottom of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 as oil prices swooned.</p>
	    <p>Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 1.4% while Citigroup (C) declined 1.8%. And Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 1.7%. The SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) dropped 2.1%, with First Republic Bank (FRC) down more than 4%. (For our latest coverage of the market's action, go to our Stock Market Today page.)</p>	
	    <p>On the economic front, February durable goods orders from the Commerce Department fell 1% for the month. Wall Street saw durable goods orders rising 1.5% for the month vs. January's 4.5% drop. Further, the S&P Global's preliminary Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing and Services Indexes for March came out.</p>	
	    <p>The manufacturing index posted a better-than-expected 49.3 reading vs. the 47.2 estimates, while the services index measured 53.8, higher than the 50.3 estimate.</p>
      <p>Finally, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is scheduled to speak around the market open Friday.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Today</h3>
      <p>Electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) declined 1.7% Friday, following a modest recall in China and after Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management dumped $26.8 million worth of Tesla shares on Thursday. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were lower after today's stock market open.</p>
      <p>Align Technology (ALGN), IBD SwingTrader stock Meta Platforms (META) and IBD Leaderboard Palo Alto Networks (PANW) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Nike and Salesforce (CRM) — are among the top stocks to watch in the ongoing stock market correction.</p>
      <p>Palo Alto is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Microsoft is featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column. And Meta is an IBD SwingTrader stock. Palo Alto, Align, Microsoft and Meta were all recent IBD Stock Of The Day subjects.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</h3>
      <p>After Friday's opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which does not track oil or financial stocks, dropped 0.3% in morning action.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.8% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) moved down 0.7% early Friday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Thursday slipped to 3.4%, falling sharply for a second-straight session. The 10-year yield is near its lowest level since early February. On Friday, the 10-year continued lower, falling to 3.29%.</p>
      <p>U.S. oil prices shifted sharply lower, as West Texas Intermediate traded down 3.6% to just above $67 a barrel. WTI futures are defending a mild gain for the week, after touching their lowest level since November 2021 on Monday.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Correction</h3>
      <p>On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rallied as much as 1.5% and 1.8%, respectively, before closing with modest gains of 0.2% and 0.3%. Both briefly turned lower in afternoon trade before a late-day bounce. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shrank an early 2.5% gain down to 1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was a laggard, reversing 0.4% lower.</p>
      <p>Thursday's Big Picture column commented, "The stock market ended higher but well off session highs Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen established that the U.S. government is ready to take 'additional action if warranted' to stabilize the banking sector."</p>
      <p>Now is an important time to read IBD's The Big Picture column amid the ongoing stock market correction.</p>
      <h3>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Nike, Salesforce</h3>
      <p>Since bottoming on Oct. 3, Nike shares have rallied as much as 59% to their recent high at 131.31. Now the stock is consolidating within a flat base that offers a 131.41 buy point, according to IBD MarketSmith pattern recognition.</p>
      <p>Amid Thursday's 1.2% gain, the stock is again consolidating back below its 50-day moving average, a key benchmark. NKE stock moved down 0.7% early Friday.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Dow Jones leader Salesforce showed big upside strength after strong fourth-quarter results. The stock is now above a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry after recent big gains. Still, the market is in a correction, so investors should avoid new purchases until the market environment improves. CRM stock fell 0.4% early Friday.</p>
      <h3>Top Stocks To Watch: Align, Meta, Palo Alto</h3>
      <p>Align Technology continues to trace a consolidation that has multiple buy points: a 357.10 early entry and a conventional entry at 368.97. Shares fell 0.7% Friday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: The company makes clear teeth-straightening systems called Invisalign. UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo says investors recently regained confidence in Align stock, which has surged 50% this year. December-ended quarter results from Align and its competitors, management commentary, U.S. economic data and a recent uptick in demand for Invisalign cases support this view, he said in a note to clients.</p>
      <p>Backstory: Like social media rivals, Meta is struggling due to a sharp reduction in advertising revenue as clients squirm over macroeconomic concerns, recession fears and higher interest rates. This is happening as it spends billions of dollars on a risky bet to build the "metaverse," a virtual reality world that has yet to take hold.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard stock Palo Alto Networks reclaimed its 192.94 buy point out of a cup with handle during Thursday's 1.6% move higher. The buy area runs up to 202.59. PANW stock traded down 0.6% Friday.</p>
      <p>Backstory: Through acquisitions, Palo Alto Networks has expanded into endpoint security and vulnerability management. Endpoint tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.</p>
      <h3>Tesla Stock</h3>
      <p>Tesla stock rose 0.6% Thursday, bouncing a bit after Wednesday's 3.25% skid. Shares continue to rebound from their 50-day moving average. Shares closed Thursday around 50% off their 52-week high.</p>
      <p>TSLA stock lost 1.7% Friday morning, as it threatened to give up Thursday's gains.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Leaders: Apple, Microsoft</strong></p>
      <p>Among Dow Jones stocks, Apple shares climbed 0.7% Thursday, recovering a large part of Wednesday's decline. AAPL stock fell 0.4% Friday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares are again trying to break out above a flat base's 276.86 buy point with a 2% gain Thursday. MSFT stock lost 0.6% early Friday.</p>
      <p>Microsoft shares surged last week after the company announced that it is adding artificial intelligence tools to its popular Office productivity applications. That follows the company's investments in AI startup OpenAI, the firm behind the buzzy ChatGPT application.</p>

    subCategory: ['Silver', 'ETFs', 'Gold'],
    description: <div className="blog-desc">
      <p>Precious metals like gold and silver have been rallying lately. This is because investors have been seeking safe-haven investments amid growing risks emanating from the banking crisis in the United States and Europe, high inflation, hawkish central banks, fear of prolonged global growth slowdown and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China relations as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Precious metals like gold and silver have been rallying lately. This is because investors have been seeking safe-haven investments amid growing risks emanating from the banking crisis in the United States and Europe, high inflation, hawkish central banks, fear of prolonged global growth slowdown and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China relations as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
	    <p>In the latest statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points (bps), to a funds range of 4.75%-5.00%. The move was largely expected. However, the Fed’s language in its statement grew notably milder from the last meeting, even as it clearly stated that inflation is still “elevated.” The Fed also indicated that “some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”</p>	
	    <p>A softening in the Fed’s hawkish tone and the resultant decline in U.S. rates should weigh on the dollar against a basket of currencies, raising the precious metals’ attractiveness as these do not pay interest like fixed-income assets. Notably, the U.S. dollar is now at a seven-week low. Analysts believe that precious metal prices will witness momentum.</p>	
	    <p>The Fed indicated that further increases in borrowing costs might be postponed (or there may be just one more rate hike worth 25 bps this year) due to the recent failure of two U.S. banks. A low-interest-rate environment makes non-yielding bullion an intriguing bet. Plus, gold is traditionally viewed as an inflation hedge and thus is well-positioned to take advantage of the recent spike in global inflation.</p>
      <p>SPDR Gold Shares GLD has risen 8.1% in the past month, while iShares Silver Trust SLV has gained 4%. But in the past five days, SLV has added 5.8% versus a 2.7% uptick in GLD (as of Mar 22, 2023).</p>
      <h3>What to Buy Ahead? Gold or Silver</h3>
      <p>We believe that gold has run up a little bit higher. It’s just 1% off from its 52-week high whereas silver is still 13% off its 52-week high. So, the poor man’s gold has more room to run than the yellow metal. Moreover, the operating backdrop is more favorable for silver as it has high usage in industrial activities. About 50% of the total demand for silver comes from industrial applications.</p>
      <p>The Fed is likely to take less-hawkish actions, going forward. This should bolster industrial activities. Manufacturing activity in China expanded and logged its highest reading in nearly 11 years. China’s reopening following the COVID-led lockdown is a huge plus for the manufacturing sector.</p>
      <p>Growth in the global solar PV industry and new sources of demand for sensors used in IoT are providing a boost to silver demand. The recent emergence and faster rollout of 5G globally is another positive for silver. The electronic components that enable 5G technology depend on silver greatly. Silver’s role in electronic applications used in 5G is forecast to rise significantly.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>If we go by the relative strength index (RSI), SLV has an RSI value of 64.31 while GLD has an RSI value of 66.95. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.</p>
      <p>Hence, the value indicates that while both ETFs are in high momentum, silver has good chances of outperforming gold. But if the economic backdrop remains this edgy, global growth slows down and inflation remains hot, gold will outshine the manufacturing metal silver.</p>
      <h3>ETFs in Focus</h3>
      <p>Apart from the largest ETF SLV, investors can also bet on the likes of Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF SIVR, Invesco DB Silver Fund (DBS) and ProShares Ultra Silver AGQ to realize gains in silver.</p>
      <p>And for gold ETFs, investing options include the likes of iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF SGOL and ProShares Ultra Gold UGL.</p>

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
    	<p>The Euro has fallen rather significantly during the trading session on Friday to reach down to the 1.07 level. At this point, the market has completely wiped out the post-FOMC burst higher, and now it looks like traders are starting to worry about risk appetite yet again. After all, the entire global economy seems to be threatened, as credit issues are going to be a significant weight around the neck of the markets.</p>
	    <p>It’s worth noting that the 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.07 level, and it is starting to turn higher again. That’s a technical indicator that will attract a lot of attention, but you can also make an argument for the fact that we have failed near the 1.09 level, which is basically where the market had collapsed from previously. At this point, it looks like the Euro is going to continue to see a lot of negativity going forward, or perhaps it should be said that the US dollar is going to be a lot of strength in this type of environment.</p>	
	    <p>Underneath, the 1.06 level is an area that a lot of people will be paying attention to, and then of course the 200-Day EMA that could offer quite a bit of support that sits just below there. The market breaking down below the 200-Day EMA would of course be extraordinarily negative, so therefore you need to pay close attention to a move like that. In that scenario, we would probably see a resumption of the overall negativity in the market.</p>	
	    <p>On the other hand, if we turn around a rally from here, we could get a short-term bounce, but I think at this point in time you need to see the Euro break above the 1.10 level to clearly enter a bullish phase. That of course would probably coincide with a lot of US dollar weakness in general, so pay attention to other currency pairs around the world, because if we see the US dollar falling everywhere, then it will give even more of a boost for buyers in this market. In general, this is a market that will continue to be very noisy, right around this area as we are trying to make a bigger decision.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Friday, which was not a huge surprise considering that we formed a couple of shooting stars during the previous 2 days. The 0.67 level is an area that a lot of people will be paying close attention to, as it has been important multiple times. Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to risk, and there are a lot of concerns that you need to pay attention to around the world, and that does work against the value of a currency like this.</p>

	    <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Friday, which was not a huge surprise considering that we formed a couple of shooting stars during the previous 2 days. The 0.67 level is an area that a lot of people will be paying close attention to, as it has been important multiple times. Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly levered to risk, and there are a lot of concerns that you need to pay attention to around the world, and that does work against the value of a currency like this.</p>
	    <p>That being said, it has been rather resilient in the sense that we could have broken down multiple times in the past, so I think more choppy volatility is probably ahead for the market. The 0.67 level has previously been support just a couple of weeks ago, with resistance at the 0.68 level. In other words, there’s a huge block of noise that people will be paying attention to. This is even further confirmed by the 50-Day EMA sitting at the top of it and dropping lower, a technical signal that a lot of people will be using as a directional indicator.</p>	
	    <p>If we do break down from here, the 0.6550 level is an area where we have seen a significant bounce from, so it should be a certain amount of support, but if we were to break down below there it could send this market much lower, perhaps down to the 0.65 level, maybe even down to the 0.63 level. That being said, when we look at this chart, it’s hard not to notice the fact that the market is trying to bounce a bit, and therefore by the end of the day we may have seen the market turn things completely around. If that is in fact going to be the case, then it’s possible that we could just simply enter a bit of consolidation, but either way, I am not bullish of the Australian dollar and will more likely than not stay that way for the time being, what could change my mind is if we take out the 0.68 level on a daily close.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- European companies are using more natural gas as prices drop to levels seen before the Ukraine war, putting a potential strain on preparations for another winter with limited Russian supplies.</p>
	    <p>The green shoots are mainly evident in the refining industry, which can switch more easily between raw materials ranging from natural gas to fuel oil. Earlier this month, Dutch data showed the country’s petroleum sector had the biggest weekly gain in gas use this year, while French and Spanish gas network figures indicated refiners’ demand advanced in February from a year earlier.</p>	
	    <p>The speed of the recovery will be crucial for the European Union and how it readies for a second winter with no pipeline gas from Russia. Rebounding demand could push prices past €100 ($109) per megawatt-hour this year, from about €43 now, and chip away at stockpiles, according Swedish bank SEB AB. It’s a view echoed by Vitol Group, one of the biggest gas traders.</p>	
	    <p>“Some manufacturing industries last year shifted from gas to fuel,” said Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive officer at TotalEnergies SE. “Now this year they are very reactive, they shift back from diesel or fuel to gas, so it’s creating an additional demand,” he said at a presentation in London on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>European Refiners Eye Natural Gas Again After Price Drop: BNEF</p>
      <p>Along with refineries, petrochemical plants will also be a good indicator of the recovery because they can easily switch back to gas to make power and heat, according to Energy Aspects Ltd.</p>
      <p>“Other gas-intensive sectors will take longer to recover over the course of 2023 owing to their demand reductions being the result of reducing output rather than fuel switching,” the industry consultant said.</p>
      <p>As gas prices soared to records at the height of the energy crisis, Spanish industrial gas demand plunged as much as 40% in September from a year earlier. Overall usage by factories and plants slumped about 20% last year in Europe, accounting for almost half of the record drop in total consumption last year, according to the International Energy Agency. This year, the IEA expects demand in industry to recover by about 10%.</p>
      <p>From a peak above €340 per megawatt-hour in late August, benchmark Dutch gas futures have dropped about 90%. In February, usage by Spain’s refiners soared 8.1%, helping to pare an overall drop by industry to 9.5% from a year earlier, network operator Enagas SA said.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, gas use in the petroleum and the chemical industries have also started to exceed last year’s levels this month, CBS data show.</p>
      <p>“Lower energy costs — combined, possibly, with stronger demand from China’s reopening — mean that we expect industrial production to make some positive contributions to growth in the euro area this year,” said Maeva Cousin, a senior euro-area economist at Bloomberg Economics.</p>

      <p>“It will take time for gas tariffs from gas suppliers to fall enough and over a sustainable period for factory managers to take the decision to resume output,” Energy Aspects said.</p>

      <p>That means some demand may be lost forever as factories relocated to parts of the world where energy costs are lower.</p>
      <p>Chemical firms BASF SE, Dow Inc. and Lanxess AG are poised to cut thousands of jobs and shift investment out of Germany because they don’t expect Berlin to reliably provide the energy they need at prices close to those they once paid for Russian pipeline gas.</p>

      <p>“The outlook for the future has brightened somewhat in Germany’s third-largest industry,” VCI said in a report this month. “The major drop in energy and raw material prices in recent months has stabilized the situation where the bottom seems to have been reached.

	    <h3>Gas Demand Recovery in Europe Gathers Pace as Prices Plunge</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- European companies are using more natural gas as prices drop to levels seen before the Ukraine war, putting a potential strain on preparations for another winter with limited Russian supplies.</p>
	    <p>The green shoots are mainly evident in the refining industry, which can switch more easily between raw materials ranging from natural gas to fuel oil. Earlier this month, Dutch data showed the country’s petroleum sector had the biggest weekly gain in gas use this year, while French and Spanish gas network figures indicated refiners’ demand advanced in February from a year earlier.</p>	
	    <p>The speed of the recovery will be crucial for the European Union and how it readies for a second winter with no pipeline gas from Russia. Rebounding demand could push prices past €100 ($109) per megawatt-hour this year, from about €43 now, and chip away at stockpiles, according Swedish bank SEB AB. It’s a view echoed by Vitol Group, one of the biggest gas traders.</p>	
	    <p>“Some manufacturing industries last year shifted from gas to fuel,” said Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive officer at TotalEnergies SE. “Now this year they are very reactive, they shift back from diesel or fuel to gas, so it’s creating an additional demand,” he said at a presentation in London on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>European Refiners Eye Natural Gas Again After Price Drop: BNEF</p>
      <p>Along with refineries, petrochemical plants will also be a good indicator of the recovery because they can easily switch back to gas to make power and heat, according to Energy Aspects Ltd.</p>
      <p>“Other gas-intensive sectors will take longer to recover over the course of 2023 owing to their demand reductions being the result of reducing output rather than fuel switching,” the industry consultant said.</p>

    	<p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Indian stock market may outperform its Asian and emerging market peers in the long term as lofty valuations ease and investors look to bet on the economy's growth prospects, brokerage group Jefferies said in a note.</p>
    	<p>The benchmark Nifty 50 Index's price-to-earnings premium to China's Hang Seng Index declined to 115% from 208% in end October, and is in line with the 10-year average of 118%, Chris Wood, global head of equity strategy, Jefferies, wrote in his "Greed & Fear" report.</p>	
	    <p>India's long-term prospects have led the global brokerage to invest 39% of its Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio in the south Asian country compared with 25% in China.</p>	
	    <p>While foreign investors have sold $2.8 billion on a net basis in Indian markets so far this year, domestic equity mutual fund inflows have remained positive, Wood said.</p>
      <p>Domestic equity mutual fund inflows in the first two months of 2023 amounted to 282.33 billion rupees ($3.43 billion), according to official data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.</p>
      <p>The usual challenge of relatively high valuations remain, Wood said, adding that the brokerage will remain slightly "overweight" on India in the Asia Pacific ex-Japan relative-return portfolio.</p>
      <p>"The domestic demand story certainly remains intact to justify the continuing belief in the equity market. Loan growth has slowed somewhat but still remains solid ... The recovery in the residential property market also continues," Wood wrote.</p>
      <p>Asian banking systems remain remarkably free from stresses, Wood said, citing a slide in the ratio of non-performing loans in Indian banks to an eight-year low.</p>

      <p>By Seher Dareen</p>
    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold dipped on Friday in a volatile week that saw bullion prices north of the key $2,000 figure as bank contagion fears bolstered both safe-haven demand and bets on a pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
    	<p>The U.S. dollar rose about 0.5%, making the greenback-priced gold more expensive among overseas buyers on Friday. [USD/]</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold fell 0.8% to $1,977.01 per ounce by 2:34 p.m. EDT (1834 GMT), after it rose to $2,002.89 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.6% to settle at $1,983.80.</p>	
    	<p>A somewhat firmer dollar and a rebound in equity markets and risk appetite are probably what has driven gold lower, said Bart Melek, head of commodity markets strategy at TD Securities. But bullion was likely to get continued support from big macro developments, Melek said. [MKTS/GLOB]</p>
      <p>Rescue measures for struggling banks eased contagion fears earlier in the week, putting gold on course for its first weekly decline in four, down about 0.5%, despite having climbed to its highest in a year above $2,000 on Monday.</p>
      <p>But banking shares were trounced again on Friday, with European giants Deutsche Bank and UBS knocked by worries that regulators and central banks have yet to contain the worst shock to the sector since the 2008 financial crisis. [.N]</p>
      <p>"Any concern that pops up about U.S. banks being undercapitalized is going to be a factor for gold to rise," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.</p>
      <p>Fed officials said there was no indication financial stress was worsening as they gathered at a policy meeting this week, a fact that allowed them to stay focused on lowering inflation with another interest rate increase.</p>
      <p>The U.S. central bank this week raised rates by an expected quarter of a percentage point but signalled it was on the verge of pausing.</p>
      <p>Silver eased 0.1% to $23.07, platinum fell 0.7% to $977.776, and palladium dropped 0.7% to $1,420.40.</p>

	    <p>Rising interest rates have been putting downward pressure on gold, but the shaky banking sector recently pushed prices past the $2,000 mark. With investor confidence in banks waning, this could continue to bolster gold prices as they seek to add precious metals for safety.</p>
	    <p>Along with the rescue of U.S. regional bank First Republic, Europe's Credit Suisse has been grabbing the financial news as of late with its recent rescue thanks to help from global investment bank UBS. Bank rescues can help re-instill market confidence, but more bank failures could continue to push investors to safe havens like gold.</p>	
	    <p>“Long-term damage has been done to the credibility of U.S. banks,” said Chintan Karnani, director of research at Insignia Consultants, who also noted in a MarketWatch report that the banking fallout could be just be the tip of the iceberg. “Significant price corrections (if any) in gold price will be for a very short period.”</p>	
	    <h3>3 Options for Gold Exposure</h3>
      <p>There are three options where investors can get gold exposure. For direct correlation to holding physical gold, consider the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), which is a fund that provides an enhanced physical bullion structure, offering the ease of purchase and sale that comes with being traded on an exchange.</p>
      <p>For a backdoor play on ancillary gold services, investors can also consider the Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM). If demand continues to rise for gold, this can have a domino effect on miners for indirect exposure to gold prices.</p>
      <p>Per SGDM’s fund description, the ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance of its underlying index, the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index. The index aims to track the performance of larger-sized gold companies whose stocks are listed on Canadian and major U.S. exchanges.</p>
      <p>The index uses a transparent, rules-based methodology designed to emphasize larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield, and the lowest long-term debt to equity. The index is reconstituted on a quarterly basis to reflect the companies that have the highest factor scores.</p>
      <p>Lastly, investors looking for gold exposure with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) component can consider the Sprott ESG Gold ETF (SESG). The fund directly sources from select gold producers that Sprott believe are leaders when it comes to ESG mining and sustainability.</p>
      <p>SESG also adds a backdoor play on gold prices, investing in ancillary services (i.e. mining) that support the gold market as opposed to the actual precious metal itself. In addition, the inclusion of an ESG filter gives conscious investors an opportunity to allocate capital to gold miners exhibiting ESG-friendly operations.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>A massive new gas pipeline to China could help reduce Russia's reliance on European buyers, but analysts say the project reveals a growing imbalance between the longtime strategic allies.</p>
	    <p>Beijing emerged as an economic lifeline for Moscow last year, especially through energy purchases, after Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut off crucial trade links.</p>	
	    <p>Moscow is confident that the new pipeline -- Power of Siberia 2 -- is going ahead, but Beijing has so far avoided an explicit commitment.</p>	
	    <p>Analysts say the lagging response shows an imbalance favouring Beijing in energy deals between the two countries -- as well as China's wariness of over-reliance on Russia for fuel.</p>
      <p>China is "in no rush to sign anything unless the proposal is favourable and is shaped on China's terms," researcher Maria Shagina at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Berlin told AFP.</p>
      <p>The project was discussed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week.</p>
      <p>Putin said after talks with Xi that "all agreements have been reached" on the Power of Siberia 2 project.</p>
      <p>But their joint statement only said the two sides will work on pushing forward "research and consultation" on the pipeline.</p>
      <p>The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for more details.</p>
      <p>Power of Siberia 2 could facilitate the transport of 50 billion cubic metres of gas to China annually, roughly on par with the total capacity of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany.</p>
      <p>A senior Russian official suggested last year that it could strategically replace Nord Stream 2.</p>
      <p>- 'Russia is desperate' -</p>
      <p>Previously the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Russia's gas exports plummeted in 2022 after a flurry of Western sanctions over the Ukraine war.</p>
      <p>As Europe looked for other suppliers, Moscow turned to alternative buyers including China, with which it is already linked by the first Power of Siberia pipeline.</p>
      <p>In 2022, China overtook Germany to become the top buyer of Russian energy. It has paid a total of $12.2 billion for coal, gas and oil from Russia so far this year, according to the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.</p>
      <p>Russian gas deliveries to China through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline reached a record 15.5 billion cubic metres last year.</p>
      <p>But sales to Asia pale in comparison with the 155 billion cubic metres of gas Russia exported to Europe prior to the Ukraine war.</p>
      <p>"Russia is desperate to send as much gas as possible eastwards as Europe strives to reduce its dependence on Russian gas," said Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute.</p>
      <p>And a potential Power of Siberia 2 gas deal would consolidate China as a long-term market, said Jaime Concha, a gas market expert at industry analysis firm Energy Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Russia's existing pipeline infrastructure "was mostly structured to cater to the European market", Concha told AFP.</p>
      <p>Building up an equivalent network in Asia would be costly and time-consuming, he said, "which shows how few alternatives Russia has".</p>
      <p>- 'Lessons from Europe' -</p>
      <p>China, meanwhile, has sought to ensure a diverse set of energy suppliers.</p>
      <p>It has signed a flurry of long-term gas deals around the world in recent years, including a $60 billion, 27-year agreement with Qatar in November.</p>
      <p>"Chinese policymakers also observe the lessons from Europe of overreliance on Russian energy imports," said Yan Qin, lead carbon analyst at Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>With a strengthened position in energy negotiations with Russia, "China emerged as the winner from the war in Ukraine", IISS researcher Shagina told AFP.</p>
      <p>"Beijing capitalised on Moscow's international isolation and ramped up its purchases of heavily discounted Russian oil, gas, and coal."</p>
      <p>At the same time, China has felt the bite from the turmoil in global energy markets.</p>
      <p>The war in Ukraine has pushed thermal coal prices at China's Qinhuangdao port "almost as high as Europe", Qin said, while rising LNG prices have hit gas power plants and industrial users.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, she said, the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline could "enhance China's gas imports capacity greatly and potentially reduce China's LNG imports demand".</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has rallied a bit against the US dollar early during the trading session on Thursday, breaking above the 1.23 level. 1.23 level is an area that begins the cluster that formed the double top at the 1.24 level. In other words, there will probably be a significant amount of resistance just above, so giving up some of the gains does make a certain amount of sense. After all, the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates, and has reiterated during the session on Wednesday and that they are going to stay tight going forward, even if that means that they have to continue tightening interest rates.</p>
	    <p>Looking at this chart, it certainly looks as if we are a little overextended anyway, and the fact that we gave back some of the gains does suggest that perhaps we are ready to start pulling back towards the US dollar. On the other hand, if we were to somehow break above the double top at the 1.24 level, that means that the market would then challenge the psychologically and structurally important 1.25 level. That being said, the market would then start to see the British pound take off to the upside, perhaps kicking off a huge move higher.</p>	
	    <p>If we break down from here, the 1.20 level underneath would be a large victory for the US dollar, as it is an area that’s been a bit of a magnet for price over the last several months, so it does suggest that perhaps we are going to see a bit of a fight in that area if we do get down to it. Anything under there would then threaten a move down to the 1.1850 level, an area that previously had been major support. That’s essentially the bottom of the overall consolidation area, and if we were to break down below there it opens up a bit of a trapdoor for falling prices. Ultimately, this is a market that looks a little heavy, so I’ll be looking for opportunities to short if there’s any opportunity to do so over the next several days.</p>

      <p>The Euro initially rallied significantly against the US dollar during the trading session on Thursday, but has run into a previous selling area, from which we plunged from.

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Euro initially rallied significantly against the US dollar during the trading session on Thursday, but has run into a previous selling area, from which we plunged from. At this point, the market is likely to see a bit of exhaustion set in, due to the fact that we went parabolic over the last couple of days. Whether or not the market starts to roll over and turn trends again, that’s of course a different question, but at this point it certainly looks as if we have gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.</p>
	    <p>Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve raised rates just 25 basis points during the session on Wednesday, but at the end of the day there are a lot of concerns around the world about the banking system, and if that’s going to be the case, the US dollar is going to be at a premium. This area that we are in right now is an area that had been so bearish previously that one would have to assume that there should be a significant amount of selling pressure.</p>	
	    <p>If we do break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the trading session on Thursday, then it’s likely that we could go down to the 1.08 level, an area that has been previous resistance. On the other hand, if we can rally above the top of the range for the Thursday session, we may try to threaten the 1.10 level, which of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area that would attract a lot of attention. Anything above there then would kick off the next great leg higher. I think at this point, there are so many different economic issues out there that it’s probably only a matter of time before the US dollar picks up strength again, so it will be interesting to see how they play this out going forward. Regardless, I would not be a buyer all the way up here without at least seeing the market consolidate for a while as I don’t like to chase trading positions after a market has made such a sharp move.</p>

      <h3>In this article:</h3>
      <p>The Bank of England (BoE) has raised the UK interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 4.25% to combat double-digit inflation.</p>
	    <p>This is the 11th time in a row, in less than 18 months, that the central bank has increased rates, making borrowing costs higher despite the cost of living crisis that has hit UK households.</p>
    	<p>It lifts UK interest rates to their highest since October 2008, early in the financial crisis, when Bank Rate was 4.5%.</p>
	    <p>It also comes after inflation took a surprise leap to 10.4% in February. Inflation hit a 41-year high at 11.1% in October.</p>	
	    <p>The monetary policy committee voted 7-2 in favour of a 25bps increase, with two members preferring to maintain at 4%.</p>	
	    <p>Seven members (governor Andrew Bailey, plus Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine Mann, Huw Pill and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of raising Bank Rate by a quarter-point, to 4.25%.</p>
      <p>But two members, Swati Dhingra and Silvana Tenreyro, voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 4%.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Casey, investment strategist at wealth manager Evelyn Partners, said: “The split in voting is indicative of the tricky state of affairs confronting the MPC and other central banks, with committee members having to weigh the fragility of the global banking sector against the need to bring inflation back to target.</p>
      <p>“The recent turmoil in the banking sector, which began with collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) nearly a fortnight ago, has reminded central banks that things can break when monetary policy is rapidly tightened. Although contagion risks from the tech bank crisis and Credit Suisse look to have receded for the time being, the BoE will need to tread carefully if it decides to further tighten monetary policy from here. The Bank recently acknowledged that ‘more sharp moves in asset prices could expose weakness in parts of Britain’s financial system’ in a letter to lawmakers."</p>
      <p>This increase will have an immediate impact on some borrowers and savers. High-street banks use the Bank's base rate to work out the interest rates it offers to customers.</p>
      <p>Sam Richardson, Which? money deputy editor, said: "This rate rise will push up housing costs for already hard-pressed households – with millions more likely to be hit over the coming months.</p>
      <p>"Those on a tracker mortgage will see an immediate impact on monthly repayments, and those on a variable rate could also see their costs rise. Mortgage owners on a fixed-term deal will not be affected for the duration of their deal, however they will likely be stung with much higher rates when the time comes to renew.</p>
      <p>"Homeowners struggling with payments should speak to their lenders, which are required to offer support, such as temporarily reducing payments or extending the mortgage term. Discussing your options with your lender will not affect your credit rating.</p>
      <p>"Higher rates will also have an impact on renters, as buy-to-let landlords will likely pass on increased costs to their tenants. If you are unsure about how you will be able to make monthly repayments, contact your landlord or letting agent to see if a different payment plan is available."</p>
      <p>The Bank of England says up to 4 million households face a higher monthly mortgage bill this year. An estimated 356,000 mortgage borrowers could face difficulties with repayments by July next year, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
      <p>When interest rates rise, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and variable rate deals usually see an immediate increase in their monthly payments.</p>
      <p>For the average UK property costing £270,708 on a variable rate and with a 75% LTV, monthly mortgage repayments would increase by £26 a month, according to data from TotallyMoney and Moneycomms.</p>
      <p>Three-quarters of mortgage customers hold a fixed-rate mortgage so their payments should not be affected for now but prospective house buyers or those seeking a remortgage will pay more.</p>
      <p>Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said: "For first-time buyers shopping around for a fixed rate deal, another interest rate rise will leave them feeling very nervous. Mortgage rates rose rapidly last year – hitting a peak of 6.5% in October in the wake of the mini budget chaos when unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets. Despite interest rates continuing to rise since then, the average two- and five-year fixed rates are currently at a six-month low as most of the recent Bank Rate rises were already priced in by lenders."</p>
      <p>Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla, commented: "We don't expect the increase in the base rate to make much difference to the outlook for the housing market. Demand for homes is down on last year but sales are still being agreed albeit at a slower rate (20% lower). People still want to move and households are resetting their plans in an environment of higher borrowing costs. Talk of a big price correction in home values has been overplayed and if you price your home sensibly, it’s likely to attract interest subject to some negotiation on the final price."</p>
      <p>The Bank of England said in its latest monetary policy report that global growth "is expected to be stronger than projected" in its last meeting and that the UK banking system "remains resilient".</p>
      <p>Markets predict this to be the final rate hike in the Bank of England’s run.</p>
      <p>"Assuming the broader inflation data continues to point to an easing in pipeline pressures, then we suspect the committee will be comfortable with pausing by the time of the next meeting in May," ING economist James Smith said.</p>
      <p>The BoE has raised its outlook for the economy in the near term, now expecting the economy to grow in second quarter.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “With rising prices strangling growth and eroding family budgets, the sooner we grip inflation the better for everyone.</p>
      <p>“That's why we support the Bank of England's actions today and why we will continue to play our part in this fight by being responsible with the public finances, alongside providing cost of living support worth an average of £3300 per household over this year and next.”</p>
      <p>The Bank of England follows other central banks in rising interest rates amid sticky inflation and an international banking crisis.</p>
      <p>The US Federal Reserve raised its main rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday but indicated it would stop further increases.</p>
      <p>The European Central Bank also raised its three main interest rates by 50 basis points last week.</p>
      <p>This Thursday, the Swiss National Bank’s policy rate has been lifted to 1.5%, from 1%, to counter “the renewed increase in inflationary pressure”.</p>
      <p>The Norges Bank’s Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Committee also announced today it had decided to raise the Norwegian policy rate from 2.75% to 3%, as it battles inflation.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished mixed this Thursday as the Bank of England raised interest rates to 4.25%.</p>
	    <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 0.69% to close at 7,515 points , while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.22% to 7,146 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.14% to 15,237.</p>	
	    <h3>Bank of England's interest rate hike</h3>
      <p>The Bank of England (BoE) has raised the UK interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 4.25% to combat double-digit inflation.</p>
      <p>This is the 11th time in a row in less than 18 months that the central bank has increased rates, making borrowing costs higher despite the cost of living crisis that has hit UK households.</p>
      <p>It lifts UK interest rates to their highest since October 2008, early in the financial crisis, when Bank Rate was 4.5%.</p>
      <p>Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at JP Morgan Asset Management, said: “The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee was right to raise interest rates by 25bps at its meeting today. It is possible that recent concerns in the global banking sector will serve to tighten credit conditions, but that is not guaranteed. As with the ECB last week and Fed last night, the Bank of England acted on the information it had today which is that the economy is still resilient, inflation is uncomfortably high and broadening, and wage growth is at a level that is inconsistent with a 2% inflation target.</p>
      <p>“We are concerned that the Bank will find itself outside of the central bank herd in the second half of the year. This is because the persistence of inflation appears more worrying in the UK than elsewhere, reflecting the fact that the combination of Brexit, the pandemic and an energy crisis appears to have done more lasting damage to the supply side of the economy.</p>	
	    <p>Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist, BlackRock Investment Institute, added: “The Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.25%, in line with our expectations – recent upside surprises in inflation show that we’re yet to see the back of the problem. The increase follows the Federal Reserve and ECB rate rises in recent days, and shows why we’re in a new regime; central banks will not ride to the rescue with rate cuts at the first sign of growth concerns, as we’ve been used to for a generation. Financial stability (stabilising the system given banking concerns, or in the UK’s case last year, the gilt yield spike) and monetary policy actions (dealing with inflation) are distinct.</p>
      <h3>US and Asia</h3>
      <p>Wall Street opened higher Thursday after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled its rate hiking campaign may be nearing an end amid concerns about stability in the global banking system.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 1.16% to 32,402 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 1.36% to 3,990 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 2% to 11,902.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate 0.25% to a 4.75%-5% target range, citing some additional policy firming may be appropriate. Additionally, the Fed said it would continue the same pace of reducing treasury and mortgage-backed security holdings.</p>
      <p>"On net, we think the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) episode and the fallout for the broader regional banking sector will work to slow credit, economic activity, and eventually inflation, resulting in the Fed needing to do less of the heavy lifting to tighten financial conditions," Tiffany Wilding, PIMCO North American economist, wrote in a statement following Powell's press conference.</p>
      <p>Although the Fed did lift US interest rates by a quarter-point, it also dropped its regular warning that “ongoing increases” in Fed Funds rate would be needed.</p>
      <p>“In other words, the Fed has toned down its statement to give it flexibility to pause the interest rate hiking cycle in May depending on incoming economic data,” saidMatthew Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com and City Index.</p>
      <p>Powell also moved to calm banking sector fears in the wake insisting that depositor funds were "safe" in the US banking system.</p>
      <p>The Fed chair said the measures taken in response to the failures, including a guarantee for all deposits held at the two lenders and a new Fed lending facility, "demonstrate that all depositors’ savings are safe".</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 0.17% to 27,419 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 2.05% to 19,993. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, rising 0.64% to 3,286 points.</p>
      <h3>FTSE 100</h3>
      <p>Back in London, the blue chip was in the red as banks lost as much as 1.1% after two straight days of gains.</p>
      <p>Schroders (SDR.L) led the losses, down 3.52%, with HSBC (HSBA.L) tumbling 2.35%, and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) falling by 2.70%.</p>
      <p>Informa (INF.L) dropped 2.25% after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the events organizer's stock to "equal-weight" from "overweight".</p>
      <p>The pound (GBPUSD=X) touched its highest level since the start of February this morning, as the City was right to anticipate another rise in UK interest rates.</p>
      <p>The pound reached $1.2325, up 0.5%, as the dollar slipped following last night’s Federal Reserve decision.</p>
      <h3>Oil markets</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) bounced back and was trading at around $76/barrel amid optimism around China's demand.</p>

	    <p>With the forces of geopolitics and social normalization trends converging, investors may want to consider energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. What exactly does that entail, though? For one thing, the underlying sector – especially the hydrocarbon arena – will command long-term relevance. While the ideological winds seek to replace fossil fuels, renewable sources often lack the energy density required to compete effectively.</p>
	    <p>The other component that makes the below energy stocks exceptionally compelling is that they hit the sweet spot of being undervalued (by objective standards) but highly rated among Wall Street analysts. Further, it’s not just about the baseline assessment itself. Rather, each of the names below commands an average price target that implies double-digit reward potential.</p>	
	    <h3>PBF Energy (PBF)</h3>
      <p>A petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, and lubricants (among many other products), PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) deserves special consideration as we recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. With social normalization trends likely to increase traffic volume on our roadways, PBF offers an opportunity to profit. Indeed, since the January opener, PBG gained over 12% of its equity value.</p>	
	    <p>Financially, the company isn’t perfect but it holds its own. For instance, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 5.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, PBF’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.61 times, favorably below the industry median of 1.67 times.</p>
      <p>Operationally, the refiner posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, ranked better than 79.48% of the oil and gas sector. Most importantly regarding this topic of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices PBF at a forward multiple of 4.94. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 71.07% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PBG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $51.44, implying over 22% upside potential.</p>
      <h3>Marathon Petroleum (MPC)</h3>
      <p>A petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation firm, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) is one of the larger players in its field. At the moment, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $56 billion. Since the Jan. opener, MPC returned shareholders almost 14%. In the past 365 days, it moved up 58%. Still, it technically ranks as one of the underrated energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot.</p>
      <p>Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.42. As a discount to earnings, Marathon Petroleum ranks better than 68.76% of sector rivals. In addition, MPC trades at 0.36 times sales. However, the sector median value, in this case, is 0.93 times.</p>
      <p>Notably, Marathon carries an Altman Z-Score of just under 4, indicating an enterprise safe from bankruptcy. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA pings at 1.12 times, below the sector median of 1.67 times. Moreover, Marathon’s a growth machine, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 27.1%. Lastly, covering analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $147.92, implying over 17% upside potential.</p>
      <h3>Valero Energy (VLO)</h3>
      <p>A downstream energy specialist, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly focuses on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. As well, it covers other petrochemical products and power. Because of the ongoing social normalization trends, VLO easily represents one of the more relevant energy stocks. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, they’re up nearly 37%.</p>
      <p>Even with the tremendous upside, VLO technically remains underrated. For instance, the market prices VLO at a trailing multiple of 4.43. As a discount to earnings, Valero ranks better than 68.61% of its peers. Also, VLO trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company beats out 80.23% of the industry.</p>
      <p>Further, Valero enjoys a robust balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.55. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.4%, outpacing 76% of competitors. In closing, analysts peg VLO as a consensus strong buy (with one sell rating). Overall, the average price target comes out to $161.67, implying over 25% upside potential.</p>
      <h3>Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY)</h3>
      <p>Based in Houston, Texas, Magnolia Oil & Gas (NYSE:MGY) is one of the underrated energy stocks for good reason. Since the beginning of this year, MGY fell over 7%. In the past 365 days, it gave up nearly 15% of its equity value. Still, the exploration and production (upstream) company could be an intriguing idea to consider, especially if you like to gamble.</p>
      <p>First, Magnolia enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio comes in at 1.73 times, outbidding 65.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.61, which ranks better than nearly 66% of the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.9%, while its net margin is nearly 53%. Both stats rank well into the industry’s upper half.</p>
      <p>Regarding valuation, the market prices MGY at a trailing multiple of 4.36. As a discount to earnings, Magnolia ranks better than nearly 70% of its peers. Also, its price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) is 4.64 times, below the industry median of 7.3 times. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MGY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $29.67, implying nearly 45% upside potential.</p>
      <h3>Devon Energy (DVN)</h3>
      <p>Focused on hydrocarbon exploration, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) commands a relevant profile among energy stocks. Unfortunately, DVN failed to resonate with investors so far this year. Since the Jan. opener, DVN gave up a worrying 19% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s off the mark by 23.5%. Nevertheless, for those that want to live a bit dangerously, DVN offers something to think about.</p>
      <p>Despite its market losses, Devon enjoys a decently stable balance sheet. Notably, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.65 times ranks better than 73.15% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 3.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.7% and a net margin of 31.38%. Both stats rank well in the upper half of the hydrocarbon sector.</p>
      <p>Most importantly for our discussion of energy stocks in the sweet spot, the market prices DVN at a forward multiple of 5.75. As a discount to earnings, Devon ranks better than 60.69% of its rivals. Looking to the Street, analysts peg DVN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target currently stands at $68.75, implying over 46% upside potential.</p>
      <h3>Arch Resources (ARCH)</h3>
      <p>A coal mining and processing firm, Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the U.S. Per its public profile, Arch is the second-largest supplier of coal in the nation. Despite its relevancies, since the beginning of this year, ARCH slipped over 2%. In the trailing year, it’s down 13%.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, for contrarian investors, ARCH may be one of the energy stocks sitting in the sweet spot. Presently, the market prices ARCH at a trailing multiple of 2.04. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 83.67% of sector players. Also, its price-to-FCF comes in at 2.65 times. Here, the applicable discount for Arch ranks better than 69.47% of the industry.</p>
      <p>Beyond the valuation, Arch benefits from a solid balance sheet, backed by an Altman Z-Score of 5.43. Also, the coal firm’s three-year EBITDA growth rate stands at 41%, above 74.15% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg ARCH as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target pings at $201.33, implying nearly 54% upside potential.</p>
      <h3>Evolution Petroleum (EPM)</h3>
      <p>Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. As with some of the riskier energy stocks, EPM looks shaky at the moment. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 20%.</p>
      <p>Still, for the contrarian investor, EPM could also rank among the underappreciated energy stocks to buy. Financially, Evolution benefits from excellent strengths in the balance sheet. In particular, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 17.84 times, above 77.23% of the industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 5.51 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>Regarding the theme at hand, the market prices EPM at a trailing multiple of 4.51. As a discount to earnings, Evolution ranks better than 68.46% of its rivals. Also, it trades at 2.82 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median value is 4.41. Lastly, Northland Securities’ Donovan Schafer, CFA, pegs EPM as a buy. Further, the expert anticipates shares hitting $11, implying nearly 97% upside potential.</p>

	    <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday as we are waiting for the FOMC meeting results. Obviously, the FOMC will have a major influence on what happens with the US dollar next, and therefore have a major influence on what happens with most major forex pairs. Currently, it looks as if we are getting close to the top of the range that we have been in, and therefore we will have to make some serious decisions. The 1.23 level sits just above, which is a short-term resistance barrier.</p>
	    <p>After that, then we have the 1.24 level, an area where we had formed a major double top, and therefore it will be interesting to see if that holds on any type of big move to the upside. The 1.24 level begins an area that extends to the 1.25 level, so it’s obvious that there are a lot of things above that could come into the picture and cause problems. Keep in mind that the market has been chopping back and forth for a while, and therefore one would have to assume that we could keep doing that.</p>	
	    <p>The 200-Day EMA sits just below the 1.2150 level, with the 50-Day EMA sitting just below there as well. However, that’s not the bottom of the range that I’m looking at, and it extends all the way down to the 1.1850 level. All things being equal, this is a market that is more likely than not going to stay in this range, and as we are closer to the top than the bottom, unless we get some type of extraordinarily dovish statement or action out of the Federal Reserve, which could send the dollar plunging.</p>	
	    <p>However, at this point it’s all speculation and we need to see what ends up being the case with the Federal Reserve and what they are going to do. With this, a lot of caution will be needed, but if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 basis points and sounds like they are still looking to fight inflation, one would have to anticipate that the double top above will hold.</p>

    description: <div className="blog-desc">

	    <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	    <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday to test the 1.08 level. The 1.08 level is an area that previously has been resistance, so it should be well known as an area that we could struggle at. Furthermore, the Euro has rallied rather drastically over the last couple of days, so you would have to keep in mind that we may see signs of exhaustion, and a FOMC meeting might be the perfect reason.</p>
	    <p>The Euro is now heading into an area that has been sold off rather aggressively, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see hesitation if we did rally. However, the FOMC meeting could change everything, so you need to be very cautious with putting big positions into the market. The market breaking above the 1.08 level would be very bullish, but again, there’s a lot of noise above that could cause significant selling pressure all the way up to the 1.0950 level.</p>	
	    <p>The 50-Day EMA sits near the 1.0650 level and is rising. The 50-Day EMA is an indicator that a lot of people will pay attention to, so could be dynamic support. Any short-term pullback at this point will more likely than not offer value the people are willing to pay attention to, unless of course the Federal Reserve remains extraordinarily hawkish.</p>	
	    <p>If that’s the case, then we could see the market could break down and go looking towards the 1.06 level. The 1.05 level underneath there would be massive support as well, and breaking down below that area would also be a break of the 200-Day EMA. That of course is a very negative sign and could send the market much lower. In that environment, we could be looking at a move down to the 1.03 level, perhaps down to the parity level.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this is a market that will be making a lot of decisions over the next couple of days that could be more permanent, but at this point it still looks like there is a lot of trouble above that could keep a bit of a lid on any Euro rally.</p>

      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied during early hours on Wednesday as we wait for the FOMC meeting results and of course the interest rate situation afterwards.

	    <p>The Australian dollar has rallied during early hours on Wednesday as we wait for the FOMC meeting results and of course the interest rate situation afterwards. Ultimately, the 0.68 level is major resistance, which extends all the way down to the 0.67 level. This is a situation where we are more likely than not going to cause some issues, and therefore it’s likely that signs of exhaustion will be jumped on.</p>
	    <p>The 0.68 level above offers a significant amount of resistance that is now backed up by the 50-Day EMA, so that must be kept in the back of your mind at this point. Even if we do break out above there, the upside is somewhat limited due to the fact that there are plenty of areas of trouble above. That being said, the market will continue to be very noisy, and therefore it’s likely that we see sellers into the market center later. This makes quite a bit of sense considering that the Australian dollar is so highly levered to the global commodity market, which of course is levered to the global growth situation.</p>	
	    <p>As things stand right now, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of back-and-forth and volatile concerns, meaning that the Australian dollar is probably going to suffer at the hands of US dollar strength. This will be especially true due to the fact that the FOMC meeting will more likely than not introduce another rate hike, and of course the statement and press conference will be paid close attention to as well. If Jerome Powell sounds hawkish, the Australian dollar will more likely than not be a major victim as there will be concerns about global recession, which is very toxic for the Aussie.</p>	
	    <p>Furthermore, we have been in a downtrend for a while, so it’ll be interesting to see if this holds up. You could make an argument for a little bit of a rising wedge at the moment, which of course is a bearish candlestick pattern as well. Regardless, I think it’s probably a market that you do not want to be long of, so if you were looking to sell the US dollar against a currency, you may want to do that against another one.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- Australian coal is finally flowing to China, opening up another avenue for shipments in what’s shaping up as an increasingly oversupplied market this year.</p>
	    <p>Some 207,000 tons arrived in China in February, including 73,000 tons of the higher-grade coking coal prized by steel mills, according to customs data. Although the total is just a sliver of China’s massive import haul of over 60 million tons so far this year, they’re Australia’s first new cargoes since Beijing imposed its unofficial ban in late 2020 after relations with Canberra soured.</p>	
	    <p>Before the halt, Australia was China’s No. 2 overseas supplier after Indonesia. But that ranking has since been taken by Russia, which has seen its sales to China boom after other buyers shunned its product due to the invasion of Ukraine. Now, Australia is back in the mix, with imports that could rise to 20 million tons this year, according to one industry estimate.</p>	
	    <p>Steelmakers in particular are likely to be glad of the extra supply after Mongolia, another key miner of coking coal, launched a new auction system that raised prices for Chinese buyers, according to industry news portal Yulin Coal Web.</p>
      <p>But at the same time, China is mining record quantities of the fuel as it prioritizes energy security after a string of power outages in recent years. Output in the first two months climbed to 734 million tons. Including imports, Fengkuang Coal Logistics estimates that China had about 65 million tons of additional coal in the first two months compared to last year.</p>
      <p>The extra supply is doubtless designed to feed the reopening of China’s economy after three years of Covid Zero restrictions. But Beijing’s modest growth targets, as well as plans to curtail steel output, suggest the fuel has been secured out of an abundance of caution that could end up pressuring prices, limiting any windfall to Australia’s miners.</p>

      <p>The signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company in India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), and France’s leading energy oil and gas firm, TotalEnergies, as recently tweeted by the French company, may open the way for a renewed push by Western companies in China’s arch rival in the Far East. This, in turn, might begin to shift momentum back into the US’s longstanding plans for India to act as a key counterbalance to China’s ever-increasing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
      <p>The MoU between TotalEnergies and ONGC is geared towards the initial exploration of deepwater blocks, especially in and around Mahanadi and Andaman off India’s east coast, according to the French company’s tweet. Towards this end, ONGC last year also signed a heads of agreement with U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil for deepwater exploration on India’s east and west coasts. This latter deal will focus on the exploration of the Krishna Godavari and Cauvery Basins in the eastern offshore area and the Kutch-Mumbai region in the western offshore. According to ONGC’s director of exploration, Shri Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, the collaboration between it and ExxonMobil is likely to last for many years and will be a key part of ONGC’s ability to ensuring energy security for India.</p>
	    <p>These long-term strategic energy partnerships between flagship Western oil companies and India are precisely what the U.S. had envisioned back in 2019 when it was putting together its ‘relationship normalisation deals’ initiative. This initiative had originated in the aftermath of the U.S.’s unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or colloquially, ‘the nuclear deal’) in May 2018, as analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets. From that point, Israel’s concerns about Iran’s nuclear program escalated and the U.S. knew that any major attack by Israel against Iran could well be a catalyst for a broader conflict across the entire Middle East. This, in turn, could eventually draw China and Russia as key sponsors of Iran into direct opposition to the US, a key sponsor of Israel. The U.S. also knew that several of its remaining allies in the Middle East shared Israel’s fear about Iranian intentions following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. In an attempt to counterbalance these fears, the administration under then-U.S. President Donald Trump came up with the relationship normalisation deals initiative. On 13 August 2020, it was announced that Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would normalise relations in a deal that had been brokered by the US – the first of the relationship normalisation deals program.</p>
    	<p>For the program to work effectively for the long term, though, the U.S. needed a substitute big buyer of energy to China be found that could form a unified oil and gas supply and demand network with the US and its allies at the centre, rather than China and Russia. Both Beijing and Moscow were targeting the same countries as the U.S., with the exception of Iran, and had two significant advantages over the U.S. in attracting politically wavering Middle Eastern countries to their sphere of influence. First, Russia was the key player – alongside Saudi Arabia – in the ‘OPEC+’ oil supply alliance. Second, China was the big buyer in the global oil demand pool. Therefore, the U.S. posited, the substitute buyer for China had to be big and full of promise, and the obvious candidate was India.</p>	
    	<p>India’s role as the US counterpoint to China in the Indo-Pacific region was further underlined by data released in the first quarter of 2021 by the IEA. This showed that India would make up the biggest share of energy demand growth - at 25 percent - over the next two decades, as it overtook the European Union as the world’s third-biggest energy consumer by 2030. India’s energy consumption was expected to nearly double as the nation’s GDP expanded to an estimated USD8.6 trillion by 2040 under its national policy scenario. This was underpinned by a rate of GDP growth that added the equivalent of another Japan to the world economy by 2040, according to the IEA. Politically as well, there had been several developments – also analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets – that pointed to India finally making substantive progress on its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy as an alternative to China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative.</p>	
	    <p>The U.S.’s vision of the intertwining of the relationship normalisation deals initiative with the economic and political development of India was initially illustrated through an early series of major oil deals between the UAE and India. Perhaps the most notable of these was the landmark decision by India that allowed the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to export oil from the country’s vitally-important strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) if there was no domestic demand for it. This was in line with ADNOC being the only overseas company allowed to hold and store any part of India’s SPR. Another sign of the UAE and India developments moving in the way that the U.S. wanted for its ‘relationship normalisation deals’ model was ADNOC being put ‘top of the list’ of foreign companies being considered as the lead buyer in the high-profile privatisation of major Indian refiner, Bharat Petroleum. Russian state corporate proxy, Rosneft, had expressed an interest in buying the Indian government’s 53.29 percent stake in the company at that time but had been subsequently side-lined by ADNOC.</p>
      <p>Since then, and especially in light of India’s equivocal stance on Russia just before and after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, questions have remained on which way India will jump in the reordering of the global oil markets that is currently underway. However, with the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer, currently shipping in over 85% of its oil from overseas, India still remains in play as far as the West is concerned. The country is recovering economically from the effects of COVID-19 at a  slower pace than had been expected and is therefore looking to monetise its oil and gas resources as quickly as possible to minimise energy import costs. ExxonMobil’s prime position in several major sites and TotalEnergies’ new MoU have significantly bolstered the existing presence of Western firms in India to take advantage of this situation. September 2022 saw ONGC sign another agreement, with Chevron New Ventures (a subsidiary of U.S. energy giant, Chevron), to assess exploration potential in India. This deal is geared towards exploring the geologically challenging and difficult developments in Category-I, II and III of India’s sedimentary basins.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>Despite ongoing market volatility and a sluggish start to 2023, the price of gold and silver continues to outperform on Wall Street while maintaining an upward trend towards historic highs.</p>
	    <p>A Kitco News' online survey showed gold could top out at a record $2,100 an ounce in 2023, and silver could jump more than 50% to reach $38 an ounce this year. However, since Jan. 1, gold has only recorded modest gains, as silver backpedaled beneath the redline over the same time.</p>	
	    <p>The price of gold futures peaked at $2,014.90 on Monday before quickly retreating below the $2,000 marker, while silver continues to rally strong in recent weeks, rising roughly 4% the last month and another 3.1% the last week.</p>	
	    <p>In an interview with FOX Business, Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, said, "Both gold and silver added 15% to 20% over the last six months, while the overall market was in the range of 2% to 4% growth."</p>
      <p>"Things are just starting to heat up," he added. "In fact, the long-term projections in the precious metals market could get even higher."</p>
      <p>"And regardless of the Fed's position, few Americans have faith that the U.S. dollar will strengthen, providing a strong case for allocating a portion of funds to a tangible and secure asset," Rose added.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date, the U.S. dollar has slipped roughly 0.27% and is now just $0.93 of the euro and $0.82 of the pound sterling.</p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve will announce another interest rate decision on Wednesday, after the latest bump placed rates in the range of 4.5% to 4.75%, notching the highest mark since 2007 and the eighth consecutive increase.</p>
      <p>The interest rate hike in February followed a half-point jump in December and four 75-basis-point hikes earlier in 2022.</p>
      <p>Rose said in light of several major banking institutions failing over the last few weeks, "you now have the government and Fed claiming they can orchestrate a soft landing."</p>
      <p>"No one knows exactly what will happen in the future," he rebutted. "Historically speaking, you would be hard-pressed to find a more consistent option than precious metals to place your hard-earned money when the economy is crashing."</p>
      <p>According to Morgan Stanley, "The volatility of silver prices can be two to three times greater than that of gold on a given day," due to the silver market being much smaller than the yellow metal’s, resulting in lower market liquidity.</p>
      <p>However, silver’s increasing applications in industry could begin closing the gap in 2023, particularly as the automotive sector makes greater shifts to electric, and alternate forms of energy are harnessed through solar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, gold remains the enduring metal on Wall Street because of its connection to currency alongside supply and demand factors, despite being primarily used in industry for its properties as a conductor in electronics manufacturing in both the aerospace and defense.</p>

	    <p>Gold bugs have been waiting for this moment. The precious metal touched $2,000 an ounce on Monday amid a wobbly banking sector, elevated inflation, and expectations of a 25 basis point rate hike (or none at all) at the next Fed meeting.</p>
	    <p>“When things get scary out there, investors run to safe havens, and gold is basically one of those major safe havens,” Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Inthemoneystocks.com and verifiedinvesting.com.</p>	
	    <p>Gold futures (GC=F) are up 6% since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the closure of Signature Bank of New York spurred concerns of a banking contagion. Europe’s Credit Suisse debacle also sent investors into assets like bitcoin and precious metals.</p>	
	    <p>“We have seen kind of a flee from the banking system," said Soloway. “Money absolutely did move away into gold and that’s definitely one of those fear-factor trades that has helped gold go higher."</p>
      <p>“Recent price gains have likely sapped some of the support for a further rally, even though the Fed is likely closer to their peak interest rate and the U.S. dollar may weaken further," Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle told Yahoo Finance. "That said, the trend is likely to remain higher, especially as demand from Asia recovers as China reopens this year."</p>
      <p>While gold bulls see the precious metal going past its previous record high of $2,074.88 some time before the end of 2023, the real fireworks are expected next year.</p>
      <p>“By 2024, I would actually say we’ll get well above $3,000, maybe $3500,” said Soloway, who expects prices to reach $2,100 by the end of this year. “2024 will be the big year for gold. That’s going to be the monster up year.”</p>
      <p>The future also looks bright for mining stocks, he said. Those underperformed last year as the costs to mine rose, but prices for the underlying metal did not.</p>
      <p>"We will see inflation that is somewhat lightly elevated, but it's not going to be at the levels that it was over the last year or so, and with gold really starting to play catchup, the miners are going to do really well over the next couple of years," said Soloway.</p>

      <p>Oil prices appear to have taken a break from focusing on macro events, with increasing demand and disruptions in supply pushing oil prices higher at the start of the week. The real news for oil markets this week, however, will come from the Fed's meeting.</p>
	    <p>- As French strikes are moving into their third week and at least four refineries are winding down operations due to blocked ports and overflowing stocks, Europe’s diesel woes are making a counter-seasonal comeback.</p>
	    <p>- French refining, recording 990,000 b/d in the last reported month of January 2023, is heavily geared towards diesel, but cannot meet the country’s hefty 850,000 b/d demand for the product.</p>	
    	<p>- Consequently, the spread between the prompt and second month of Europe’s diesel benchmark contract, the ICE low-sulfur diesel, rose to a premium of $35 per barrel, the highest since November 2022.</p>	
	    <p>- France might be the epicenter of the diesel squeeze because the blockage of import terminals across the country is limiting diesel importers from buying products, with diesel imports falling 50% this month compared to February.</p>
      <h3>Market Movers</h3>     
      <p>- US LNG developer Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) has reached a final investment decision for the 13.5 mtpa capacity Phase 1 of the Port Arthur LNG project in Texas, estimating costs at $13 billion.</p>
      <p>- Italian oil major ENI (BIT:ENI) made a new 200 million-barrel discovery with its Yatzil exploration well in Mexico’s offshore Block 7, hitting 40m of net oil pay some 40 miles off the coast.</p>
      <p>- Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) conglomerate sped up its pace of stock buybacks, having already repurchased more than $1.8 billion of its stock in 2023 to date, suggesting the company is still undervalued.</p>
      <p>Tuesday, March 21, 2023</p>
      <p>Having survived the macro mayhem of last week, oil prices have marginally rebounded this week, with ICE Brent climbing toward $75 per barrel again. The perennial bulls have started to discuss the commodity supercycle again, while the UN published yet another report of a “ticking climate bomb”. For a second it might even feel like a return to the idyllic past when only supply and demand mattered. However, that feeling will likely be a brief one as the Fed starts its two-day meeting on Tuesday, potentially creating another downside factor for prices.</p>
      <p><strong>US Oil Exports Hit Record Highs.</strong>US crude exports are set for an all-time high this month, with outflows to Europe averaging 2.1 million b/d so far as wide discounts for the WTI benchmark and a significantly lower domestic refining pull compel oil producers to export as much as they can.</p>
      <p><strong>G7 Holds Back on Price Cap Revision.</strong>The G7 group is reportedly not seeking to revise the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil this week, three months after it came into effect on December 05, claiming there is no appetite among the members to alter policy.</p>

      <p><strong>French Refinery Disruptions Get Worse.</strong>Four out of France’s six refineries, a total of 883,000 b/d of refining capacity, are poised to halt operations this week as nationwide protests against President Macron’s decision to increase the retirement age to 64 years spiral out of control.</p>
      <p><strong>Chevron Tanker Collides with Sanctioned Vessel.</strong>The Kerala oil tanker, chartered by US oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to transport some of its heavy Venezuelan crude at the Bajo Grande terminal, collided with Bueno, a sanctioned vessel that had carried Iranian oil in the past, in Venezuelan waters.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, to reach toward the sea ¥132.50 level. This is the top of the range from the previous session, suggesting that perhaps we are trying to figure out whether or not we can kick off the uptrend again. The 50-Day EMA is starting to break down below the 200-Day EMA, kicking off another bearish signal. Nonetheless, the reality is that both moving averages are essentially flat, and therefore it suggests that we are going to go back and forth.</p>
	    <p>The ¥135 level above is a major resistance barrier, but I do think that’s where we attempt to get to before it’s all said and done. This will be especially true when it comes down to what’s going on with the bond market, as the Bank of Japan continues to fight higher interest rates. That being said, interest rates have been dropping as of late, and that’s part of what has pushed the value of the Japanese yen higher at one point.</p>
	    <p>Underneath, the ¥130 level is an area where I think a lot of people will be paying close attention to, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. Underneath there, we have the double bottom that formed at the ¥127.50 area. It’s also where the 50% Fibonacci level from the huge move last year, and therefore it makes a certain amount of sense that the market will pay close attention to it. That being said, the most important factor to keep in the back of your mind is that the Federal Reserve has a meeting on Wednesday, and therefore it’s likely that we will be paying close attention to it for hints as to where the Federal Reserve is going next.</p>	
	    <p>After all, there have been tremors in the global financial system, so a lot of people are hoping that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates very much, or at all. However, with inflation running as rapid as it is, it’s very difficult to imagine a scenario where they do not. As they raise interest rates, rates could very well right across the board, putting more downward pressure on the yen and allow this pair to go higher.</p>

	  <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	  <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday to reach the 1.08 level. That being said, this is an area that should be a significant amount of resistance all the way up to the 1.10 level, and with the Federal Reserve meeting coming on Wednesday, I suspect that we could be setting up for a trade. A lot of this will come down to whether or not Jerome Powell is hawkish or dovish, and what they do as far as interest rates are concerned. There is consensus across the board that nobody really knows, and I think that’s probably part of what you are seeing here.</p>
	  <p>While Wall Street and various large firms want the Federal Reserve to stop raising rates, the reality might be something different. After all, they start to worry about inflation, and if they choose to loosen monetary policy again, that will almost certainly kick off even more inflation. That being said, the market has been arguing with the Fed for a while, and now that we have had a couple of banks failed, they believe that the Fed simply “must loosen” sooner than later.</p>	
	  <p>The market has sold the US dollar as of late, but if Jerome Powell and company surprise everyone, and stay extraordinarily hawkish, that could send this market plunging. I do think that the next couple of trading sessions could be rather important, so therefore we need to be watching how the market behaves. Any sign of exhaustion between now and 1.09 has to be looked at with suspicion, as it’s an area where we have seen an impulsive move lower, as the market started to plunge. It’s probably worth noting that we bounced from the 200-Day EMA, so that of course is a bullish sign, but right now it could be a target if we break down. On the other hand, if we do rally from here, you need to be cautious of the 1.10 level above, because if we were to somehow break above there, that could open up a huge leg higher in the Euro. That would almost certainly involve the Federal Reserve changing its overall tune.</p>

  	<h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
	  <p>The Australian dollar has pulled back a bit against the US dollar during trading on Tuesday, as traders are going to have to start focusing on the FOMC Meeting for the Wednesday session. After all, the entire world seems to be paying attention to whether or not the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, and by how much. Currently, there is the overall expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise by 25 basis points, but there are some out there that believe it could be 50 basis points, while others believe that they will have to stop raising rates altogether.</p>
	  <p>With that being said, the next 24 hours could be a bit lackadaisical, but it’s also worth noting that the area just above is major resistance as well, so therefore I do tend to favor the downside at this point. The market seems to have a block of resistance between 0.67 and 0.68, therefore I would be surprised to get above there before we get to the meeting itself. If we break down below the 0.6650 level, then we could drift down to the 0.66 level. I anticipate that the next 24 hours could be very sideways, so I would not put too much money to work right away. However, it’ll be interesting to see whether or not people are willing to put money to work.</p>	
	  <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to risk appetite and commodities around the world, so that obviously will have its influence as per usual. Beyond that, risk appetite in general needs to be seen in order for the Australian dollar to really start to rally, so if we get some type a surprise move, that would obviously be very bullish for risk appetite in general. Nonetheless, most of the move that we have seen earlier in the day makes sense, because a lot of people will not want to be overly exposed to price fluctuations as there are too many unknowns. More likely than not, if you are a short-term trader, you are looking at this through the prism of range bound opportunities on short-term charts between now and the meeting.</p>

      <h3>In this article:</h3>
      <p>UK public sector borrowing hit a new record in February, driven by the cost of the government’s energy support schemes.</p>
      <p>Borrowing, the difference between spending and tax income, was £16.7bn, last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p>
	    <p>The ONS said the extra spending on energy subsidies in February 2023 compared with a year earlier was estimated to be about £9.3bn.</p>
	    <p>The cost of energy support has now reached about £34bn since it was put in place last October.</p>	
	    <p>The Treasury kept household energy bills at £2,500 a year on average under its Energy Support Scheme.</p>	
      <p>The latest ONS data also revealed that £6.9bn of interest payable on debt also pushed February borrowing higher, although this was down by £1.3bn — the first fall in debt interest payments since April 2021 due to easing inflation.</p>
	    <p>Public sector borrowing was the highest February figure since monthly records began in 1993 and higher than the £11.7bn expected by most economists. It takes the year-to-date total to £132.2bn</p>
      <p>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said borrowing was "still high" because the government was supporting households with the rising cost of living.</p>
      <p>Hunt said: “Borrowing is still high because we’re determined to support households and businesses with rising prices and are spending about £1,500 per household to pay just under half of people’s energy bills this winter.</p>
      <p>The ONS said £5bn was raised through the new windfall tax on UK energy company profits. Tax income was also £5bn higher than a year ago at £77.8bn.</p>
      <p>“What will bring these costs right down is lower inflation, which is why it remains one of our top priorities to halve it this year, alongside growing our economy and reducing debt.”</p>

      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee ended little changed on Tuesday, as investors were wary ahead of a pivotal U.S. Federal Reserve bank meeting decision, amid major economies grappling with a banking sector crisis.</p>
	    <p>The rupee ended at 82.6550 per dollar, compared to its previous close of 82.6350. It moved in a narrow 15 paisa range all day.</p>
	    <p>Initial dollar bids from large state-run corporates and lacklustre trading volumes ahead of the Fed meeting led to the rupee staying contained in a range, said two traders.</p>	
	    <p>Heading into the risk event, traders said they built "slightly" long USD/INR positions as foreign exchange markets are shut in India on Wednesday.</p>	
	    <p>Asian currencies were flat to marginally higher, tracking a sombre dollar index.</p>
      <p>Focus shifts to the Fed decision, due Wednesday, with investors going back to expecting a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate hike amid relative calm after a crisis emanating from Credit Suisse and U.S. mid-sized lenders had roiled financial markets over the past week.</p>
      <p>Fed funds repricing has been quite volatile off late, and at one point on Monday it indicated higher chances of a pause than a hike, fuelled by global central banks pledging liquidity support in the wake of the banking crisis.</p>
      <p>"A 25 bps move...can either be read as a sign of confidence in the financial sector and a reiteration of the inflation focus or as a policy misjudgement that could accelerate banking troubles," ING analysts said in a note.</p>
      <p>"On the flip side, a hold may either reassure investors or be interpreted as a de-facto sign of alarm."</p>
      <p>Clear direction is possible only from the Fed's commentary and the dot plot, said a foreign bank trader.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>High inflation, a banking crisis, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions; it’s no wonder gold is finding a bid. Is this rally going to fade or is it signal of what is to come?</p>
	    <p>Gold is a bit of an oddball asset and is shrouded by conspiracy and half-truths. While commonly regarded as an inflation hedge, it doesn’t actually correlate very well with the rate of inflation. In 2022, we saw that during the worst bout of inflation in 50 years, gold prices were unchanged over the year. Nonetheless, gold has continuously grinded higher over the last two decades in line with the expansion of central bank balance sheets.</p>	
	    <p>Gold, while not a great stand-alone investment can provide some valuable portfolio diversification. Its returns are generally quite lumpy, but often provides standout performance during periods of very high market stress.</p>
      <h3>Technical Setup</h3>	
      <p>A long-term price chart of gold futures shows a compelling technical chart pattern has developed over the last 10 years. A prototypical cup and handle pattern indicates there may be more room to run for the yellow metal.</p>
	    <p>A monthly close above $2000 signals a breakout that can extend to $2400, although a reversal back into the range would invalidate the setup.</p>
      <h3>Barrick Gold</h3>
      <p>Barrick Gold GOLD, based in Toronto, Canada, is the largest gold mining company in the world. GOLD has many advanced exploration and development projects located across five continents. The company produced 4.1 million ounces of gold in 2022 and has 76 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves.</p>
      <p>Barrick Gold currently earns a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a mixed earnings revision trend. We can see that the current and next quarter have seen some small revisions lower, but the current year and next year are looking higher. Furthermore, the major factor determining Barrick’s returns are going to be the price of gold. Thus, if we see continued strength in gold prices, Barrick should follow.</p>
      <p>So far this year Barrick Gold is up 8% and trading in line with the underlying commodity. Over the last year GOLD stock is down -22% considerably underperforming gold.</p>
      <p>GOLD is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 20x, which is below the industry average of 22x and below its own five-year median of 21x. Additionally, Barrick Gold has a dividend yield of 2.3%, and has raised its dividend an average of 30% annually over the last five years. Barrick Gold’s dividend yield can make the stock more compelling than the underlying commodity because gold has no cash flow.</p>
      <h3>Yamana Gold</h3>
      <p>Yamana Gold AUY is another Canada based gold producer. It operates both gold and copper exploration and development sites in North America, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.</p>
      <p>Over the last five years Yamana Gold stock has performed quite well, outperforming both its respective industry and the broad market. AUY also offers a dividend yield of 2%, which it has increased by an average of 44% annually over the last three years.</p>
      <p>AUY boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Over the last 60 days analysts have raised earnings expectations for all future earnings periods.</p>
      <p>The company’s EPS surprised to the upside by 25% last quarter. Additionally, AUY has a history of beating earnings expectations having missed only once over the last five years.</p>
      <p>Currently trading at 19x one-year forward earnings AUY is above its three-year median of 17x, and below the industry average of 22x.</p>
      <h3>Additional Picks</h3>
      <p>There are two additional options for adding exposure to gold. The first is through the most popular gold ETF GLD, which does a good job of tracking the underlying price of gold.</p>
      <p>The second option is the gold miners ETF GDX. This ETF holds a portfolio of gold mining companies like the ones featured here. GDX is generally more volatile than the underlying commodity, which can be great if you time it correctly with a rally, or painful if the timing is poor.</p>
      <p>With Gold breaking out above $2000 there is no doubt that we are going through unprecedented times. Even if you aren’t trading gold as it stands now, at the least it can be used as an indication of the state of capital markets. If investors are reaching for gold, you can assume uncertainty is on the rise.</p>

      <h3>In this article</h3>
      <p>Britain’s FTSE 100 plunged by nearly 2 per cent in early morning trading on Monday despite UBS’s £2.7 billion rescue deal to save troubled lender Credit Suisse.</p>
      <p>The takeover, announced on Sunday night, failed to convince spooked investors concerned about another meltdown in the global banking system, with 129 points shaved off the value of the 100 biggest firms listed in the UK.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 250 was also down 1 per cent, with banking stocks across the two indexes slumping by 5.3 per cent.</p>
      <p>By 2pm in London, the FTSE 100 was around 0.6 per cent higher for the session, with early session gains seen also on the Dow Jones and S&P 500 on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, market worries continued to particularly hit other banking stocks, which led the fallers in London and Europe’s other key markets.</p>
      <p>The recent collapse of US-headquartered Silicon Valley Bank has continued to send shockwaves through the banking sector, bringing back grim memories of the 2008 financial crash which had major implications for economies across the globe.</p>
      <p>Regulators in Washington - and in London, where SVB had a UK division - stepped in to guarantee customer deposits in the failed tech lender but the moves have so far failed to calm market jitters.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse, founded in 1856 and which had managed more than £1 trillion in assets, has had troubles for years but appears to have been tipped over the age by SVB’s collapse.</p>
      <p>It was hoped that the sale of the Swiss bank - the country’s second-biggest lender and viewed by some analysts as ‘too important to fail’ - would calm anxieties in the markets but there was no evidence of that on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Markets in Asia were struggling earlier in the morning, with shares in Hong Kong falling by more than 3 per cent as the banking sector took a battering.</p>
	    <p>“With Credit Suisse shareholders and some bondholders taking a huge hit, banks in Asia have taken a hit on similar concerns about (some of their) bond-holding values,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.</p>
	    <p>“While the weekend deal still presents the Swiss National Bank and Swiss Government with untold headaches, with the size of the newly merged bank set to dwarf the size of the Swiss economy.</p>	
	    <p>“The phrase too big to fail really does spring to mind here, and this morning’s weakness in Asia markets serves to reinforce concerns about these types of writedowns and any spillover effects on the rest of the banking sector.”</p>	
	    <p>The Credit Suisse deal was announced on Sunday evening, as UBS agreed to pay around £2.7 billion for its former rival. The deal was brokered by the same Swiss regulators which had on Wednesday said they would lend up to £45 billion to Credit Suisse to keep it afloat.</p>
      <p>“Having come off the worst week for European equity markets this year, volatility looks set to continue this week now that the fate of Credit Suisse appears to have finally been sealed,” Mr Hewson said.</p>
      <p>UBS’s merger was welcomed internationally, with the US Federal Reserve and Treasury saying Switzerland had moved to “support financial stability”. British chancellor Jeremy Hunt and the Bank of England have also hailed the deal.</p>
      <p>The 167-year-old Credit Suisse was brought to the brink of financial calamity last week despite a £45bn emergency loan from Switzerland’s central bank.</p>
      <p>The deal was made in tandem with six major central banks, including the Bank of England, taking coordinated action to boost dollar flows to help stem the crisis of confidence gripping more lenders.</p>
      <p>The so-called swap line arrangement, involving the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, Bank of Canada and Swiss National Bank (SNB) aimed to "enhance the provision of liquidity" and the "smooth functioning of US dollar funding markets".</p>
      <p>It was hoped that the seven-day-a-week facility, which is due to run until at least the end of April, will be enough to bolster market confidence over the health of other banks, particularly US regional lenders.</p>
      <p>Switzerland said the Credit Suisse deal, which was essentially forced on UBS, was aimed at shoring up confidence in the market.</p>
      <p>UBS’s own shares took a 12 per cent hit in the aftermath of the deal. Deutsche Bank was down 10 per cent, Barclays fell 6 per cent and Lloyds saw a tumble of 4 per cent.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse employs around 5,500 people in the UK, but authorities here were keen to stress on Sunday that the country’s financial system is still safe.</p>
      <p>The Bank of England said: "We welcome the comprehensive set of actions set out by the Swiss authorities today in order to support financial stability.</p>
      <p>"We have been engaging closely with international counterparts throughout the preparations for today’s announcements and will continue to support their implementation.</p>
      <p>"The UK banking system is well capitalised and funded, and remains safe and sound."</p>
      <p>UBS said job losses were expected at Credit Suisse’s UK office after the historic sale of the Swiss bank, with an impact on the lender’s British workers seen as being “inevitable”.</p>
      <p>The former chief executive of UBS in the UK, Mark Yallop, said he thinks job losses will be “inevitable” as a result of the merger and chopping down the investment bank.</p>
      <p>He told the BBC’s Today programme: “The two firms together employ about 120,000 staff, of which about 11,000 sit in London, and I think it’s inevitable that a merger of this sort will result in some further job losses.</p>
      <p>“I would imagine those would be concentrated in the risky investment banking business at Credit Suisse which is partly the cause of the problems the firms is experiencing.</p>
      <p>“And in middle-office, technology and operational roles where bringing two firms together will mean you can run one bigger firm, without doubling up the infrastructure needed to manage it.”</p>

    	<p>(Reuters) - Gold prices retreated from their highest level in a year in volatile trading on Monday, as share markets and Treasury yields bounced back on central banks' efforts to shore up confidence in the financial sector.</p>	
    	<p>Spot gold dipped 0.5% to $1,977.18 per ounce by 1:57 p.m. EDT (1757 GMT), after sliding over 1%, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to settle at $1,982.80.</p>	
    	<p>Earlier in the session, prices of the yellow metal had climbed 1% to their highest since March 2022 at $2,009.59, just shy of a record set during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>"While emergency efforts are being done... now you're seeing that this is far from over. Safe-haven flows are fairly going to be the key trade," Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said.</p>
      <p>In an effort to help the banking sector, top central banks moved on Sunday to bolster the flow of cash around the world.</p>
      <p>Benchmark Treasury yields rose close to their session highs, while equities bounced back on the rescue of Credit Suisse which helped calm some jitters around a bigger banking crisis. [.N] [US/]</p>
      <p>Gold prices have rallied more than $100 after the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"Today's rejection above $2,000 may trigger some profit-taking, but in our opinion not a change in direction," Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note, adding he maintains a bullish outlook on gold.</p>
      <p>Bullion is considered a safe-haven asset during financial uncertainty, and lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding bullion, making it more attractive.</p>
      <p>A key U.S. central bank policy announcement is due on Wednesday. Market participants are mixed on the Federal Reserve's decision, while bets for a rate-hike pause have increased.</p>
      <p>Spot silver fell 0.4% to $22.50 per ounce, platinum firmed 1.1% at $986.27, and palladium dipped 0.5% to $1,413.08.</p>

	    <p>After wild swings, gold showed a strong rebound last week. SPDR Gold Shares GLD added more than 4% last week and 7.3% past month. The subdued U.S. dollar and a decline in U.S. treasury bond yields bolstered the demand for the yellow metal. Additionally, the demand for inflation hedge and growing recession fears are driving investors toward gold, as it is considered a safe haven.</p>
    	<p>As such, gold ETF rallied over the last week with GraniteShares Gold Trust BAR, iShares Gold Trust IAU, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Strategy ETF IAUF, and Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF SGOL gaining about 5% each.</p>	
    	<h3>Factors Driving Gold Price</h3>
      <p>The combination of factors is acting as a catalyst for gold price. Wall Street has been witnessing high volatility lately due to failures of regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank. While First Republic Bank secured a $30 billion rescue package from other big banks, its fate is still unclear.</p>	
    	<p>The crisis spread to the global market. And European banking behemoth Credit Suisse is also operating at the edge. The flagship Swiss lender's shares nosedived on fears of a debt default. Finally, UBS has purchased the struggling Credit Suisse for more than $3 billion in a historic deal. Such crisis has every reason for a flight to safety, which has bolstered the demand for safe haven asset gold.</p>
      <p>In fact, other safe assets like U.S. treasuries gained too, dragging down bond yields. As U.S. treasury yields dropped last week, the greenback has lost its strength. The U.S. benchmark treasury yield started the month at 4.01%, hit a high of 4.08% and ended last week at 3.39%. Traders expect the Fed to raise its benchmark lending rate this week but by a smaller margin of a 25 bps. A decline in bond yields went in favor of non-interest-paying assets like gold.</p>
      <p>If the pace of Fed rate hike slows, the U.S. dollar is likely to decline ahead. If the greenback falls, gold prices will gain as the metal is priced in the U.S. dollar. Moreover, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the East Europe and tensed relationship between United States and China may boost the safe-haven status of gold.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>The gold’s rally from here depends on the Fed’s behavior and the government’s ability to tackle the banking crisis. If the U.S. economic growth slows materially, jobs market suffers and the banking crisis deepens, the Fed will likely be staying put in the coming months. This would be a good new for gold investing. Gold investors should closely watch the economic and market events before taking any decision.</p>

	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- Gold slipped after earlier rising above $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year as a deal to buy Credit Suisse Group AG failed to fully ease fears over the global banking sector.</p>
	    <p>The haven earlier rose as much as 1% despite regulators worldwide rushing to shore up market confidence over the weekend. The ongoing banking woes are also spurring bets that central banks may embark on a slower pace of monetary tightening.</p>	
	    <p>Read More: UBS to Buy Credit Suisse in $3 Billion Deal to Fight Crisis</p>	
	    <p>Bullion surged 6.5% last week in its biggest advance since early on in the pandemic after several regional American lenders collapsed and concerns grew over the Swiss bank’s health.</p>
      <p>“The treatment of AT1 bonds has introduced a new source of uncertainty,” Marcus Garvey, head of metals strategy at Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note. “The longer uncertainty rolls on, with neither market fears being wholly calmed nor a full-blown systematic crisis unfolding, the higher gold prices should be able to trade.”</p>
      <p>It’s a sharp turnaround for bullion, which slid last month on expectations the Federal Reserve would continue its aggressive monetary tightening to curb inflation. Those bets have since been greatly diminished, with swaps traders now split on whether the central bank will hike again this year.</p>
      <p>That’s a boon for non-yielding gold, and investors have responded by increasing their allocations to the market. In tonnage terms, exchange-traded fund holdings of the metal rose the most since April last week, according to an initial tally by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>All eyes will now shift to the Fed’s two-day meeting that culminates Wednesday, “where the outcome is going to be the most difficult to predict in years,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. A shift to a more dovish outlook from policymakers at a time when inflation remains hot could push gold even higher.</p>
      <p>Spot gold fell 0.5% to $1,978.64 an ounce as of 12:20 p.m. in New York, after earlier climbing as high as $2,009.73. The last time bullion traded above the $2,000 mark was in March 2022. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was 0.4% lower. Silver and palladium dropped, while platinum gained.</p>
      <p>Copper traded on the London Metal Exchange advanced as risk appetite improved moderately. Most other base metals were higher.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Many commodities remained under pressure in the wake of UBS Group AG’s emergency purchase of Credit Suisse Group AG that aims to contain a banking crisis hurting the appeal of risk assets.</p>
      <p>Oil sank, with the US benchmark plunging below $65 a barrel to the lowest since late 2021. Grains fell and European gas hit the lowest in more than 1 1/2 years, though copper rose amid a mixed session for industrial metals. Gold — which benefited from the banking turmoil with a 6.5% surge last week — eased after topping $2,000 an ounce for the first time in a year on haven demand.</p>
	    <p>After reaching a record last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Bloomberg Commodities Spot Index has dropped by more than a quarter as concerns over a global slowdown, higher interest rates, and a huge selloff in natural gas dragged the gauge lower. The upheaval in the banking sector — marked by the swift collapse of several US lenders and subsequent crisis at Credit Suisse — then deepened the rout, although bullion was a beneficiary.</p>
	    <p>With a crisis of confidence threatening to spread across financial markets, the Swiss government brokered the deal for Credit Suisse over the weekend, including a guarantee for potential losses from the assets UBS is taking over. The Federal Reserve and five other central banks also announced coordinated action to boost liquidity in US dollar swap arrangements to ease strains in the financial system.</p>	
	    <p>Following those efforts, financial markets came under further pressure early Monday before equities started to fare better.</p>	
	    <p>“When banking suffers then credit suffers and then the economy suffers,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB. “So less optimism on economic growth is warranted.”</p>
      <p>The trajectory for raw materials this week will mostly hinge on how the Credit Suisse deal is received, as well as on the outcome of the Fed’s rate decision on Wednesday. Although US policy makers had signaled their willingness to raise rates by 50 basis points to contain still-hot inflation before the banking crisis erupted, market watchers now expect a smaller increase, or perhaps even a pause.</p>
      <p>The worries over the banking sector have prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — one of the most bullish banks on crude — to trim its forecasts, with the lender no longer seeing prices at $100 in the year ahead. That’s even with it now expecting OPEC producers to only increase output in the third quarter of 2024, rather than in the second half of 2023.</p>
      <p>Oil Spread Slumps Most Since January in Latest Sign of Weakness</p>
      <p>“Participants are still not fully convinced on whether recent moves by authorities can backstop further banking fallouts,” said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte in Singapore. Investors are now wondering whether to buy the dip, Yeap said.</p>
      <p>Bullion’s Appeal</p>
      <p>Gold’s jump last week was its biggest since the early days of the pandemic. Heading into the latest banking crisis, precious metals were dramatically under-owned after a big selloff in February, said Ole Sloth Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. A shift to a more dovish outlook from Fed policy makers would benefit non-yielding bullion.</p>
      <p>In other commodities, iron ore fell after Chinese regulators renewed warnings to companies against hoarding and price gouging in response to a recent surge in the steel-making material. Wheat retreated after the renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to ship rains and other crops from key Black Sea ports, although there was uncertainty over the length of the agreement.</p>

	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- Global coal consumption will likely peak by next year as economics and climate strategies shift the world toward cleaner energy, but several wild cards could determine how long the dirtiest fossil fuel persists, according to BloombergNEF.</p>
	    <p>Coal power generation increased in each of the past two years as China and India battled electricity shortages and Europe tried to replace Russian natural gas. BNEF modeled two scenarios — a purely economic one and one driven by policies to reach net zero emissions by 2050 — both of which see demand rise to a record next year before declining.</p>	
	    <p>Under both scenarios there are several wild cards that could affect how slowly or rapidly use of the fossil fuel declines. These include stronger-than-expected power demand, social backlash against the loss of mining jobs and lobbying from plant owners. China’s clean energy policies, economic support for poorer nations’ energy transitions and prices are other key factors.</p>	
	    <p>BloombergNEF sees coal use persisting through the middle of the century even under strong net zero policies, where demand in the power sector would fall about 70% from its 2024 peak to 1.5 billion tons a year and require plants equipped with carbon capture systems to keep emissions at bay. That would require massive investments in the technology, which has struggled to prove it can operate commercially at scale.</p>
      <p>Coal production has outpaced demand over the past two years, as top miners China and India lifted output to help battle power shortages. That led to a surge in inventories by the end of 2022, especially in China.</p>
      <p>The report also highlights a rocky road ahead for the seaborne thermal coal trade. While production increased for domestic use in China and India, miners in exporters including Australia and the US have ramped down investments to avoid being stuck with stranded assets. That could create a supply squeeze if demand in importing countries rises.</p>
      <p>“A supply crunch in the seaborne thermal coal market could raise coal prices and make it less competitive in the power sector in coal-importing countries and hence accelerate the fall of coal consumption around the world,” BloombergNEF said in the report.</p>

      <p>The implementation of the long-anticipated Shapella hard fork took place on Ethereum’s Goerli network on March 15. This resulted in a brief pause in Optimism‘s Goerli nodes. Goerli is a network utilized by Ethereum developers for testing purposes. Nevertheless, the Optimism protocol persevered, with its ecosystem flourishing despite the disruption to the Goerli nodes.</p>
	    <h3>Glass half full</h3>
	    <p>The growth of Optimism’s ecosystem is evident in the neck-to-neck competition for its 10th grant cycle. This cycle received a high number of applications, with many developers and applications competing for a grant to build on the network. The incentives to build on Optimism could help the protocol in attracting more developers and users to the network.</p>
	    <p>One of the applicants is a dApp called KyberSwap, which has seen its Optimism-based volumes grow by 9 times over the past year. While Uniswap and Velodrome still hold a lead over KyberSwap in terms of volume, the incentives to build on Optimism are attracting more developers and users to the network.</p>	
	    <p>Another sign of the network’s expansion is the rise in its transaction volume. The same has increased from 159,600 transactions to 269,700 transactions over the last few months.</p>	
	    <p>However, despite this hike, the fees generated by the protocol have declined. This, likely due to greater competition among layer-2 solutions, something that has driven down fees generated by the network.</p>
      <h3>And the state of OP is…</h3>
      <p>Despite the decline in fees, the price of the OP token has continued to rise. This is a sign that investors have faith in the long-term potential of the Optimism network. Coupled with that, the MVRV ratio for OP declined, indicating that most holders would not profit if they sold their holdings. This is a sign that there is low selling pressure on OP at this point.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the long/short difference for the OP token has been highly positive too. This is evidence that many holders are long-term investors who are unlikely to sell their holdings.</p>

      <p>Christine Kim, the Vice President of Research at Galaxy Digital, recently appeared on a podcast hosted by Laura Shin. Kim, who is an experienced Ethereum researcher, shared her thoughts on the highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade and its impact on the network and ETH’s price. </p>
	    <h3>Shanghai upgrade will stress test the network</h3>
	    <p>Ethereum validators have eagerly anticipated the Shanghai upgrade for a while. EIP 4895 is arguably the most-awaited aspect of the upgrade, which will unlock staked Ether and allow its withdrawals. Speaking about the upgrade, Christine Kim noted that the activation of staked ETH withdrawals on Ethereum is a major milestone. According to her, Shanghai and Capella aren’t necessarily different upgrades since they both work towards the same goal of enabling withdrawals of staked ETH. </p>
	    <p>As for the subsequent Capella upgrade, Kim claimed that Capella illustrates the changes that will come to the beacon chain, the consensus layer of Ethereum, while Shanghai illustrates the changes that will come to the execution layer of Ethereum.</p>	
	    <p><b>“When you withdraw your stake, your stake is coming out of the beacon chain, but it’s being moved to an address where you can interact with (it) on the execution layer of Ethereum.”</b></p>	
	    <p>When asked about the impact of the withdrawals of staked Ether on the network, Kim acknowledged that it is a matter of concern, given that there are more than 17.5 million staked ETH at the moment. She agreed that mass withdrawal of staked Ether will stress test the limitations of the network. She also added that withdrawals will impact the incentives, with the network increasing rewards in order to attract validators.</p>
      <ul><li>Liquid staking platforms post Shanghai upgrade</li></ul>
      <p>Given Ethereum’s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, liquid staking platforms have become much more relevant for the network. Christine Kim revealed that Lido finance, the largest liquid staking provider which controls more than a third of the total staked Ether, is currently working towards becoming more decentralized. According to her, this initiative is really important for the health of Ethereum over time.</p>
      <p>Rocketpool is gearing up for an upgrade where instead of validator node operators being required to post 16 ETH, the requirement is being slashed by half to 8 ETH. The liquid staking provider is also exploring other upgrades where the staking requirement can be reduced further for institutional staking providers.</p>
      <p>As for Ethereum’s roadmap, the full focus is on increasing scalability and changing its data structure. In fact, according to the analyst, the roadmap is “very ambitious.”</p>

	    <p>The Value Area High and Low were found at $322.8 and $274.7, respectively. This meant that $304.2 and $274.7 are two levels buyers will be interested in. In fact, a set of Fibonacci retracement levels (yellow) were drawn based on the latest surge too.</p>	
	    <p>It showed the 78,6% retracement level lay at $276.7, which was almost the same level as the VAL. Moreover, the price action from early March showed the $285-$292 region was significant support on the lower timeframes. The RSI crossed over above the neutral 50-level and indicated bullish momentum had taken root. The OBV also recorded gains and could continue higher.</p>	
	    <p>Therefore, longer-term buyers can wait for a retracement into the $285-$292 zone. More risk-averse traders can wait for a positive reaction over three days before looking to buy and trade with the trend.</p>
      <ul><li>Spot CVD surges past February highs in response to demand</li></ul>
      <p>The funding rate had been negative over the last two days, but it has since slowly climbed above into positive territory. This implied long positions were once more dominant in the market – Signs of a possible flip in sentiment.</p>
      <p>The rising spot CVD underlined strong demand, but the Open Interest dipped over the last 48 hours. And yet, the price has appreciated during this time, which is evidence of weakening bullish sentiment.</p>

        <li>The bulls seem to have fronted a recovery on the charts</li>
        <li>CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) fell and could affect bulls’ efforts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the bears have controlled MATIC’s market since mid-February, bulls only gained considerable leverage on 10 March. At the time, while the price action rebounded from $0.943, it has since faced stiff resistance levels.</p>
	    <p>Additionally, Bitcoin [BTC] faced rejection around the $26K zone and dropped below $25K, further undermining the rest of the altcoin’s market recovery in the short-term. However, a retest of BTC’s latest highs could lead the altcoin market into a renewed recovery process.</p>
      <h3>MATIC’s recovery at stake – Can bulls push forward?</h3>
	    <p>MATIC’s drop since mid-February was successfully stopped by the $.9427 support. The support was also crucial in January. Bulls cleared the hurdle at 200-period MA (Moving Average), the 20 EMA (Exponential Moving Average), and the $1.1654-resistance level. At press time, MATIC was struggling to bypass the obstacle at $1.23, partly due to BTC’s price fluctuations.</p>
	    <p>Bulls could attempt to clear the $1.23 hurdle if BTC surges above $25K. A close above the hurdle could push the price towards the overhead resistance of $1.5723, especially if the obstacle at $1.34 is cleared too.</p>	
	    <p>On the contrary, BTC fluctuations could set MATIC into a consolidation range of $1.17 – $1.23 if 20 EMA remains steady. However, MATIC could sink to the new low of $0.943 if bears clear the obstacle at 200 MA ($1.0414).</p>	
	    <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retreated from the oversold territory – Evidence of increased buying pressure over the past few days. However, the Average Directional Index (ADX) slope hadn’t moved north, indicating a weak uptrend direction which should caution bulls.</p>
      <h3>Funding rate was positive, but CVD fell</h3> 
      <p>According to the crypto-derivatives data platform Coinalyze, MATIC’s funding rates have been positive since March 13. It underlined increased demand for MATIC in the derivatives market, which helped bypass the $1.1654-hurdle.</p>
      <p>However, the CVD (cumulative volume delta) fell with a negative slope, indicating sellers were gaining leverage in the market. If the CVD was flat, it would mean neither buyers nor sellers had absolute leverage. On the contrary, a positive slope and growth would suggest buyers’ greater market influence. The negative slope, therefore, could complicate the recovery.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Social sentiment in connection with Cardano has begun to rise</li>
        <li>Project’s TVL also hiked while its founder pushed for a bank-free crypto-sector</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cardano [ADA], the decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, has put up with consistent neglect by folks in the crypto-channel. The lack of attention given to the network might be surprising though, especially as the ecosystem reacted positively to recent crises in the industry.</p>
	    <h3>An escape route for the fallen</h3>
	    <p>However, according to on-chain data, Cardano’s struggles are not really a recent matter. In fact, Santiment data revealed that social dominance has hit severe rock bottom repeatedly since 26 February.</p>
	    <p>Social dominance gauges the percentage of discussions around an asset among the top-100 per market capitalization. However, the project’s image seems to be on its way to redemption as the metric hit 2.687% on 14 March. Despite its modest decrease at the time of writing, the condition confirmed that Cardano’s mentions across socials had become mainstream.</p>	
	    <p>While the aforementioned proved that sentiment might be changing, the development activity had a reading of 85.26. This metric detects the improvements in a project’s network and commitment to its core fixes. </p>	
	    <p>At press time, Cardano’s Development Activity did not measure very highly. Instead, it fell slightly but remained around the zone it has occupied since March began. This implied that there has been no notable demand for upgrades on Cardano.</p>
      <p>Another metric that could ignite recognition for ADA is whale activity. According to Santiment, Cardano transactions in the $100,000 to $1 million range have been hitting several highs since January. In fact, at the time of writing, a hundred ADA $100,000 transactions had taken place already on 15 March.</p>
      <p>These values describe a “buy the dip” situation. However, there is no confirmation that ADA’s current value is close to its bottom. Even so, consistent action could drive retail interest and possibly, rekindle the neglect that Cardano has been facing. </p>
      <h3>More deposits, but there’s a need for independence</h3>
      <p>Looking at its Total Value Locked (TVL), Cardano gained by 188.01% over the last 30 days. TVL measures the total value of all crypto-assets staked or locked up in a protocol. Interestingly, the hike also helped Cardano jump into the top-20 chains per TVL.</p>
      <p>An assessment of the information provided by DeFi Llama showed that the milestone would have been impossible if not for the contribution of Aada, Miniswap, and its algorithmic stablecoin – Djed.</p>
      <p>However, this does not automatically assure us that its recently-acquired escape from disregard would last.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the project’s founder Charles Hoskinson weighed in on the problems facing the U.S. banking industry. Hoskinson noted that the crypto-sector needs to re-assess its attachment to traditional financial institutions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>FET hit a key price rejection level </li>
        <li>Bulls can be hopeful because of rising Mean Coin Age and favorable sentiment </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fetch [FET] oscillated around $0.371 – $0.490 over the last few days before breaking below the range. However, bulls found steady ground at $0.298 on March 12, pushing the price back into its previous range only to face rejection at the range’s upper boundary. </p>
	    <p>At press time, the AI-focused token’s value was $0.4310, down 10% in the last 24 hours. However, FET could benefit from a renewed AI narrative.</p>
      <p>OpenAI released its latest and advanced ChatGPT-4 as a Google-backed Anthropic also rolled out a “safer” rival AI chatbot called Claude. This marked a renewal of the AI-wars that could boost AI-focused tokens like Fetch [FET], as seen in the past trend. </p>
      <h3>Will the price ceiling at 61.8% Fib level hold any longer?</h3>
	    <p>After price rejection at $0.61, FET retraced and entered a consolidation range (white, dotted), but broke below it. The drop was checked by the $0.23-support, thrusting FET into a strong recovery. The 61.8% Fib level hurdle could be cleared as AI narrative floods socials in the next few hours.</p>
	    <p>Therefore, FET could surge to the bearish order block and 78.6% Fib level of $0.5423 or to overhead resistance at $0.6089 if it closes above the 50% Fib level ($0.4533). Such a move could offer two possible trades. </p>	
	    <p>First, a risky approach targeting the 78.6% Fib level ($0.5423). The entry will be above $0.4533 with a stop loss at 23.6% Fib level ($0.3711). The second option is a $0.6089-target with similar entry and stop loss levels. Each will offer an RR of 1:2.5 and 1:4, respectively. </p>	
	    <p>On the other hand, a close below 23.6% Fib level (($0.3711) would invalidate the bullish thesis. If the previous support holds again, the drop could offer new buying opportunities at $0.30. Short-sellers can short the asset if it closes below $0.3711 and repurchases it cheaply at $0.30.</p>
      <p>The RSI (Relative Strength Index) rose, but was slightly above equilibrium, showing buying pressure reduced significantly. However, rising OBV (On Balance Volume) could boost further uptrend. </p>
      <h3>FET saw rising Mean Coin Age and greater positive sentiment</h3>
      <p>FET recorded a rising 90-day Mean Coin Age, indicating a wide-network accumulation – A potential rally signal. Similarly, the weighted sentiment exhibited a highly positive elevation, showing investors were bullish on the token. </p>
      <p>Worth noting that the spike in supply on exchanges is a sign of short-term selling pressure. This, however, is unlikely to undermine a long-term recovery. </p>

        <li>USDC regained its peg after Circle moved quickly with new banking partners.</li>
        <li>USDC demonstrated signs of demand and volume recovery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Circle faced its toughest week so far this year after USD Coin [USDC] lost its dollar peg. It has since recovered, but the stablecoin issuer just released a new update regarding its USDC operations.</p>
      <p>According to the update, Circle redeemed 2.9 billion USDC and minted 700 million USDC on 14 March. Those efforts were part of its action plan to aid the peg recovery. More importantly, Circle announced that it was securing new transaction banking partners. The company’s goal is to facilitate round-the-clock transactions that will not be limited by regular banking hours.</p>
      <p>Circle further revealed that it had limited funds held by its transaction banking partners to support redemption and minting. It also revealed that it held a cash position of its reserve at BNY Mellon. Thus, at press time, it had on-ramps for users looking to move their funds into the crypto segment.</p>
      <p>The move by Circle underscored plans to bypass regulators’ efforts to prevent banks from working with crypto companies. It also came just days after multiple banks collapsed, adding more pressure to the fiat system. As a result, more people were losing their trust in the fiat system, and this was a key factor that fueled the rally in the last three days.</p>      
      <h3>USDC volumes are recovering</h3>
	    <p>The aforementioned factors and the fact that USDC has regained its test have restored some confidence back into the stablecoin. The supply of USDC in smart contracts recently bounced back to a new four-month high.</p>
	    <p>But what about actual market demand? Well, a look at address characteristics revealed that USDC receiving addresses were slightly higher than sending addresses. Another key observation is that both metrics dropped substantially since 11 March, as people moved to other stablecoins.</p>	
	    <p>However, addresses began leveling out at press time, suggesting that USDC trading activity is recovering. This is evident in the stablecoin’s exchange flows. Both exchange inflows and outflows have been on the rise for the last three days after previously tanking because of the depeg.</p>	
	    <p>The exchange outflows remain higher than inflows, hence confirming that USDC is yet to regain full confidence. This may also be due to the recent crypto rally, which meant that investors have been buying crypto for stablecoins.</p>

        <li>MakerDAO’s RWA holdings led to profits amid stablecoin market issues.</li>
        <li>Protocol maintains stability but faces a decline in unique users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The stablecoin market faced a significant challenge as USD Coin [USDC] came under scrutiny. MakerDAO, the protocol behind stablecoin DAI, also felt the impact. But despite this, MakerDAO saw profits, thanks to its RWA holdings.</p>
	    <p>According to data provided by Delphi Digital, MakerDAO made a $3.8 million profit through its RWA holdings. These holdings contribute significantly to MakerDAO’s overall earnings, making up 11.6% of its total holdings. Real World Asset (RWA) is a type of collateral that is not cryptocurrency-based but is more traditional and tangible, such as U.S. Treasury Bills and Bonds.</p>
      <h3>Having a closer look</h3>
	    <p>However, MakerDAO’s PnL statement painted a negative outlook due to high expenses on upgrades and updates. A significant portion of MakerDAO’s earnings are possibly being spent on upgrading and maintaining the protocol. These expenses outweighed their earnings, leading to a net loss for MakerDAO.</p>
	    <p>Nonetheless, MakerDAO’s recent proposal to create PSM circuit breakers shows its dedication to improving its protocols, considering the market’s volatility. This proposal will allow Maker governance to disable a PSM immediately without governance delay. This step will ensure that the protocol can react quickly to market changes and maintain stability.</p>	
	    <p>The state of the protocol was relatively healthy as the volume on MakerDAO increased by 55% over the past month. This shows that despite the challenges faced by the stablecoin market, MakerDAO has maintained its momentum.</p>	
	    <p>However, the number of unique users in the same period declined by 14% according to Messari’s data. This decline has affected the overall TVL generated by MakerDAO, leading to a decline over the past few days.</p>
      <h3>MKR and DAI</h3>
      <p>Along with a decline in TVL, MKR token’s prices declined.</p>
      <p>However, whale interest in the token skyrocketed. This interest from whales could be due to the fact that the market cap of DAI increased materially over the last few days. This interest in both MKR and DAI indicated the potential for future profits and belief in the long-term viability of the protocol.</p>

        <li>The launch was flagged off through regulatory approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</li>
      </ul>
	    <p>On 15 March, Coinbase announced that it had secured a partnership with TradFi giant Standard Chartered. This move undermined recent directives by regulators aiming to prevent the flow of liquidity into the crypto market.</p>
	    <p>Crypto regulators issued a directive to U.S banks in February, requiring them not to engage in business with crypto companies. However, Coinbase moved forward nonetheless. According to a recent announcement, the partnership will provide a free on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto users in Singapore.</p>	
	    <p>Coinbase also revealed that it updated its help center so that it can offer learning material for over 200 crypto assets. This is a surprising change of pace for Singapore users because regulators in the country previously criticized cryptocurrencies.</p>	
	    <h3>Are CEXes shifting its focus outside the U.S.?</h3>
      <p>The Coinbase announcement came at a time when the U.S. market has been facing economic turmoil due to inflation and a recent banking crisis. On top of that, the U.S. appears to be taking an aggressive stance against the crypto market.</p>
      <p>This new development underscores Coinbase’s push into other promising markets outside the U.S. Singapore is one of those markets that has also been embracing opportunities in the blockchain and crypto space. The exchange plans to leverage the Singpass platform, which is native to Singapore, part of the conduit for its crypto offerings.</p>
      <h3>Coinbase secures regulatory approval from Singaporean authorities</h3>
      <p>Coinbase announced through its official blog that its foray into Singapore is just the start of its global expansion. Part of the reason the Asian country is among the first international targets for Coinbase is regulatory approval. Coinbase is now allowed to offer regulated Digital Payment Token (DPT) services through in-principal approval. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) offered the approval.</p>
      <p>The regulatory path underscores Singapore’s favorable stance for the crypto market. This theme has reverberated across multiple jurisdictions in the Asian region and even in some European countries. Numerous other countries may follow in Singapore’s footsteps, especially now that the crypto market is maturing. FOMO will be the key driver as more countries play catchup to avoid missing out on opportunities.</p>

	    <p>BEIJING (AP) — European shares advanced Thursday following a retreat in Asia after Credit Suisse said it would borrow up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank to shore up its finances, possibly easing worries about a bank crisis following the failure of two U.S. lenders.</p>
	    <p>London, Frankfurt and Wall Street futures gained. Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong declined as Asian bank stocks slid, reversing Wednesday's gains. Oil prices rose.</p>	
	    <p>Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 lost 0.7% on Wednesday after Credit Suisse shares fell 30%. That fueled jitters about global banks that are under strain following interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to cool inflation.</p>	
	    <p>“Expect confidence to remain fragile,” Chris Turner, Francesco Pesole and Frantisek Taborsky of ING said in a report.</p>
      <p>The turmoil over banks will complicate a European Central Bank decision due to be announced Thursday about another possible interest rate hike, they said. It is “casting doubts on whether policymakers will raise rates at all,” they said.</p>
      <p>In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London gained 1.4% to 7,447.53. The DAX in Frankfurt jumped 1.7% to 14,988.39 and the CAC 40 in Paris added 1.7% to 6,999.23. The Swiss Market index was up 1.2%.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, the future for the benchmark S&P 500 index was up 0.1%. That for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Dow lost 0.9% and the Nasdaq composite closed up 0.1%.</p>
      <p>In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo retreated 0.8% to 27,010.61. Mizuho Bank was down 3.9%, while Resona Holdings, a major second-tier bank, lost 4.8%.</p>
      <p>The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 1.7% to 19,203.91. Standard Chartered Plc lost 5.4% and HSBC was 2.4% lower.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.1% to 3,226.89 after government data Wednesday showed the Chinese economy is recovering more slowly than expected following the lifting of anti-virus controls.</p>
      <p>Search engine Baidu's share price plunged 10% and eventually closed down 6.4% in Hong Kong after the company unveiled its rival to the Microsoft-backed ChatGPT in a pre-recorded rather than a live presentation.</p>
      <p>China's banks don't face the same pressures as foreign lenders because Beijing has held its benchmark lending rate steady since mid-2022 and keeps the country sealed off from global capital flows. State-owned Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Ltd. and Bank of China, Ltd. were up 0.1%.</p>
      <p>The Kospi in Seoul was off less than 0.1% at 2,377.91 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 sank 1.5% to 6,965.50.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse has been fighting troubles for years, including losses from the 2021 collapse of investment firm Archegos Capital.</p>
      <p>Its share price plunge reignited worries about the global industry after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed in the second- and third-biggest U.S. bank failures in history.</p>
      <p>On Wall Street, bank stocks plunged Monday, recovered Tuesday and tumbled again Wednesday.</p>
      <p>First Republic Bank sank 21.4%, a day after soaring 27%. JPMorgan Chase slid 4.7%.</p>
      <p>Banks are struggling after the Federal Reserve's fastest series of rate hikes in decades caused prices of assets on their balance sheets to decline.</p>
      <p>Stress in the financial system could push the Fed to hold off on hiking rates at its meeting next week or at least refrain from the larger rate hike it had been potentially signaling. But inflation at 6% in February still is well above the Fed's 2% target.</p>
      <p>Weaker-than-expected economic reports released Wednesday may have allayed some of those worries.</p>
      <p>One showed that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by much more last month than economists expected. It’s still high at a 4.6% level versus a year earlier, but that was better than the 5.4% that was forecast.</p>
      <p>Other data showed that U.S. spending at retailers fell by more than expected last month. Such data could raise worries about a recession on the horizon, but they may also take some pressure off inflation in the near term.</p>
      <p>In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $68.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plummeted $3.72 on Wednesday to $67.61. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading advanced $1.05 cents to $74.74 per barrel in London. It lost $3.76 to $73.69 the previous session.</p>
      <p>The dollar declined to 132.87 yen from Wednesday's 133.46 yen. The euro gained to $1.0615 from $1.0586.</p>

	    <h4>SINGAPORE, March 16 (Reuters) -</h4>
	    <p>Markets took a moment's respite on Thursday after Credit Suisse said it would borrow as much as 50 billion francs ($53.7 billion) from the Swiss central bank to steady itself, but trade was very tense as investors worried where banking stress might show up next.</p>
	    <p>Asian shares fell but without the frenzied drops seen overnight in Europe. European futures were last up 2%, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.5%.</p>	
	    <p>Any relief was tinged with fear of what may go wrong next.</p>	
	    <p>A week ago a start-up lender in California failed and now a systemic bank in one of Europe's financial capitals is in enough trouble to seek authorities' help. Credit Suisse shares dropped 24% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Safe assets like bonds, gold and dollars were in favour.</p>
      <p>"I think we're getting into the hard hat territory again," said Damian Rooney, a dealer at Perth stockbroker Argonaut.</p>
      <p>"The word contagion is knocking about...we're getting fear across the whole board here," he said. "The trouble is with the unwinding - you don't know what you don't know."</p>
      <p>MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1% to its lowest this year. Japan's bank shares recovered some even deeper early losses, but were last down 4% and the Nikkei dropped 1.3%.</p>
      <p>Insurers, banks, miners and consumer stocks were among the biggest losers across Asia's markets as worries grow that a potential credit crunch can worsen a looming economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>Selling pressure eased for commodities and buying in gold, bonds and dollars backed off but without really recovering any of the losses in growth-exposed assets or handing back much of the astonishing gains that have been seen in bond markets.</p>
      <p>Bonds have soared while markets have radically re-priced the interest rate outlook, betting central banks will be quickly cutting rates while stability fears rattle the financial system.</p>
      <p>Two-year U.S. Treasuries are eying their best week since 1987 and yields, which fall when prices rise, are down more than 66 basis points since Friday.</p>
      <p>An index of bond market volatility - the ICE BofA MOVE index - has hit its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>'SOMETHING UGLY'</p>
      <p>The European Central Bank's meeting later on Thursday looms as a big test of the bond rally, as the first scheduled policy announcement since bank jitters began in the U.S. last week.</p>
      <p>ECB policymakers had flagged a 50 basis point hike and President Christine Lagarde was just this month saying it was very likely. But market pricing implies just a 10% chance of that happening now and traders are on edge about the outcome.</p>
      <p>"We've got to get through ECB and see how that goes down. And then the impact of that may well impact on what we think about the Fed next week," said ING economist Rob Carnell.</p>
      <p>"I think it's going to be a very volatile period until we get this out of the way...it feels like at these interest rate levels the risk of finding that you've lifted a stone and something ugly is underneath gets higher."</p>
      <p>The euro and Swiss franc found some support from the central bank's help for Credit Suisse, steadying after steep overnight drops.</p>
      <p>The euro last stood at $1.0601 and the franc at 0.9300 to the dollar. The flight to safety lent support to the yen and it rose about 0.5% to 132.75 per dollar.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand dollar fell 0.4% to $0.6161 after growth data missed forecasts.</p>
      <p>($1 = 0.9310 Swiss francs) ($1 = 0.9301 Swiss francs)</p>

	    <h3><strong>Yen Demand Catapults as Banking Crisis Wrecks US, Europe Havens</strong></h3>
      <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Bloomberg) -- The yen is making a push to regain its crown as the go-to haven as a banking crisis dents the appeal of its US and European peers.</p>
	    <p>Japan’s currency has outperformed all its Group-of-10 counterparts in the past five days as traders sought the safest assets amid a surge in volatility. In contrast, a gauge of the dollar sank 0.7% in the immediate aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse while the Swiss franc dropped as much as 2% Wednesday.</p>	
	    <p>“The yen is being seen as a safe haven again, and there appear to be very few of those at the moment,” said Andrew Ticehurst, a rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Sydney. “With SVB impacting the US dollar as Fed rate hikes get put in doubt, and Credit Suisse impacting ECB thinking and the euro and Swiss franc outlook, the yen can buck the trend.”</p>	
	    <p>The turmoil in the banking sector is reshaping the outlook for monetary tightening, as investors speculate that the crisis may stay the hand of central banks. Upcoming policy reviews by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are the next event risk, with some investors warning that authorities may continue to tighten to tame inflation.</p>
      <p>The expected peak for the Fed policy rate — which exceeded 5.5% less than a week ago — is down to about 4.85%, pricing in an increase in May, with a quarter-point hike at next week’s review deemed a coin toss. Traders see the ECB opting for a quarter-point increase on Thursday, compared with expectations for a half-point hike last week.</p>
      <p>Analysts are similarly less enthused about the franc as the currency’s fortunes are seen to be closely linked to those of troubled lender Credit Suisse Group AG. The bank is seeking funding from the Swiss National Bank to shore up investor confidence and Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Koerner has said its financial position is sound.</p>
      <p>“The yen seems more popular now than the Swiss franc, which is another safe currency, due to the emergence of the Credit Suisse issue,” said Ayako Sera, strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “Safety is the key word in the market right now.”</p>
      <p>Surplus Challenges</p>
      <p>Still, Japan’s currency has several factors working against it. For one, the nation would probably require overseas money to help fund a record current-account deficit, and this may expose the yen to volatile foreign flows.</p>
      <p>Japan’s ultra-low rates are another worry, and any further Fed tightening may widen the rate gap and unleash another wave of selling in the yen.</p>
      <p>But until that happens, Japan’s currency looks likely to continue attracting buyers for now, strategists said.</p>
      <p>“We see recent developments as USD bearish,” Patrick Bennett, strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, wrote in a note. He forecasts dollar-yen falling to 123 in the third quarter from around 133 now.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
	    <p>(Reuters) -Credit Suisse Group AG said on Thursday it intended to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank in what it called "decisive action" to boost its liquidity.</p>
	    <p>The planned move came after Swiss regulators pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse in an unprecedented move by a central bank after the flagship Swiss lender's shares fell by as much as 30% on Wednesday.</p>	
	    <p>"Credit Suisse is taking decisive action to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity by intending to exercise its option to borrow from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) up to CHF 50 billion under a Covered Loan Facility as well as a short-term liquidity facility, which are fully collateralized by high quality assets," Credit Suisse said in a statement.</p>	
	    <p>It pointed to its end-2022 Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.1% and average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 144%. The latter had improved to about 150% by March 14, it said.</p>
      <p>Referring to the intended borrowing, it said: "This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs."</p>
      <p>The collapses in the U.S. of Silicon Valley Bank last week and Signature Bank two days later have sent global bank stocks on a rollercoaster ride.</p>
      <p>Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank, said investors might be worried about Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse for different reasons, but both suffered from the side effect of high-interest rates.</p>
      <p>"The underlying economic stress may emerge more frequently ... and it is possible to see more black swans in an uncertain environment," he said.</p>
      <p>The Swiss lender's latest move came after CEO Ulrich Koerner said in an interview earlier on Wednesday that the bank's "capital, our liquidity basis is very very strong."</p>
      <p>"We fulfill and overshoot basically all regulatory requirements."</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse Group last month reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis after rattled clients pulled billions of dollars from the bank. It warned that a further "substantial" loss would come this year.</p>
      <p>The bank, Switzerland's second biggest, has begun a major overhaul of its business, cutting costs and jobs to revive its fortunes, including creating a separate business for its investment bank under the CS First Boston brand. The bank raised 4 billion Swiss francs from investors in December.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, it also announced offers for senior debt securities for cash of up to 3 billion francs.</p>
      <p>The bank said it had also accelerated cost cuts and was well on track to deliver 2.5 billion francs of cost-base reductions by 2025, including 1.2 billion francs in 2023.</p>

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.15 billion, down 13.96% from the prior-year quarter.</p>	
	    <p>For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.29 per share and revenue of $4.97 billion, which would represent changes of -17.35% and -9.43%, respectively, from the prior year.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin slid below $24,500 as investors weighed a potential European banking meltdown triggered by concerns about often-embattled Credit Suisse.</p>
      <p>The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped to $23,946 at one point before regaining ground to recently trade at $24,502, roughly flat over the 24 hours. But that was still well off BTC's highs of the previous day when it soared past $26,000 after the release of a mildly upbeat consumer price index (CPI) inflation data for February. The 6% CPI improved on the previous month’s reading and offered investors looking for more monetary policy dovishness hope the U.S. Federal Reserve would at least temporarily stop its recent diet of interest rate hikes.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, banking troubles trumped monetary policy considerations.</p>
      <p>Shares of the Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse (CS), which has been rocked by scandals over the past year and posted losses for five consecutive quarters, tanked on Wednesday after the bank’s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it wouldn’t invest capital beyond the $1.5 billion it sank into the bank last year. Saudi National Bank owns a stake of up to 9.9%.</p>
      <p>The Swiss National Bank seemed to at least temporarily halt the damage after announcing it would provide CS with liquidity “if necessary,” and rejecting the notion that contagion tied to the failure of two, large U.S. regional banks over the past week had spread overseas.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse shares tumbled 13%, as did several European banking stocks including French banks BNP Paribas (BNP.PA) and Société Générale (GLE:FP), down by 8% and 10%, respectively. European markets tumbled as investors in riskier assets grew skittish.</p>
      <p>U.S. equity markets initially tumbled on the banking news coming from Europe before recovering some of their losses. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.05%.</p>
      <p>Regional banking stocks also plunged, with First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW) falling 21% and 13%, respectively.</p>
      <p>“Credit Suisse is a bigger story than Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and this has Wall Street extremely nervous,” ​​Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday email. “Bitcoin’s decline isn’t that bad when you consider how much pressure is hitting stocks, oil prices and the euro.”</p>
      <p>While banking turmoil could ultimately become a bullish moment for bitcoin, “for now crypto weakness is justified,” Moya added.</p>
	    <p>Meanwhile, the CME FedWatch Tool showed that currently around 55% of traders believe the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting March 22. An additional 45% expect the Fed to boost the rate by 25 basis points (bps), a stark change from a week ago when an increasing number of observers felt the Fed would increase the rate by 50 bps.</p>
	    <p>Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at technical analysis-based research firm Fairlead Strategies, said BTC's resistance is strong near $25,200, while tackling “intermediate-term overbought conditions in place that have become a headwind."</p>	
	    <p>“This increases short-term downside risk to support from the 200-day [moving average] (~$19,800),” Tamplin told CoinDesk in an email.</p>	
	    <p>Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was hovering around $1,656 Wednesday afternoon, down 2.4% from Tuesday, same time. HNT, the native token of the decentralized wireless communication network Helium, recently tumbled 13% to trade near $2 Wednesday, its lowest level in two months. The decline came after Binance.US said it would delist the cryptocurrency on March 21.</p>
      <p>The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was down roughly 3% for the day.</p>

      <p>Stocks were tumbling—until the Swiss National Bank offered to support  Credit Suisse Group CS –13.94%  if necessary. That news caused the market to bounce and hold an important level of technical support.</p>
	    <p>The day began with Credit Suisse (CS) emerging as the latest bank to be the focus of investor concerns after the Saudi National Bank said it wouldn’t provide more financing. The news, which came after SVB’s collapse, caused the S&P 500 to tumble as much as 2.1%, to 3838.24, Wednesday and to give back nearly all of its year-to-date gains. But news that the Swiss National Bank would help support Credit Suisse caused stocks to bounce off their lows and the S&P 500SPX –0.70%  to close down just 0.7% at 3,891.93.</p>
	    <p>“Bottom line, the introduction of regional bank contagion has altered the market landscape in the short term, and whether those risks settle or increase will determine if stocks stabilize,” writes Sevens Report’s Tom Essaye. </p>	
	    <p>Stabilize they did, and at an important level for the market. For the S&P 500, 3850 has been identified as an important support level for stocks, one, that if it broke, would lead to a further drop to the next support level, near 3700. And if that level were to break, the index could fall to its bear market low of just below 3600. In a worst-case scenario—or at least a bad one—the S&P 500 could fall to 3000, writes John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. </p>	
	    <p>That level would make sense from a fundamental perspective, too. More economic weakness from here—in addition to that created by the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes—would pressure earnings estimates, estimates that already look too high. Analyst’s aggregate 2023 earnings per share forecasts for S&P 500 companies sit at about $221 right now, according to FactSet, just above last year’s $216.</p>
      <p>But if the economy slows, estimates could get reduced to $210 or even lower as the market loses confidence in the economy and corporate earnings power. That alone would put the S&P 500 at about 3640 at a current based on the S&P 500’s current multiple of 17.3 times 12-month forward earnings.</p>
      <p>Declining earnings would likely mean declining valuations, writes Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, perhaps earning the S&P 500 a multiple as low as 14 times. At that level, the index would trade at 2940, down 24% from Wednesday’s close.</p>

	    <h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p><strong>Southern Copper Corporation</strong>SCCO is poised well for growth, backed by its industry-leading copper reserves, focus on increasing low-cost production and ongoing investment in expansion projects. Its cost control measures will help offset the impact of inflated fuel, labor and operating costs.</p>
	    <h3>Output to Pick Up 2023 Onwards</h3>
      <p>In 2022, the company registered a 6.6% year-over-year decline in copper production to 894,703 tons, due to work stoppage at the Cuajone mine as well as lower ore grades. Molybdenum production was 13.3% down to 26,240 tons as a result of lower ore grades at the Toquepala mine. Zinc production was down 10.4% year over year to 60,010 tons due to lower production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara mines. Mined silver production was 18.56 million ounces, down 2.1% from last year. This was mainly due to a decline in production at Peruvian operations and the La Caridad mine which was partially offset by higher production at Buenavista and IMMSA mines.</p>	
	    <p>These numbers are expected to pick up and reach 926,000 tons in 2023. This will be made possible by the Peruvian production coming back on track and new production on projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrators.</p>	
	    <h3>Solid Projects on Track</h3>
      <p>Southern Copper’s total investment program in Peru runs to $7.9 billion, including the Michiquillay ($2.5 billion) and Los Chancas ($2.6 billion) projects. Peru is currently the second-largest producer of copper globally and holds 13% of the world’s copper reserves. Michiquillay is expected to become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will produce 225,000 tons of copper per year for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. Production is expected to commence by 2032.</p>
      <p>The Los Chancas project located in Apurimac, Peru is a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of the concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The project is expected to commence in 2030.</p>
      <p>The company has a number of other projects that are planned to be developed in the future, which will help in attaining its copper volume production target of 1.5 million tons by 2031.</p>
      <h3>Metal Prices to Pick Up in the Long Term</h3>
      <p>Copper prices had been on a downtrend in 2022 amid uncertainties surrounding the global economy, as new coronavirus restrictions in China affected the demand for the red metal, thus hurting prices. Zinc prices also bore the brunt of weak demand worries as COVID lockdowns in China stoked concerns over a global recession. Silver prices had also been negatively impacted, weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and sluggish growth.</p>
      <p>Industrial production in China has lagged expectations for the first two months of this year while political unrest in South America is fueling supply concerns. This has been weighing on copper prices lately.</p>
      <p>The long-term outlook for copper is positive, as copper demand is expected to grow, driven by electric vehicles and renewable energy, and infrastructure investments. Copper prices will be supported by growth in public infrastructure investment in the United States, as well as global initiatives to address climate change.</p>
      <p>Molybdenum prices are set to increase on the back of healthy demand and reduced supply. Long-term fundamentals for zinc remain strong due to its significant industrial consumption. Silver prices will gain eventually, given its industrial use, impending demand-supply imbalance and safe-haven demand.</p>
      <h3>Industry Leading Reserves & Low Cost: A Winning Combination</h3>
      <p>Southern Copper has the largest copper reserves in the industry and operates high-quality, world-class assets in investment-grade countries such as Mexico and Peru. Backed by its constant focus on increasing low-cost production and growth investments, the company is well-poised to continue delivering enhanced performance. Its efforts to lower costs have aided the company to negate the impacts of higher costs for diesel and fuel, operating and repair materials, supplies and energy, as well as higher labor costs.</p>
      <h3>Price Performance</h3>
      <p>The company’s shares have fallen 2.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s 14% growth.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider</h3>
      <p>Southern Copper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics Inc. STLD, Olympic Steel Inc. ZEUS and Nucor Corporation NUE.</p>
      <p>Steel Dynamics currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). STLD’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 11.3% on average. STLD has rallied around 23.2% in a year.</p>
      <p>Olympic Steel currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. ZEUS’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 26.2% on average. ZEUS has rallied around 51.7% in a year.</p>

    	<h3>In this article:</h3>
    	<p>In the case of OPEC, cutting back on oil supplies doesn't do much for boosting prices when demand isn't there.</p>
	    <p>The OPEC put, just like the Fed put, is nothing other than a fallacy, or perhaps wishful thinking at this point. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Brent oil spiked to $130 a barrel plus, money rushed into the oil sector as we heard doom-and-gloom calls about a lack of energy capital spending, running out of spare capacity, and how oil prices would need to be higher for longer to spur that investment.</p>	
	    <p>True as some of those calls may be, commodities don't work that way. They are driven by actual demand and supply at any given time and by the inventory balance. Of course, academics and analysts tend to move their models at extremes to price in the latest scenario. But trading does not care about research-driven models. After all, if we believed research-driven models, Tesla (TSLA) was supposed to trade at $1.500.</p>	
	    <p>It is easy to tweak an Excel model to spit out whatever confirmation bias you may have, or play with the denominator to generate the result one wants to see. Assumptions are very important in any modeling, and that is where the problem lies. Most models get demand entirely wrong.</p>
      <p>After the rout in technology stocks in 2022, most investors parked their money in what they deemed as safe haven assets, such as large-cap equites that showed 4%-5% yield on their balance sheets. But those very same dividend yields are subject to cash flows, and if the top line erodes, so do those cash flows. A stock needs to give an investor the right upside reward potential for the risk the investor takes to invest in that equity. But if US government bonds yielded the same coupon as a risky equity, one would be better suited to be invested in the former.</p>
      <p>Just as we saw in natural gas markets when prices got to as high as 300 euros per megawatt hour and most called for Europe to be sent back to the dark ages, lo and behold, the physical market finds a way as there are entrepreneurs who will find a way to capitalize on these arbitrage opportunities. US liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies did just that as they profited from the massive $10/MMBtu vs. $2/MMBtu differential by sending all their cargoes to Europe as Europe was desperate.</p>
      <p>European gas today is trading below 45 euros per MWh and politicians are still debating energy and gas security. The oil market is slightly different in that we have had OPEC and Russia working together to balance the market, supporting prices so to speak. This only works when the market is tight and you are the only swing producer, i.e. in 2021. But today, demand is not as strong despite China reopening its economy, and there is no need for additional barrels. When demand is weak and supply picks up, there is nothing much that can be done to support prices.</p>
      <p>Oil equity investors held onto their long oil bets all throughout 2022 as they hoped for China's return or Russian barrels to come off the market. Neither has happened. Oil prices are down 50%-plus as analysts who assumed $90 a barrel was the floor for oil are seeing less than $75 a barrel now. One forgets that we were trading below $75 a barrel before Covid.</p>
      <p>The same wishful thinking is heard in the equity market as most retail investors think Fed will come to their rescue as it did in the past decade and start quantitative easing (QE) again. But what the Fed and OPEC have in common is that they never had to deal with a harsh recession and higher inflation at the same time. Both have their hands tied for now, for if they were to either print more money (in the case of Fed) or cut back on supplies (OPEC), it could cause a price surge, but only in the short term, as that would collapse the global economy as we know it, sending it back even worse than the 1970s.</p>

	    <p>HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. is considering selling its majority stake in the Rovigo LNG terminal offshore Italy as part of a strategy to divest from non-core assets, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
	    <p>The terminal, also named, Adriatic LNG, is owned by Exxon's subsidiary ExxonMobil Italiana Gas S.r.l. (70.7%), QatarEnergy subsidiary Qatar Terminal Company Limited (22%) and Snam Spa (7.3%). Snam has the right of first refusal should a partner decide to divest.</p>	
	    <p>Exxon said that while it was verifying market interest, it had not made a decision about a potential sale nor has it identified a buyer at this early stage.</p>	
	    <p>"Tests like this are consistent with our focused investment strategy, highlighting our willingness to divest non-core assets to those who can derive greater value," Exxon spokesperson Meghan Macdonald said.</p>
      <p>Any transaction would not impact Exxon's imports of LNG into the Adriatic LNG terminal, nor its interest in the Italian and European markets as a natural gas supplier, the company said.</p>

        <li>The daily market structure, at press time, was about to flip bullish</li>

      <p>The release of the CPI data was just around the corner, at the time of writing. Ease in inflation is expected, but is this expectation already priced in? Does that explain the recent Bitcoin pump right into a zone of resistance at this critical moment? And, what can that mean for Polkadot traders?</p>
	    <p>Traders can prepare themselves for the bullish and the bearish scenarios. Since DOT is also at a critical inflection point, its next leg is not yet certain. Evidence for the next move can be awaited before assuming positions in the market.</p>
      <h3>The daily bearish breaker is likely to oppose DOT bulls</h3>
	    <p>A former bullish order block, which was flipped to a bearish breaker in early March, was highlighted by the red box. At the time of writing, the price was within this zone, testing it as a zone of supply. Moreover, this area had confluence with the $6.1-level of resistance. Bitcoin was trading just below the $25.2k resistance, which marked the highs of August 2022 and February.</p>
	    <p>If BTC can break out past this resistance, it would signal bullish sentiment across the market. This could prime DOT to climb past the $6.1-level as well. However, a daily session close above the breaker would be required before buyers can look for opportunities to enter long positions. The market structure was on the verge of flipping bullish as well, as the recent lower high at $6.06 from 5 March could be beaten.</p>	
	    <p>On the other hand, if the price sees rejection and falls beneath the $5.75-level, it would be a sign that bears had taken control. Short sellers can thereafter look to short the asset, with a stop-loss above the $6.1-mark. To the south, targets would be the $5.6-level and the March low at $5.15.</p>	
	    <p>The RSI was at neutral 50 at press time, while the A/D line had climbed over the past few weeks to show strong buying pressure. This was another indication that DOT was in a significant area, but it appeared the buyers had an edge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OI indicated participants could be trying to fade the rally</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Funding Rate jumped into positive territory to signal that the sentiment was bullish. However, the 1-hour chart showed a drop in Open Interest over the last 12 hours preceding the time of writing. In this period, the price continued to climb higher.</p>
      <p>This suggested that long positions were discouraged and bearish sentiment began to take hold. And yet, it could be too early to short Polkadot. The reaction of Bitcoin over the next couple of days would show the direction of the market over the coming weeks.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Polkadot has announced the launch of an NFT marketplace by Beatport on Aventus</li>
        <li>Polkadot NFT volume fairly normal as DOT commenced recovery on price charts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Polkadot is making a significant play in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT), and Web 3 arena as the space grows and the link gets deeper. The development of the Internet and how we interact with digital assets are tied to Web3 and NFTs. Polkadot is putting its foot down early with a recent collaboration announcement with Beatport. Needless to say, a favorable effect on DOT may be on the cards too.</p>
	    <h3>The Polkadot partnership with Beatport</h3>
	    <p>NFTs are a crucial application of Web3 technology, enabling the creation and ownership of unique digital assets that can be verified on a blockchain. As the Web 3 ecosystem grows, we expect to see more innovative uses of NFTs and other blockchain-based assets.</p>
	    <p>Polkadot is taking action in this direction by launching an NFT marketplace. The move is part of an initiative to promote electronic music culture to Web3 and is being carried out in conjunction with global music powerhouse Beatport. With the debut of the Beatport marketplace on Polkadot’s sidechain Aventus, record labels and musicians will have a new channel to promote their work and monetize their fan bases.</p>	
	    <h3>Parachains, NFTs, and Polkadot (DOT)</h3>
      <p>Polkadot is a platform for many blockchains to interact with each other. As such, it seeks to address the issue of blockchain interoperability by facilitating the exchange between multiple blockchains. Polkadot’s architecture, consisting of a “relay chain” and “parachains,” allows it to be interoperable with other systems.</p>	
	    <p>In Polkadot, the main or relay chain serves as a hub to which all of the subchains, or parachains, connect. Parachains are a type of blockchain with enhanced capabilities, including interaction with the relay chain and inter-parachain communication.</p>
      <p>Polkadot allows developers to design their parachains or link to pre-existing ones to create and trade NFTs. In addition to Aventus, other parachains on Polkadot that support NFTs include Basilisk, Astar, and Statemint. Here, the Polkadot (DOT) token is vital in protecting all parachains, which are still linked to the relay chain.</p>
      <h3>The state of NFTs and DOT’s volume</h3>
      <p>Only once in March has the overall NFT transaction volume for Polkadot in USD on Santiment surpassed $1 million, according to an analysis of the data. In fact, the value was just $341,000, at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>With no significant spikes, this volume metric showed that NFT trades on the network were reasonable. With the opening of the new NFT marketplace on Aventus, could this situation alter itself though?</p>
      <p>Likewise, DOT’s volume on Santiment has been typical, with no noticeable spikes. This volume is similar to the NFT volume. Nonetheless, the volume has picked up and has been on an uptrend after a fall seen on March 12. The volume was already over 369 million, at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Polkadot (DOT) was trading at about $6.12 on the price charts following a 24-hour hike of 3%. At the time of writing, however, some bearish momentum was creeping into its price performance.</p>
      <p>Regarding NFTs, collections, and volume, Polkadot is still behind chains like Solana and Ethereum. And yet, with the popularity of its marketplaces and distinctive NFT selections on its parachains, it might emerge as a prominent force. Its entry into the NFT market may also have a favorable effect on the DOT token.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>BCH’s correlation with BTC has led to a rally in its price</li>
        <li>If positive conviction remains, the coin’s value can be expected to appreciate even further</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Due to its statistically significant positive correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], Bitcoin Cash’s [BCH] price has also rallied in the last 24 hours. This, following the decision by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to restore all customer deposits at failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).</p>
      <p>When SVB collapsed on 11 March, BCH slipped below $110 and oscillated between $109 and $110 for most of the weekend. However, as BTC’s price rallied in the early trading hours of 13 March following the Federal Regulators’ decision to make all SVIB depositors whole, BCH reclaimed $110 and exceeded it.</p>
      <p>Still on a rally at press time, BCH’s price had appreciated by 5% in the last 24 hours. At the time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $127.31.</p>
	    <h3>Are the bulls here to stay?</h3>
	    <p>An assessment of BCH’s price movement on the daily chart revealed that the latest rally was leading up to the commencement of a new bull cycle.</p>
	    <p>At press time, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was preparing to intersect with the trend line in an upward direction. Once this happens, a new bull cycle would begin and BCH’s price will appreciate further.</p>	
	    <p>Thanks to improving sentiment and growing accumulation, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reclaimed its spot above the 50-neutral line and was pegged at 52.18. Likewise, the dynamic line of BCH’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) returned a positive reading of 0.17.</p>	
	    <p>This was another piece of evidence supporting the notion that BCH’s price will appreciate further, especially if positive sentiment lingers.</p>
      <ul><li>Set-up for success on-chain</li></ul>
      <p>According to on-chain data provider Santiment, BCH has seen sustained demand over the last 24 hours. As a result, the count of daily active addresses transacting the coin has hiked by 100%. At press time, 132,370 addresses were transacting BCH.</p>
      <p>Greater network activity is a known recipe for the sustained rally of an asset’s price. With BCH’s weighted sentiment still in positive territory, if the active addresses count continues to rally, buying momentum will grow. This will eventually lead to a another significant price uptick.</p>
      <p>Consider this – In the last 24 hours alone, BCH’s Open Interest has risen by 5%. Generally, an increase in Open Interest is considered a bullish signal, especially as it suggests that there is growing optimism and confidence in the asset’s price direction.</p>
      <p>Hence, BCH’s price might continue to appreciate. However, a decline in the king coin’s price might also precipitate a fall in BCH’s value.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Whales added 400,000 ETH despite a recent price increment</li>
        <li>More ETH is being circulated although the current vault could be overpriced</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Like a ton of assets in the crypto-market, Ethereum’s [ETH] price jumped over the weekend. Even at press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market value maintained a 5.11% hike in the last 24 hours. Needless to say, this has brought some calm to the market. Especially since much of it was flashing red over the weekend.</p>
	    <p>However, despite the gains registered on the charts, whales did not seem to be content. As pointed out by Ali_charts, a crypto-analyst on Twitter, addresses holding 1000 to 10000 ETH added $600 million to their holdings.</p>
      <p>The information, derived from Glassnode, revealed that the whales took the action when ETH was still hovering above $1,680 on the charts.</p>
      <h3>On the opposite side of ETH</h3>
	    <p>So, does the accumulation mean ETH still has a tendency to climb further? Well, according to Glassnode, the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) signal had a reading of 98.45, at press time. The metric often reflects the 90-day moving average trend of the daily transaction volume, rather than a day-to-day valuation.</p>
    	<p>Compared to its value in recent times, the aforementioned NVT signal is a high one. And, the last time it was as high was back in February 2020. Hence, it seemed to confirm that investors were pricing ETH at a premium while the market cap’s growth outpaced its on-chain transaction volume.</p>	
	    <p>While the aforementioned metric considered ETH as being currently overpriced, more of the altcoin has been in circulation over the last seven days. The circulation shows the number of unique coins that have been used for transactions within a specific period.</p>	
	    <p>At press time, the seven-day circulation was 3.96 million. This implied that many units of ETH were swirling around the market, despite their numbers falling when compared to the previous day.</p>
      <p>That being said, one metric that has consistently moved north is Active Addresses. This metric measures the number of unique addresses active on a network. With 24-hour active address count of 534,000, the reading implied that many wallets had either received or sent ETH over the last 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Almost equal exchange flow reactions</h3>
      <p>While ETH remains on whales’ radar, activities on exchanges revealed that it has been a close contest for outflows and inflows.</p>
      <p>In fact, according to Santiment, exchange outflows were as high as 28,400. This seemed to underline traders’ temporary market shortage and contribution to an asset’s appreciation.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the exchange inflows were 24,000. With the difference in favor of the outflows, it means that ETH has a slight chance of foregoing depreciation in the short term.</p>
      <p>However, traders might still need to be cautious of projection. This, because of several negative developments and contrasting market reactions.</p>

        <li>Sustained interest in various CEX tokens also recorded a hike</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite the adverse effects of the USDC situation on various aspects of the cryptocurrency sector, centralized exchanges were able to reap significant gains during this time.</p>
	    <h3>CEXs reap rewards</h3>
	    <p>According to data provided by Messari, activity on CEXs hit a 12-month high due to USDC’s de-pegging event. Exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Kraken all recorded an uptick in activity over this period.</p>
	    <p>One of the reasons for the high activity was the drop in Externally Owned Addresses on Ethereum. Externally Owned Addresses (EOAs) are user-controlled accounts on the Ethereum blockchain that are owned and controlled by individual users. Unlike contract accounts, which are controlled by code, EOAs are controlled by their private keys and can only be accessed by their respective owners.</p>	
	    <p>Most of the USDC ecosystem was integrated with the Ethereum blockchain. As the USDC stablecoin deviated from its peg, the EOAs dropped by $4 billion in value. However, centralized exchanges (CEXs) managed to accommodate this excess supply and registered a significant 49% hike in their balance as a result.</p>	
	    <p>At the time of writing, Binance was leading in terms of exchange balance, with $31.9 billion on its platform. In comparison, OKX and Bitfinex came in second and third place with $5.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.</p>
      <ul><li>Momentum on the way?</li></ul>
      <p>Following the FTX incident, numerous long-term users found it difficult to have faith in other centralized exchanges. Overcoming this mistrust was a major challenge for these exchanges. Nonetheless, the implementation of proof of reserves helped to establish some degree of trust and data transparency for customers using centralized exchanges.</p>
      <p>Binance, KuCoin, and OKX have all provided proof of reserves for their customers to see. Proof of reserves showcase the overall percentage distribution of all the assets that have been stored by these exchanges. A majority of these exchanges currently have high amounts of ETH and USDT held as reserves.</p>
      <p>The fall of USDC, coupled with the trust gained by CEXs by showing their reserves, helped generate interest in their tokens as well. In fact, over the last few days, the market caps of BNB, OKB, and KCS have all increased.</p>

      <p>On 14 March, RippleX, the open platform of the Ripple [XRP] network, confirmed that its sidechain was available on its Testnet. Built on the XRP Ledger [XRPL], the Ethereum Virtual Machine [EVM] sidechain would enable 1000 transactions per second on the ledger.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ripple updated its EVM sidechain development with access to the Testnet.</li>
        <li>XRP’s network growth declined, but developers remained significantly active.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On 14 March, RippleX, the open platform of the Ripple [XRP] network, confirmed that its sidechain was available on its Testnet. Built on the XRP Ledger [XRPL], the Ethereum Virtual Machine [EVM] sidechain would enable 1000 transactions per second on the ledger.</p>
	    <p>Contextually, the XRPL is a public blockchain led by Ripple’s developer community. The ledger is part of the ecosystem responsible for aiding asset transfer globally. So, now that the sidechain EVM Mainnet is approaching, cross-chain bridging could improve the network.</p>
      <h3>The dream is edging close to reality</h3>
	    <p>In September 2021, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz passed the proposal of the EVM side chain to the Ripple community. He backed up the proposal by noting that developers could build their own blockchain on the XRPL Mainnet using smart contracts.</p>
	    <p>Following the public introduction, blockchain technology firm Peersyst released the first phase of the EVM sidechain in October 2022. While a few compatible bridges were developed at that time, the latest update serves as the second phase of the project.</p>	
	    <p>The RippleX communique further mentioned:</p>	
	    <p><b>“Phase two of the project, on track for early 2023, will feature a permissionless EVM sidechain and bridge with a unique design that connects to the XRPL Devnet to expand participation and test scalability within a controlled environment”</b></p>
      <p>Interestingly, data available on the XRPL showed that 2,476,468 blocks had been created on the sidechain at press time. Additionally, 16,079 transactions had taken place among 179,045 addresses on the ledger.</p>
      <h3>Ripple developers are answering the call despite…</h3>
      <p>In the intervening time, the XRP development activity ditched the downside and trended higher. Moreso, the development activity measures the contribution count of developers on a project regarding upgrades. At the time of writing, the metric was 2.52, verifying that Ripple developers were actively in operation.</p>
      <p>However, the network growth did not portray similar strength. A simplification of this metric summarized the behavioral bias for adoption and the number of new addresses who have successfully transacted on the network. So, the condition down at 774 meant that XRP had been struggling despite investors who were gaining deep interest in the token.</p>
      <p>Recently, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse admitted that the blockchain-payment firm had exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). However, he cleared the air that it would never affect its operations. Thus, this EVM development could serve as concrete proof that the Ripple network was not significantly affected.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Polygon [MATIC] continued on its consecutive rise at press time.</li>
        <li>Its social dominance rose with the introduction of the Polygon domain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There have been many recent periods of uptrend activity on Polygon [MATIC], suggesting that the cryptocurrency has emerged from the doldrums it was mired in since 18 February. With the token garnering some attention in terms of social volume, its movement on exchanges is something that investors can keep monitoring.</p>
	    <h3>Polygon sees positive social volume</h3>
	    <p>As per Santiment’s chart, Polygon has experienced a boost in its social volume. The observed chart indicated that the last time MATIC experienced such an uptrend was in August. According to Alicharts, this shift was also suggestive of optimistic attitudes that could benefit the asset’s price. As of this writing, the social volume metric was over 1,000, and the weighted sentiment was over 2.2.</p>
      <p>Did the price increase in tandem with the social volume?</p>
	    <h3>MATIC on a daily timeframe</h3>
	    <p>Until 10 March, the daily timeframe chart of MATIC had trended downward for several weeks. However, the token reversed course on the aforementioned date, having increased by over 20% and trading at about $1.24 as of this writing.</p>	
	    <p>Furthermore, the trend reversal was strong enough to shift the asset’s trend from bearish to bullish. According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), MATIC crossed the neutral line. A weak bullish sentiment was also indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which revealed that it had shifted to the upside.</p>
      <p>The volume metric has also been increasing with the recent price increase. The volume was above 979 million as of the time of writing and was getting close to one billion.</p>
      <h3>Observing the trend of the flow</h3>
      <p>The Exchange NetFlow of Polygon provided additional evidence of the strength of the present bullish trend. As per CryptoQuant, since the advent of the price increase, there have been large inflows and outflows into exchanges. With over 31 million MATICs leaving exchanges as of this writing, the outflow was the overwhelming trend.</p>
      <h3>Introducing the Polygon domain</h3>
      <p>On 14 March, Polygon announced that it would partner with Unstoppable Web to introduce the Polygon domain. In addition to enabling users to create a portable identity across over 750 dApps, games, and metaverses, Polygon domains enable the creation of a digital identity. The Polygon domain could benefit the network in a manner akin to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).</p>
      <p>Given the outflow volume and Polygon’s bullish tendency, a further increase may be in store.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>MakerDAO has a new proposal to introduce a debt ceiling breaker.</li>
        <li>MKR has commenced a new bear run.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In a new emergency executive proposal, leading DeFi platform MakerDAO [MKR] has sought community approval to introduce a debt ceiling breaker for collateral assets used to mint its DAI stablecoin.</p>
      <p>This action became necessary after USD Coin [USDC] lost its parity with the U.S. dollar last weekend due to the disclosure that Circle, the issuer, held deposits at Silicon Valley Bank (SVIB). As USDC was a significant collateral backing for DAI, its de-pegging event resulted in a temporary loss of dollar parity for DAI.</p>
      <p>With this new proposal, the DeFi protocol aims to implement a mechanism to set the debt ceiling of any collateral type to zero on the Maker protocol.</p>
      <p>MakerDAO’s debt ceiling refers to the maximum number of DAI tokens that can be generated against the value of the collateral assets locked in the Maker protocol. The debt ceiling is set individually for each type of collateral the protocol accepts. The purpose of the debt ceiling is to maintain the stability of the MakerDAO system by limiting the number of DAI that can be issued,</p>
      <p>By introducing a debt ceiling breaker, MakerDAO aims to handle scenarios where the underlying collateral asset is experiencing substantial volatility. This mechanism would enable MakerDAO to safeguard its liquidity and prevent losses in such situations.</p>
    	<h3>MKR demand falters, prices suffer</h3>
	    <p>Because of its statistically significant positive correlation with Bitcoin [BTC], the growth in the king coin’s price following Federal Regulators’ decision to make all SVIB depositors whole resulted in a temporary price rally for MKR.</p>
	    <p>However, the lack of new liquidity caused MKR’s price to decline, and stagnated the uptick. According to data from Santiment, the alt has experienced a decrease in network activity since the beginning of the week. For example, the count of daily active addresses trading MKR has since fallen by 86%. Likewise, new demand that might aid price growth has also dropped by 95% in the last four days.</p>	
	    <p>The token accumulation was evident on the daily chart at press time. However, it was not enough to initiate any significant price growth. As of this writing, MKR’s RSI rested above its centerline at 54.17, while its MFI, on an uptrend, was pegged at 41.</p>	
	    <p>A closer look at the asset’s MACD indicator revealed why there had been a price decline since the week started. The MACD line intersected with the trend line on 11 March, ushering in a new bear run, hence the downtrend.</p>

      <p>The recent turmoil in the U.S. banking industry has left crypto-companies searching high and low for new partner banks. Last week, Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank all shut down following regulatory intervention. This forced many users to move their assets elsewhere.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to find alternatives to these banks as their instant payment platforms were critical for transactions 24*7. According to many, the current regulatory environment in the U.S indicates it is not best suited for the growth of the crypto-space.</p>
	    <h3>Experts share their two cents</h3>
	    <p>Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood took to Twitter on 15 March to slam U.S. regulators for the banking crisis. According to the exec,</p>
	    <p><b>“Instead of blocking decentralized, transparent, auditable and well-functioning financial platforms with no central points of failure, regulators should have been focused on the centralized and opaque points of failure looming in the traditional banking system.”</b></p>	
	    <p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently suggested that the crypto-industry has “already started moving outside” of the U.S. He claimed regulations put U.S. at “severe risk” of missing out on being an attractive hub for the evolution of crypto-innovation.</p>	
	    <h3>Crypto-firms hunt for substitute banks</h3>
      <p>Following the chaos, Circle hired Cross River Bank as its new partner and expanded ties with others.</p>
      <p>Additionally, according to reports, Digital Currency Group (DCG) is trying to find new banking partners for portfolio companies.</p>
      <p><b>“Santander (SAN), HSBC (HSBA), Deutsche Bank (DB), BankProv, Bridge Bank, Mercury, Multis and Series Financial are still willing to connect with crypto firms.”</b></p>
      <p>DCG has also reached out to international banks Revolut in UK, United Overseas Bank in Singapore, and Bank Leumi in Israel.</p>
      <p>At this point, many other crypto-firms are possibly looking to move overseas as well. As regulations in countries like Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore are crypto-friendly, they might see an influx of companies. These countries do not impose capital gains taxes on crypto as well, making it equally desirable for private investors.</p>
      <h3>Could there be a domino effect?</h3>
      <p>The latest in the series is crypto-bank Anchorage Digital announcing the layoffs of about 20% of its workforce, citing regulatory uncertainty in the United States.</p>
      <p>Anchorage further added that regulatory dynamics are creating headwinds for its business and the crypto-industry. It is likely that more banks will have to take harsh measures to prop up their businesses.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>U.S. government is arguing that $1 billion transaction made by Binance.US to purchase assets of Voyager should be placed on hold</li>
        <li>In order to file an appeal, a two-week delay on the court’s approval has been requested</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The plan by insolvent lender Voyager Digital to sell its digital assets to cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US includes a clause that would preclude U.S. authorities from bringing legal action against anyone connected to the sale.</p>
	    <p>According to a motion filed by U.S. Trustee William Harrington and other government lawyers before a New York bankruptcy court, “the court improperly exceeded its statutory power” in authorizing the pardoning. In fact, they have asked for a two-week hold on the court’s approval of the transaction so that they could submit an appeal.</p>
      <h3>What does the Provision say?</h3>
	    <p>The clause, which the court authorized on March 7 after finding that 97% of Voyager customers supported the idea, was designed to shield those involved in the sale from being held personally accountable for its implementation.</p>
	    <p>Despite not objecting to other aspects of the proposed transaction, U.S. authorities claim the provision would make it more difficult for the government to “exercise its police and regulatory responsibilities.”</p>	
	    <p>The decision was made in response to an appeal from the U.S. Trustee, a division of the Department of Justice in charge of bankruptcy cases. The division is concerned that the agreement would essentially exonerate Voyager and its employees from violations of securities or tax laws.</p>	
	    <p>“The Court cannot tell the Government to speak now or forever hold its peace before Voyager and Binance.US are wed,” according to Damian Williams’ filing as U.S Attorney. Nothing in Bankruptcy Law allows courts to absolve parties from responsibility to the Government for actions taken in the past and in the future, it added.</p>
      <p>Williams argued that until appeals are resolved in higher courts, approval of the arrangement — or at least those portions that restrict the government’s capacity to execute the law — should be suspended.</p>
      <p>The sale was allowed last week by New York bankruptcy judge Michael Wiles. He had previously shown significant skepticism towards the Securities and Exchange Commission’s claims that Voyager’s VGX token would be unregistered securities.</p>
      <h3>What to expect?</h3>
      <p>On March 6, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) objected to the plan as well, citing the “extraordinary” and “highly improper” exculpation provision. The SEC claimed that Binance.US is running an unregistered securities exchange and that the repayment token would be an unregistered security offering.</p>
      <p>According to the most recent projections, the strategy is anticipated to result in the creditors of Voyager receiving about 73% of the value of their money back.</p>

      <p>To provide an execution environment for running the Ethereum [ETH] Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts on its network, leading decentralized storage network Filecoin [FIL] finally launched its Filecoin Virtual Machine [FVM] on the mainnet on 14 March.</p>
      <p>The launch of the FVM formed the final step of Filecoin’s Masterplan to bring large-scale computation and the ability to power web-scale apps to the decentralized storage network.</p>
      <p>According to the press release, the Filecoin Virtual Machine will provide similar abilities to Ethereum, allowing for the development and deployment of decentralized applications and the ability to connect with other blockchains.</p>
      <p>Following the launch of the FVM, leading cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced the integration of its web3 wallet with the upgrade.</p>
      <h3>Day traders rally toward FIL</h3>
	    <p>In the last 24 hours, FIL’s price rallied by 7%. With a surge in FIL trading following the launch of the FVM, trading volume has climbed by 30% during the same period, per data from CoinMarketCap. As of this writing, the altcoin exchanged hands for $6.81 per FIL token.</p>
	    <p>Taking advantage of the FVM launch, data obtained from Coinglass indicates that there has been an increase in the number of FIL trading positions opened within the past 24 hours. At $177.5 million at press time, FIL’s Open Interest has climbed by 2%.</p>	
	    <p>A jump in an asset’s Open Interest indicated that more traders were interested in taking positions in the asset. This often reflected a growing bullish sentiment toward that asset’s price.</p>	
	    <p>Moreso, there were a higher number of short liquidations than long liquidations in the last 24 hours. As the positive sentiment toward FIL continued to rise, data from Coinglass revealed.</p>
      <p>Further, on a 12-hour chart, FIL accumulation rallied significantly. FIL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) approached the overbought region at press time. The RSI was 60.99, while the MFI was 66.58. With weighted sentiment still in the positive territory per data from Santiment, this accumulation momentum is expected to be sustained. Therefore, more price growth should be on the horizon for FIL.</p>
      <p>Also, FIL’s On-balance volume (OBV) maintained an uptrend at press time, suggesting rallying token accumulation. When an asset’s OBV is trending upwards, it means that the volume of trades is heavier on the buy side, indicating that investors are more interested in buying the asset than selling it.</p>

      <p>Over the weekend, stablecoins became “unstable” as fifth-ranked cryptocurrency as Circle USDC in market value lost its dollar peg. Following the event, a lot of investors switched sides and held their stables in Tether [USDT]. This led to a drop in USDC’s market capitalization and increased dominance for Tether.</p>
	    <p>While many may have believed that USDT could act as a safe haven, not many trusted keeping them on exchanges. In fact, whales were the leading light in this group.</p>
      <h3>Whales keep stability to themselves</h3>
	    <p>According to Santiment, about $1 billion USDT left exchanges and were moved into self-custody multiple times in the last ten days. This was an uncommon occurrence because the act had only happened eight times over the last 365 days before now.</p>
	    <p>During the time Circle revealed its exposure, Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino, had assured the community that it had no links with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Regardless, USDC has found its way back to $1, although the price at press time was slightly below the expected value.</p>	
	    <p>Meanwhile, USDT’s non-zero addresses decreased around 18 February. But, according to Glassnode, the number of unique addresses holding a positive amount of the stablecoin had increased to 4.15 million. This confirmed the restoration of the USDT’s superiority as USDC’s position in this aspect only had 1.59 million unique addresses.</p>	
	    <p>Moreso, one part of the USDT network that caught the eye was the velocity. An explanation of this metric is that it measures how many units of a coin are circulating in a network. It is derived by calculating dividing the on-chain transaction volume by the market capitalization.</p>
      <h3>High circulation but conviction is down</h3>
      <p>At press time, USDT surpassed the highs of the last ten months, as it peaked at 0.366. This value means that there has been a rapid increase in liquid supply. Therefore, the broader market was increasingly transacting using USDT. But for those who held a large supply, keeping off exchanges was the way to go.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the USDC troubles helped improve the perception towards USDT. This was because Santiment’s data showed that the latter’s stablecoin reached 6.628 on 12 March. The weighted sentiment compiles the public opinion about an asset.</p>
      <p>Hence, the hike implied that social volume was high and the feeling towards USDT was largely positive. However, press time data from the on-chain analytic platform revealed that the metric had been suppressed a bit.</p>
      <p>The supply percentage held by top addresses also trended along the downside. At press time, the chunk of these heavy-purse investors had decreased to 29.53.</p>

      <p>Measured from the swing low at $0.0625, Dogecoin [DOGE] has made gains of close to 25% within the past five days. The sentiment across the crypto sphere was bullish following Bitcoin’s [BTC] sharp breakout past the $22k region on Monday.</p>
	    <p>Bitcoin’s surge past $25.2k resistance on Tuesday meant it, too, had a strong bullish bias going forward. Dogecoin bulls might have to be wary- such a strong pump could see a large retracement before the next leg.</p>
      <h3>Two lower highs were breached and showed a shift in bias</h3>
	    <p>The bearish breaker on the daily timeframe was breached in the opposite direction as Dogecoin reversed in dramatic fashion. The trading volume was high on the way up for DOGE, and the indicators also flashed bullish signals.</p>
	    <p>The Awesome Oscillator was above the zero line and climbing, and showed intense bullish momentum. The Directional Movement Index also showed an uptrend in progress. Over the past few days, the -DI (red) was forced to retreat beneath the 20 mark and the +DI replaced it. With the ADX (yellow) also above 20, they showed a significant uptrend on the 4-hour chart.</p>	
	    <p>The market structure also corroborated with this finding. The price has breached two of the recent lower highs and flipped the previous bearish structure to bullish. The $0.073 level of support was retested almost perfectly before DOGE climbed higher yet again.</p>	
	    <p>The next area of resistance was at $0.08. This was an area that had served as support since mid-January. Hence, it was likely to be full of sellers. If this area was retested as support in the coming days, it could offer a buying opportunity.</p>
      <h3>The futures market showed capital flowing in alongside Dogecoin gains</h3>
      <p>The 15-minute chart showed periods of consolidation and expansion for Dogecoin on the lower timeframes over the past few days. Each pullback on the price chart saw the Open Interest decline.</p>
      <p>Similarly, each move upward for DOGE was accompanied by a surge in OI. Taken together, it showed bullish sentiment was strong in the market.</p>

      <p>Multiple dApps and DEXs on the Solana network have seen an uptick in activity over the last few days. However, this spike in activity on Solana may not be enough for the chain to take part in this bull run.</p>
	    <p>The DEX in question would be Drift Protocol, with the same recording an ATH recently in terms of daily active users.</p>
      <p>Another dApp – Light Protocol –  witnessed an improvement in terms of activity on the Solana network.  The protocol verifies ZK SNARKs on the network. At press time, the protocol had managed to complete over 2 million transactions.</p>
      <p>Despite the success of Solana’s protocols, however, the overall TVL of the network declined. It fell from $281 million to $243.06 million over the past few weeks alone.</p>
      <p>The decline in Solana’s TVL was accompanied by a decline in interest for its NFTs. According to data from SolanaFloor, for instance, the protocol’s blue-chip NFTs struggled to grow over the last month. This contributed to a hike in the overall volume of NFTs sold on the protocol from $119,662 to $49,385.</p>

	    <p>The decline in NFT interest would be due to increasing negative sentiment that has been growing around Solana. With multiple downtimes and failures, many in the crypto-community have turned skeptical about the future of the Solana network.</p>
	    <p>In fact, SOL has also suffered during this time period. According to Santiment’s data, the trading volume for SOL fell from 3.41 billion to 1.36 billion. The price volatility, however, continued to hike. Higher volatility would make many risk-averse traders shy away from buying SOL.</p>	
	    <p>However, development activity on the Solana network surged over the last few weeks. This spike in development activity suggested that the frequency with which developers on the Solana network have been contributing to its GitHub is high.</p>	
	    <p>This could imply that new updates and upgrades may be on their way for Solana in the future.</p>
      <p>However, the promise of new upgrades hasn’t been enough for traders to become optimistic about the future of Solana.</p>
      <p>In fact, according to Coinglass’ data, 52.08% of all trades against Solana have been short positions.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin mixer – ChipMixer has been shut down by authorities, as per an announcement by Europol. The operation involved the collaboration of regulatory authorities from various countries. The operation also resulted in the seizure of four servers, over 1909.4 Bitcoins (BTC) – over $46.6 million (nearly EUR 44.2 million), and 7 TB of data.</p>
	    <h3>Multiple agencies collaborate to bring down the Bitcoin mixer</h3>
	    <p>United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigation, and Department of Justice took part in taking down the platform. Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office and General Prosecutors Office Frankfurt-Main also headed the operations. Others included Belgium’s Federal police, Poland’s Central Cybercrime Bureau, and Switzerland’s Cantonal Police of Zurich. The press release further said,</p>
	    <p><b>“The ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.”</b></p>	
	    <p>Moreover, Europol claims that the Bitcoin mixer, launched in mid-2017, was used to launder over $2.87 billion in cryptocurrencies. A majority of this activity was related to markets in the darkweb, stolen cryptocurrencies, and illegal goods trafficking.</p>
      <p>Notably, ransomware groups like Mamba, Dharma, Zeppelin, and others have the Bitcoin mixer to launder illegally obtained funds. In addition, the regulatory authorities are investigating the platform’s possible association with the funds related to the now-bankrupt crypto exchange – FTX. The authorities are investigating whether the mixer was used by hackers to launder FTX’s funds, which totally amounted to $372 million. As per an on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, ChipMixer was used to launder 360 BTC of FTX’s funds.</p>
      <p>The Bitcoin mixer was also used by hackers to launder money stolen by Ronin Bridge, according to a report by Slowmist. Hackers had sent 26,021.89 BTC to Chipmixer. The same platform was used by Binance hackers in August 2019, with over 5,300 BTC sent for mixing.</p>	
	    <p>The current action has resulted in the shut down of the website. However, the authority has not announced any arrests related to the case. The press release further read,</p>
      <p><b>“Europol facilitated the information exchange between national authorities and supported the coordination of the operation. Europol also provided analytical support linking available data to various criminal cases within and outside the EU, and supported the investigation through operational analysis, crypto tracing, and forensic analysis.”</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>ADA’s four-hour chart was bullish.</li>
        <li>The bulls had minimal leverage as per long vs. short positions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cardano [ADA] rebounded strongly after hitting its recent low of $0.3020 on 12 March. It saw aggressive buying at the above lows pushing its price break key resistances as Bitcoin [BTC] surged to the $26k area. </p>
	    <p>However, BTC saw a sharp rejection at $26k and was operating below $25k at press time. Similarly, ADA hit the price ceiling at $0.368 and entered a retracement, pushing it into a key price range. As such, BTC’s price action will determine ADA’s price direction in the next few days/weeks.</p>
      <h3>ADA re-enters a previous short-term consolidation range</h3>
	    <p>ADA had initially breached the $0.3306 – $0.3466 consolidation range during BTC’s extra rally after the February US CPI data release. The price rejection at $0.3679 set ADA back into the range. But the price action was in the upper range, suggesting a likely bullish breakout if BTC maintains the $24k level and surges.</p>
	    <p>Therefore, ADA could swing between $0.3306 and $0.3466 before a possible breakout. A break of the range and a close above $0.3466 could tip near-term bulls to push the price toward the overhead resistance at $0.3679. But they must clear the hurdles at $0.3513 and $0.3605.</p>	
	    <p>Alternatively, ADA could witness intense selling pressure if the price closed below $0.3306. But the drop could slow down at the double bottom pattern’s neckline of $0.3200 or the previous low of $0.3020. These levels could be used as short-selling targets, especially if BTC witnessed a sharp retracement towards $20k. </p>	
	    <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) pulled back from an overbought territory and moved sideways, indicating buying pressure drop, but selling and buying pressure was almost equivalent at press time. Similarly, the Average Directional Index (ADX) sloped downwards, showing likely further retracement or consolidation for ADA. Given the RSI’s sideways movement, consolidation was highly likely. </p>
      <h3>Bulls have limited leverage in the short-term</h3>
      <p>Bulls had slight hope based on the ADA’s long/short ratio that showed slight leverage on the four-hour timeframe. It shows investors’ positive expectations in the short term. But bears and potential retracement could also not be overruled.</p>
      <p>In addition, ADA’s funding rate was positive across major exchanges, indicating the underlying bullish sentiment. But investors should track BTC’s price action to make more profitable moves.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ETH sees surge in demand which may remain in the long term courtesy of deflationary milestone</li>
        <li>ETH shorts traders suffer as price pivots while demand for leverage recovers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ethereum’s EIP 1559 in August last year marked an important milestone for the network and ETH. The impact of that milestone is particularly evident in the fact that ETH is now deflationary.</p>
	    <p>The latest Ethereum data reveals that the network has so far burned over 3 million ETH. The total amount of ETH burned is worth over $9.09 billion, trimming the post Merge total supply by slightly over 62,000 ETH. These findings underscore the progress that the Ethereum network has achieved so far as part of its PoS transition.</p>
      <h3>ETH’s race for sound money</h3>
	    <p>ETH’s current 0.42% deflationary rate puts it well within the list of sound money. Why is this important? Well, traditional fiat money is currently feeling the weight of inflation which has been gradually causing the loss of value. As such, investors are eying asset classes that may allow them to protect their wealth from inflation.</p>
	    <p>A deflationary asset such as ETH is currently more preferable both in the short and long-term. This is likely one of the reasons why the demand or ETH recently surged, resulting in significant recovery from the bearish performance we saw earlier this month.</p>	
	    <p>In fact, Glassnode’s data confirmed a surge in demand for the cryptocurrency. For instance – ETH’s exchange outflows volume just hit a new 3-month high. This is a sign that ETH traders have been aggressively buying the recent dip.</p>	
	    <p>The latest ETH exchange flow data confirmed that exchange outflows are back on the rise. A consequence of the robust buying pressure observed over the last few days, a period during which its price action bounced back strongly.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned surge was strong enough to push ETH back to a new YTD high. As a consequence, the retest of its previous resistance level yielded some sell pressure. Hence, the higher exchange inflows than outflows.</p>
      <h3>The state of ETH shorts, liquidations, and leverage</h3>
      <p>Shorts traders once anticipated further downside after the events of last month. However, the pivot on 9 March triggered a surge in liquidations and a shift to long positions.</p>
      <p>Demand for leverage has been declining since the end of February, likely due to concerns over market outcome in March. This has been an unsurprising outcome, one factoring the recent market events which made it more difficult to predict the next outcome.</p>
      <p>However, we have seen an uptick in demand for leverage over the last few days, with the same corresponding with the price surge.</p>
      <p>The market will likely feature more volatility if the level of leverage continues to rise. A higher likelihood of liquidations may lead to more wild swings.</p>

	    <h3><strong>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</strong></h3>
	    <p>The US dollar has initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday, to reach the ¥135 level. This is an area that has previously been resistance, and therefore the fact that we broke above that level would have been a very strong sign, but we have given back those gains to show signs of weakness since then. At this point, it looks like we are reaching down to the ¥132.50 level, an area that I think should end up being support. If we can break below there, then it’s likely that this market starts to fall toward the ¥130 level.</p>	
	    <p>This all began with concerns with Credit Suisse, as Saudi financiers decided that they were no longer going to try to prop up the bank. Now we have to worry about contagion in the banking system, and as a result a lot of money flew into bond markets. Remember, the Bank of Japan is trying to fight higher interest rates right now, so therefore they have to step into the bond market and purchase those bonds with freshly printed in Japanese yen to keep the rates under 50 basis points on the 10 year. On the other hand, if rates start to drop around the world, then it’s likely that there is less pressure on the Bank of Japan, meaning that they will be buying less yen, and then meaning that the Japanese yen will strengthen, which is exactly what we see on this chart.</p>	
	    <p>The more fear that we have out there, the more likely it is to be a situation where the Japanese yen gets a bit of a boost, and therefore as long as his fear is out there, we may see the Japanese yen be one of the better performing currencies. As soon as the market continues to see a lot of relief, then this market will turn right back around. That being said, these are very dangerous days so don’t be surprised at all that the market would be very volatile and noisy, so in this environment you need to keep your position size relatively small until you get confirmation of your position.</p>

	    <p>The ¥160 level has offered a little bit of support, but if we blow through there, it’s possible that the market could go down to the ¥157.50 level. In that area we would more likely than not see a significant amount of support. If we bounce from here, I don’t necessarily think that we are going to see a new bull market, just that we may have a bit of a consolidation area in the short term. Either way, volatility continues to be a major issue, and you will have to keep an eye on your positions. Now is not the time to be complacent with positioning, and therefore it’s crucial that you keep your position size reasonable.</p>	
	    <p>At this point, the market will continue to be noisy more than anything else, and with that in mind you will have to understand that you need to look at the big picture. We are most certainly in an area that could be important, but it’s also worth noting that the British pound has underperformed against the yen when compared to multiple other currency pairs, so I would assume this might be a market that is softer than many others.</p>

	    <p>The authorities took down the platform's infrastructure, seizing four servers, 7 terabytes of data and 1909.4 bitcoins (BTC) ($47.7 million), Europol said on Wednesday.</p>
	    <p>The seizure was also supported by Belgium, Poland and Switzerland.</p>

	    <p>One operator of ChipMixer, Minh Quốc Nguyễn, from Hanoi, Vietnam, was charged on Wednesday in Philadelphia with money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and identity theft, the DOJ said.</p>
      <p>The platform is believed to have enabled the laundering of 152,000 BTC – around $3.8 billion at current prices – since 2017, a large share of which was connected to ransomware groups, illicit goods trafficking and child sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p>According to the DOJ, activities enabled by ChipMixer include over $700 million in bitcoin associated with wallets designated as stolen funds, including those related to heists by North Korean cyber actors, and bitcoin used by the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to purchase infrastructure for Linux-based malware Drovorub.</p>
      <p>Mixing services gained increased prominence in August 2022 when Ethereum-based mixer Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for facilitating North Korea’s money-laundering operations.

      <h3><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></h3>
	    <p>After Credit Suisse got the news that there was not going to be more of a bailout from Saudi financiers, suddenly there seems to be a concern of contagion in the European Union. After all, the bank has been the epicenter of a lot of problems for the last several years, and without assistance it plunged, sending the CDS market for that bank pricing in a 36% possibility of default. Because of this, it’s very likely that money is flowing away from the European Union as Credit Suisse almost certainly has its fingers all throughout the continent.</p>
	    <p>The euro plunged towards the 200-Day EMA, and by the time New Yorkers got to work was down 200 pips. If the market were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, it could open up a new rush of selling pressure, sending the Euro down to the 1.03 level, possibly even down to the parity level. In that environment it is likely that we would see quite a bit of US dollar strength in general, as traders will be looking for safety. It almost certainly means that the market will continue to favor the US dollar as money goes flying towards the US Treasury market.</p>	
	    <p>If we do rally at this point, it’s difficult to imagine that it sticks anytime soon, with the 50-Day EMA more likely than not offering a little bit of resistance on the way up. Furthermore, the market struggled with the 1.07 area, an area that previously had been difficult to get above. If we break above the 1.08 level, then it opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.10 level, although at this point it seems very unlikely to be the case.</p>	
	    <p>We recently had seen the Euro rally a bit due to the fact that a lot of traders are counting on the Federal Reserve cutting rates, due to the fact that there was a bailout of the bank in California just a few days ago. However, if the Europeans suddenly find themselves needing to worry about contagion, that essentially makes things “all even”, which of course would be bad all the way around in that environment.</p>

      <h3><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></h3>
	    <p>The Australian dollar initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday but struggled at the 0.67 level yet again. This is an area where we had previously seen support, and now it looks as if market memory has come back into the picture to send the Aussie lower. This makes a certain amount of sense considering there’s a lot of “risk off” attitude out there due to the fact that major banks are starting to struggle, meaning Credit Suisse. If that’s going to be the case, there will be a run to safety currency such as the US dollar as there will be a run toward the bond market.</p>
	    <p>Underneath, the 0.6550 level is an area that has previously been important, so therefore if we were to break through there, it would likely need to send this market down to the 0.64 level. The Australian dollar of course is highly sensitive to risk appetite so I think this continues to be a very noisy situation, as traders hope the Federal Reserve is going to step out and cut interest rates, with the Fed Fund Futures markets suggesting there could be 100 basis points of interest rate cuts by the end of the year.</p>	
	    <p>Any rally at this point in time will have to deal with not only the 0.67 level, but also the 0.68 level. The 0.68 level is a significant barrier, and if we were to break above there it would obviously be a very bullish sign. The 200-Day EMA sits near the 0.6850 level and is dropping at this point. That of course could be a large technical barrier that will be difficult to get above any time soon. It’s also worth noting that we had bounced high enough to hit the 50% Fibonacci level from the massive selloff previously, and now it looks like we are ready to go much lower, perhaps reaching down to the 0.62 level where we had bounced from to begin with. It will be very noisy, but it certainly looks as if the Australian dollar is struggling to find its footing for a bigger move anytime soon.</p>

	    <p>Dear Reader,</p>
	    <p>Predictions that things will get worse before they get better are commonplace among the punditocracy in their comments on virtually any subject one cares to name. But they’ve arguably become even more common in crypto than in other fields following the industry’s travails during the past year. So far, so unsurprising.</p>	
	    <p>The failure of cryptocurrency-focused lender Silvergate, which had been widely expected since at least the beginning of this month, alongside the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, are very much of a piece with this narrative.</p>	
	    <p>The closure of the Silvergate Exchange Network and Signature Bank’s Signet, real-time payment platforms that allowed clients to move money into crypto around the clock, is already affecting crypto trade. The two services handled a huge chunk of fiat settlement for crypto, and their disappearance from the market is crimping liquidity, threatening to send transaction costs higher, at least in the short term.</p>
      <p>Where the darkest-before-the-dawn narrative starts to get interesting, though, involves what comes next. As we’ve seen, the crypto industry has an uncanny knack of finding creative ways out of tight spots, and in any case, it’s a sector that’s experiencing growing pains like any other as it moves through its teenage years and into adulthood.</p>
      <p>The banking system didn’t collapse during the global financial crisis 15 years ago when the titans of TradFi were shaken to their foundations, and neither will crypto as it loses some important players but finds others to take their place.</p>
      <p>The strife stirred up by Silvergate, SVB and Signature will pass, and, since nature abhors a vacuum, new providers of similar services will doubtless swoop in and fill the gap they leave in likely even more innovative ways.</p>
      <p>If there’s one thing that being in this industry should have taught all of us by now, it’s that nothing stays the same for long and that this frenetic pace of change is what keeps the sector at the cutting edge as it continues to shape the future of finance.</p>
      <p>We of course regret the trifecta of failures that have occurred in recent days. But long live disruption.</p>
      <p>Until the next time,</p>

      <p>By the numbers: USDC — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.</p>
      <p>Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, regained parity with the U.S. dollar on Monday morning Asia time after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said it had taken over failed tech- and crypto-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and guaranteed its deposits to prevent a broader bank run.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USDC fell as low as US$0.8774 on Saturday before recovering to US$0.999 around mid-morning Hong Kong time on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap data. It has mostly hovered around the US$0.997 mark since.</li>
        <li>USDC regained its peg after the FDIC said it had taken control of SVB on Sunday. Circle had held US$3.3 billion of deposits, accounting for around 8% of total USDC reserves, at the troubled bank.</li>
        <li>Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire said that USDC’s deposits held by SVB would be fully recoverable. Circle also announced a partnership with New Jersey-based Cross River Bank to enable the automated minting and redemption of USDC for customers starting on Monday.</li>
        <li>USDC started trading off its peg over the weekend after it was revealed that it held reserves at SVB, which had more than US$200 billion in assets and represents the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis of 2008.</li>
        <li>SVB and Signature Bank, two key lenders to the crypto industry, were both shut down and taken over by U.S. regulators to prevent systemic risk to the broader banking industry.</li>
        <li>“All depositors of [Signature Bank] will be made whole,” said a joint statement released by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. “​​As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.”</li>
        <li>USDC is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a US$38.4 billion market cap.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></h3>
      <p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was not due to its affiliations with crypto. But combined with the failure of Signature and Silvergate, its collapse has rattled the industry to its core.</p>
      <p>When Signature went down, it was revealed that Coinbase and Paxos, the issuer of Binance’s BUSD stablecoin, collectively had around US$500 million deposited in the bank. When Silicon Valley Bank called it a day, USDC issuer Circle had several billion dollars parked there.</p>
      <p>Although Circle acted quickly to reassure investors they wouldn’t lose their money, a bigger question arose: Is the crypto industry’s long-term viability reliant on regulators stepping in to clean up its messes?</p>
      <p>Since 2008, and before that, if we’re honest, central banks around the world have played a very visible role in backstopping the financial system and the economy more broadly when things have gone sideways. As the Covid pandemic brought much of the world to a halt, their huge injections of liquidity spared it an even worse fate than it ended up suffering. That may have been a rescue that was always guaranteed. Crypto has no such luxury.</p>
      <p>Circle may have handled its Silicon Valley problem adroitly, but would Tether fare so well in similar circumstances? Tether appears to be only skimpily regulated in the U.S., yet its market cap is nearly twice that of USDC. If it gets into trouble, there are few people it can turn to for help.</p>
      <p>When Terra collapsed last year, no central authority was willing to pick up the bill. If crypto wants to be taken seriously, its “safest” assets must be made safer than they currently are.</p>
      <h3><strong>2.Gate carsh</strong></h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-162-3.jpg" alt="NCX Gate crash"/>
      <p>By the numbers: Silvergate — over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.</p>
      <p>California-based, crypto-focused lender Silvergate Bank is being wound up by its parent company, Silvergate Capital, becoming another victim of last year’s collapse of crypto exchange FTX.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Silvergate Capital will shut down the bank’s operations and liquidate it in an orderly manner, offering full repayments to all depositors, according to a company announcement.</li>
        <li>Unlike the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, Silvergate’s shutdown has not involved intervention by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</li>
        <li>As a federally insured bank, Silvergate provided banking services to the crypto industry. In 2017, it rolled out its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a 24/7 payment network allowing instantaneous fiat transactions between crypto exchanges and their customers.</li>
        <li>The bank was hit hard by the collapse of FTX in November 2022, with its non-interest-bearing deposits slumping from US$12.1 billion on Sept. 30 to US$3.9 billion on Dec. 31, a dive of more than 67%, according to a Silvergate quarterly report.</li>
        <li>Silvergate reported a US$1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 and had laid off 40% of its staff by Jan. 5 this year. It is also being probed by U.S. prosecutors over its links to Alameda Research, FTX’s trading arm.</li>
        <li>On March 1, Silvergate Capital announced in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it was evaluating “its ability to continue as a going concern.” and it discontinued its SEN service on March 3.</li>
        <li>The crypto market has felt the absence of SEN, which Silvergate said had handled around US$563.3 billion of U.S. dollar transfers last year. On some U.S. crypto exchanges, Bitcoin-to-dollar and Bitcoin-to-Tether transactions dropped between 35% and 45% between the beginning of the month and March 11, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.</li>
        <li>At the same time, U.S.-based crypto exchanges are seeking alternatives for banking services, with Kraken set to launch its own bank in the state of Wyoming, aiming to offer “a more seamless integration between crypto and the traditional financial system”.</li>
        <li>Silvergate’s stock was trading at US$2.21 at press time, down more than 80% from its opening price on March 1, according to data from Yahoo Finance.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></h3>
      <p>Crypto users could be forgiven for feeling un-banked in the U.S., especially when it comes to 24/7 payments. The loss of Silvergate’s seamless off-ramp has meant crypto companies have been forced to find alternative means of transacting with traditional finance.</p>
      <p>A stark illustration of this came in the form of Circle’s weekend announcement that it would cover any losses related to the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, but that investors would have to wait until banks opened on Monday before they could withdraw their funds.</p>
      <p>This is a profound development affecting one of crypto’s key features: markets that never close and the ability to cash out anytime. It’s a problem being felt by other companies, too.</p>
      <p>Crypto.com and Binance are having to find new off-ramps for the euro and British pound after banking partners pulled out of crypto. While businesses are exploring other options, and new companies gear up to meet their needs, cryptocurrencies look more isolated from the rest of the finance sector.</p>
      <p>This is likely to continue as regulators scrutinize the balance sheets of businesses offering services to the industry. It ought to be beneficial for consumers in the long run, but for now, it leaves crypto with fewer friends in TradFi.</p>
      <h3><strong>3.Regulatory consolidation</strong></h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-162-4.jpg" alt="NCX Regulatory consolidation"/>
      <p>China has passed a plan to establish a new national financial regulator, replacing the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, according to state-run news outlet CGTN. The move was part of an overhaul of State Council institutions announced at the annual “two sessions” meetings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference last Friday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The new regulatory administration will be set up directly under the State Council. Aside from replacing the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), it will also consolidate certain functions of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The new regulator’s official name has not yet been revealed.</li>
        <li>Financial regulation in China has up to now been the preserve of the CBIRC, the PBOC and the CSRC, whose functions have at times overlapped. Following the reform, the respective responsibilities of PBOC and CSRC to protect consumers and investors will be shifted to the regulator, which will supervise most of the country’s financial activities, apart from the securities sector.</li>
        <li>The reform will further centralize China’s supervision of its finance sector and comes as part of an overall consolidation of political power in the country.</li>
        <li>“China’s regulatory reforms will strengthen regulators’ capability to establish and enforce a unified regulatory framework, as well as reduce the room for regulatory arbitrage,” CNBC reported Moody’s Investors Service Vice President David Yin as having said in a note.</li>
        <li>The reform plan follows President Xi Jinping’s warning in February about three “systemic risks” in China’s economy: risks to the real estate sector, financial risks and local government debt risks.</li></ul>
        <li>The plan does not give much indication of how crypto assets will be regulated. According to a PBOC notice dated September 2021 that announced China’s blanket ban on cryptocurrency transactions, the CBIRC, the PBOC and the CSRC were together responsible for curbing crypto speculation to safeguard financial stability.</li>
      <h3><strong>Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?</strong></h3>
      <p>Beijing’s announcement of a new financial regulator shows the extent to which it is poised to charge ahead with its Digital China strategy while ramping up efforts to identify and weed out perceived risks to the country’s financial system.</p>
      <p>When China banned cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, 10 regulators — including the  China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the People’s Bank of China and the China Securities Regulatory Commission — pointed to crypto as a risk and announced a ban in a joint notice. There have been some overlaps in oversight responsibilities among the three authorities, but now, with the establishment of the new regulator, currently informally known as “the National Financial Regulatory Administration,” the reshuffle is expected to clarify regulatory power and functions.</p>
      <p>According to analysts at Citic Securities and Guotai Junan Securities, cited in a report by business media outlet Caixin Global, the top-level realignment aims to spell out the regulatory relationship between monetary policy and financial consumer protection.</p>
      <p>When it comes to consumer protection, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Tuesday released a report showing a growing number of complaints associated with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Last year, NFT buyers in China flooded SAMR with gripes about scams and price manipulation, with official complaints skyrocketing 30,000% to 59,700 from just 198 the previous year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China appears determined to develop and oversee the industries contributing to its digital economy by setting up a national data bureau. That makes sense, as a big chunk of the nation’s economy depends on its digital industries. A government “work report” submitted on March 5 to the country’s rubber-stamp legislature showed that the value-added output of new industries and businesses in the country’s digital economy accounted for more than 17% of gross domestic product.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how the new financial regulator will approach NFTs, which in China have frequently involved fraud and wild speculation, and how it and other authorities will strike a balance between encouraging digital innovation and ramped-up regulatory scrutiny. But what’s more certain following the heavily politically loaded meetings that wrapped up a few days ago is that however China’s digital future takes shape, it may well look even more centralized under the Communist Party’s control than it already is.</p>

      <p><strong>In this article:</strong></p>
      <p>KuCoin Ventures, the venture arm of China-focused (but Seychelles-registered) crypto exchange KuCoin, led a $10 million funding round into the stablecoin issuer behind CNHC, a stablecoin pegged to the value of the offshore yuan.</p>
      <p>CNHC is pegged 1:1 with the offshore yuan, known by its abbreviation CNH to differentiate it from China’s onshore yuan, which goes by CNY. Reserves for the CNH are kept at a Hong Kong depository institution.</p>
      <p>“This investment in CNHC is part of KuCoin Ventures' broader strategy of investing in the Web3 infrastructure in the APAC region,” Justin Chou, chief investment officer of KuCoin and lead at KuCoin Ventures, said in a statement. “Hong Kong has a well-established traditional finance ecosystem. With the regulation and new policy for next-generation digital assets, Hong Kong has a real opportunity at becoming the new crypto center of the world.”</p>
	    <p>CNHC is issued on both Ethereum and Conflux. On-chain data shows that Ethereum has 23 holders of the token and 102 transfers, while Conflux has 606 holders and 1,487 transfers.</p>
	    <p>Fan Long, co-founder of Conflux, said Conflux is capturing the majority of the volume here because of Conflux’s “regulatory compliance” in China.</p>	
	    <p>“The significance of CNHC stems from its capacity to connect traditional financial systems with the emerging Web3 landscape, especially amid heightened regulatory scrutiny in the U.S.,” he told CoinDesk in a note. “CNHC presents a practical alternative for businesses and users in search of compliant options beyond the U.S.-centric regulatory framework.”</p>	
	    <h3><strong>Hunting for a dollar alternative</strong></h3>
      <p>Stablecoins are overwhelmingly backed by the U.S. dollar. While there are stablecoins based on other world currencies such as the euro, pound, or other dollars like the Australian, Canadian or Singaporean variety, none come close to touching the volume of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins including USDT and USDC.</p>
      <p>On one hand, this has only re-enforced U.S. dollar hegemony. The next frontier of finance being denominated in dollars is largely a good thing as it extends U.S. rule making, CoinDesk columnists have argued.</p>
      <p>But at the same time, not everyone wants to follow U.S. rules, especially when they have no nexus to the country. Regulators in the U.S. are also hesitant to allow crypto full-fettered access to the American banking system until stringent federal oversight is established.</p>
      <p>The market itself is not a fan of the U.S.-centric concentration risk this presents. USDC, knocked off its peg for multiple days during the crypto banking crisis, only recently regained it but the smart money is skeptical.</p>
      <p>BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes thinks the answer to all of this is a bitcoin derivatives-based algorithmic stablecoin called the kakaDollar, though the market might be skeptical of the concept after the collapse of Terra last year.</p>
      <p>There’s certainly been a successful use case for the CNH in China’s offshore bond market, for bwhich it was built. But crypto is something else entirely.</p>
      <p>It’s not without its skeptics.</p>
      <p>Alex Liu, CEO of Taipei-based Maicoin, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk the RMB is too tightly controlled on- or offshore for it to work out.</p>
      <p>“I think the only real challenge for the U.S. dollar is the RMB. But not through crypto, and not through China’s CBDC,” he said, referring to a central bank digital currency. He said the real focus is oil traded in RMB-denominated contracts. “Most trade between Russia and China has been de-dollarized,” he said.</p>

	    <p>Samsung Electronics said on Wednesday it expects to invest 300 trillion won (US$230 billion) over the next 20 years as part of an ambitious South Korean national project to build the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing base near the capital, Seoul.</p>
	    <p>The chip-making "mega cluster", which will be established in Gyeonggi province by 2042, will be anchored by five new semiconductor plants built by Samsung. It will aim to attract 150 other companies producing materials and components or designing hi-tech chips, according to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.</p>	
	    <p>Samsung's new plants will be located near its existing domestic factories and will produce both memory chips used for storing data and higher-margin logic chips designed to perform a broader range of functions, the company said.</p>

      <p>A giant in the global memory chip business, Samsung is trying to expand its presence in advanced semiconductors, anticipating that demand will soar in coming years with the adoption of new technologies, such as 5G wireless networks, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.</p>
      <p>The semiconductor cluster is part of broader government plans announced on Wednesday to promote six key technology industries the country sees as most crucial for its export-dependent economy.</p>
      <p>Apart from semiconductors, they include rechargeable batteries, electric vehicles, robotics, displays and biotechnology. The government hopes to draw 550 trillion won in corporate investment on those projects through 2026.</p>
      <p>South Korea's plan comes as other technology powerhouses, including the United States, Japan and China, are building up their domestic chip manufacturing, deploying protectionist measures, tax cuts and sizeable subsidies to lure investments.</p>
      <p>In a meeting with economic policymakers and business leaders on Wednesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol described technology industries as the country's "key economic growth engines and security and strategic assets that are also directly linked to job creation and livelihoods".</p>

      <p>"(South Korea) has world-class manufacturing capabilities and technologies in various hi-tech industries such as semiconductors, secondary batteries, and displays, but (government) support and regulatory conditions have been insufficient", the Trade Ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Samsung, South Korea's biggest company, has seen its profit plummet in recent months as a weak global economy, rattled by Russia's war on Ukraine and high inflation, depressed demand for its consumer electronics products and memory chips.</p>
      <p>The company's profit for the three months through December fell near 70 per cent, partially because chip prices fell sharply as clients adjusted their inventories to reflect economic uncertainties.</p>
      <p>SK Hynix, another major South Korean chip maker, reported an operating loss of 1.7 trillion won for the October-December period, which marked its first quarterly deficit since 2012.</p>

Solana and Dogecoin led the Wednesday winners. The rise in cryptocurrencies accompanied a rebound in U.S. equities on Tuesday as concern about bank failures receded and February inflation data released the same day was in line with expectations.</p>
	    <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
	    <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin rose 2.10% in the past 24 hours to US$24,789 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, for a weekly gain of 11.39%. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly broke the US$26,000 ceiling on Tuesday evening in Asia and is now up almost 50% for the year to date.</li>
        <li>Ether gained 1.90% to US$1,706, rising 8.86% in the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Solana led the gainers in the top 10, adding 2.75% to US$20.93 for a rise of 3.12% for the week. The Solana Foundation introduced Ask Solana U on Tuesday, an AI-powered chat-like engine that aims to assist Web3 developers on the Solana blockchain.</li>
        <li>Dogecoin rose 2.74% to US$0.07478. The memecoin is up 0.85% for the seven-day period, but still down more than 7% from the beginning of March.</li>
        <li>XRP edged 0.54% higher to trade at US$0.3735, but is the only top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrency with a weekly loss, down 2.20%. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs whose payment network is powered by XRP,  tweeted on Monday that Ripple had some exposure to the failed Silicon Valley Bank. This was accompanied by a large flow of XRP transactions on the same day, according to crypto tracker Whale Alert.</li>
        <li>Crypto exchange Binance’s BNB rose 0.51% to US$309.51, posting a weekly gain of 6.88%. The world’s largest crypto exchange on Tuesday said it will halt its U.K. pound deposits and withdrawals by May this year, after its local partner for fiat on- and off-ramps said it was ending the service due to regulatory concerns.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 1.30% in the past 24 hours to US$1.09 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours gained 8.47% to US$101.54 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed higher on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.06%, the S&P 500 moved up 1.65% and the Nasdaq Composite Index posted the biggest gain of 2.14%.</li>
        <li>Efforts by U.S. regulators and President Joe Biden to calm markets seemed to have the desired effect after the collapses of U.S. banks at the weekend. First Republic Bank, which slid over 60% on Monday and was briefly suspended from trading, bounced back almost 27% on Tuesday, according to CNBC.</li>
        <li>Investors in U.S. equities and cryptocurrencies also gained some reassurance from the U.S. Labor Department’s February inflation report released Tuesday, which showed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.6% by month and 6% on year, all in line with expectations. Though still above the Federal Reserve’s stated goal to keep annual inflation below 2%, the data suggest inflation in the U.S. is moderating and may convince the Fed to ease back on interest rate hikes.</li>
        <li>After a raft of rate hikes last year and into 2023, U.S. interest rates are now between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 79.7% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this month. The chance of no rate increase is at 20.3%, a decrease from 35% on Tuesday.</li>

	    <p>RockX, a Singapore-based blockchain company, is looking to attract institutional investors to liquid staking with its new service, Bedrock.</p>
	    <p>As well as offering staking services to retail customers, Bedrock offers institutional-grade know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance to institutions looking to stake more than 32 ether (ETH)($57,000), RockX said in an email Wednesday.</p>	
	    <p>The company is initially targeting exchanges and wealth management platforms, with a view to attracting large funds and banking institutions further down the line, founder and CEO Chen Zhuling told CoinDesk in an interview. Crypto trading firm Amber Group, a RockX investor, will be one of Bedrock's first clients.</p>	
	    <p>Staking is a means of earning yield on digital assets, in which crypto holders can lock up their tokens to secure proof-of-stake blockchains in exchange for a reward. With liquid staking, investors keep their capital liquid and use their staked tokens as collateral by receiving derivatives.</p>
      <p>Last month, liquid staking became the second-largest crypto sector when its total value of assets locked reached $14.1 billion, surpassing the $13.7 billion held on decentralized lending and borrowing protocols. Liquid staking platform Lido Finance has become decentralized finance's largest protocol with about $10 billion worth of digital assets locked on the platform.</p>
      <p>The catalyst for liquid staking is the Ethereum blockchain's Shanghai upgrade, which will allow stakers to withdraw the ether (ETH) they have staked and for which they have accumulated rewards. The expectation is Shanghai will strengthen ETH by establishing a blueprint for staking protocols and give users more confidence in their sovereignty over their assets.</p>
      <p>However, there have been doubts cast on the appetite for liquid staking among financial institutions, particularly in the Asian market closest to RockX. David Cicoria, head of markets technology for digital asset custodian Hex Trust, recently said institutions are giving it a miss due to risks of depegging, hacks and lack of regulatory clarity.</p>
      <p>Zhuling agreed institutions do hold some of these concerns, but stressed the important distinction between custodial and non-custodial staking services. Bedrock falls under the latter.</p>
      <p>"We are not holding any ETH at all. All the ETH is held in a smart contract and then deployed to validators," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's very easy to tally how many coins are held in the pool and thence being passed on to validators, so there is no risk of inflation of the numbers or misappropriation of assets," he added.</p>

	    <p>Bitfinex and Binance are walking back technical support for Stargate Finance’s plans to reissue its stargate (STG) tokens, according to several announcements that came out this week. They will now promote the use of the protocol’s original STG tokens.</p>
	    <p>The crypto exchanges’ decision to eliminate support for the new STG tokens follows Stargate decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO) decision on Tuesday to pump the brakes on its plan to mint new tokens, according to a recent community proposal. At the time of that decision Stargate Finance had already begun disseminating the new STG tokens, according to data from Etherscan – a problem with which exchanges must now contend to eliminate security risks to STG token holders.</p>	
	    <p>StargateDAO initially voted in favor of reissuing all STG tokens by March 15 after it uncovered security risks posed by “illegitimate STG transfers from compromised Alameda wallets,” referring to the failed crypto trading firm where roughly 10% of STG tokens are held. However, the DAO abandoned those plans when liquidators of FTX, Alameda’s sister company, rebuked the plan, arguing it violated an automatic stay issued in the FTX bankruptcy case.</p>	
	    <p>"[The reissuance] was to try to help the safety of the tokens in question. This is now being challenged with the liquidators clearly not wanting them moved," StargateDAO’s latest proposal to unwind the token’s reissuance reads.</p>
      <p>As a result, Bitfinex and Binance are now revoking scheduled STG contract swaps on various blockchains. They have also taken steps to ascertain whether their users who have STG holdings are, in fact, holding original STG tokens and not reissued tokens.</p>
      <p>Bitfinex provided its users with a contract address on the Ethereum network against which they could check the validity of their STG tokens.</p>
      <p>"We would like to remind our customers that there are STG tokens with different contract addresses in circulation; therefore, please don't send any STG tokens to our platform other than the one with the above contract address to avoid losing funds," Bitfinex said in its post about the canceled reissuance.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Binance pledged to "swap [users’] new STG tokens back to old STG tokens" to mitigate security risks associated with the use of the new STG tokens.</p>

	    <p>In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger, House Committee on Financial Services Chair Rep.

	    <p>"The only thing that interfered, I think, with its passage was the anticipation that the house was going to change and it was going to be in the hands of the Republicans and they should take charge rather than those of us on the Democratic side," said Ranking Member Waters.</p>	
	    <p>Rep. Waters declined to give a timetable for the legislation, though she did reaffirm that she and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), are focused on stablecoin legislation and have bipartisan support to get it done.</p>

      <p>Meta Platforms Inc. META 7.25%increase; green up pointing triangle said it would cut roughly 10,000 jobs over the coming months, the Facebook parent’s META 7.25%increase; green up pointing triangle second wave of mass layoffs in what it says is an effort to be more efficient in a difficult economy.</p>
      <p>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an email to staff on Tuesday that the company would in the coming months conduct multiple rounds of job cuts, as well as cancel some projects and reduce hiring rates as part of what he has dubbed the “year of efficiency.”</p>
      <p>Company recruitment teams will be cut first, followed by restructuring and layoffs in its technology groups in late April, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Business teams will face layoffs in May, he added. The company will also stop hiring for about 5,000 open positions.</p>
      <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said his company must cope with a longer term change in the economy, marked by the end of low interest rates, growing geopolitical tensions and costly new regulations.</p>
      <p>“At this point, I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “Given this outlook, we’ll need to operate more efficiently than our previous headcount reduction to ensure success.”</p>
      <p>Meta said in a securities filing Tuesday that it expects to lower its annual expenses by roughly $3 billion from an estimated range it gave on Feb. 1. It now expects to spend a total of $86 billion to $92 billion this year, including the costs of its layoffs and restructuring, which it said could total $3 billion to $5 billion.</p>
      <p>Meta’s share price rose more than 7% in Tuesday trading to just above $194, far outpacing the broader market. The stock is up more than 60% so far this year, though well below its all-time high of more than $380 in September 2021.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s announcements come after Meta’s layoff of about 11,000 employees—or roughly 13% of its workforce—last fall, in the first broad head-count reductions in the company’s history. The new round of cuts is likely to add up to roughly the same magnitude as those layoffs, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p> 
      <p>The new rounds of layoffs are likely to hit non-engineering roles especially hard, and among projects that will be cut are some wearable devices that were in the works at Reality Labs, Meta’s hardware and metaverse division, the Journal reported.</p> 
      <p>While saying that layoffs were difficult, Mr. Zuckerberg in his email on Tuesday also described what he said were the advantages of a leaner organization, expanding on a new view of management for the current economy that he has been laying out in recent months.</p>
      <p>He said that many managers will “become individual contributors.” He also said that managers might now have up to 10 direct reports, rather than just a handful because the company now doesn’t expect to increase its head count as quickly as in the past.</p>
      <p>“It’s well-understood that every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “Every manager typically reviews work and polishes off some rough edges before sending it further up the chain.” He said the company will be “focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority” because those can take broader resources and managers’ attention from core priorities.</p>
      <p>“In retrospect, I underestimated the indirect costs of lower priority projects,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.</p>
      <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said the company analyzed performance data and found that engineers who joined the company in person before working remotely or remained in person performed better on average than those who joined the company remotely. The analysis also showed that engineers perform better on average when they work in person with teammates at least three days a week, he said. The company’s hypothesis is that in-person work helps build trust and is more effective, he said.</p>
      <p>He encouraged employees to find more time to work with colleagues in person. “We’re focusing on understanding this further and finding ways to make sure people build the necessary connections to work effectively,” he said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Meta reported a head count of 86,482 employees at the end of December, up 20% from a year earlier, but said that figure still included most of the 11,000 employees affected by the November layoffs.</p>
      <p>Meta’s new layoffs add to waves of job cuts that have roiled Silicon Valley, where tech giants are now retrenching after adding employees by the tens of thousands through the pandemic. Technology companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have cut thousands of jobs in recent months.</p>
      <p>Since 2022, layoff tallies at tech companies have reached nearly 300,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that is tracking job cuts in the industry. Broadly, employment in the information industry was unchanged between July and January, according to federal data. Total employment rose in that time.</p>
      <p>Meta said Tuesday that it plans to extend a hiring freeze and pause internal transfers in the company while the layoffs and restructuring occur. Those freezes will lift in each unit once the restructuring there is complete.</p> 
      <p>U.S. employees affected by the layoffs will get 16 weeks of severance pay, plus an additional two weeks for every year they worked at Meta, the company said. Outside the U.S., packages will vary depending on local laws.</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, according to a source familiar with the matter, as scrutiny mounts over the firm's sudden collapse and regulators scramble to contain the fallout.</p>
	    <p>The U.S. Justice Department is probing the sudden demise of the bank, which was shuttered on Friday following a bank run, the source said, declining to be named as the inquiry is not public. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a parallel investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probes.</p>	
	    <p>Spokespeople for the SEC, SVB and the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>	
	    <p>The investigation is in early stages and may not result in allegations of wrongdoing or charges being filed, the source said. Officials are also examining stock sales by officers of SVB Financial Group, which owned the bank, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Sunday said in a statement the agency is particularly focused on monitoring for market stability and identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors during periods of volatility.</p>
      <p>The rapid demise of Silicon Valley Bank and the fall of Signature Bank have left regulators racing to contain risks to the rest of the sector. On Tuesday, ratings agency Moody's cut its outlook on the U.S. banking system to "negative" from "stable."</p>
      <p>SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued this week by shareholders, who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit susceptible to a bank run.</p>

	    <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin, world’s largest cryptocurrency, gained 8.2% to US$24,404 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 8.8%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum rose 3.93% to US$1,677, after rising 6.72% on the week.</li>
        <li>Dogecoin strengthened 2.31% to US$0.07242, but lost 3.54% in the past seven days. Polygon’s Matic token gained 2.04% to US$1.16, after rising 0.83% on the week.</li>
        <li>USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization, rose 0.75% to US$0.999, but slipped 0.09% on the week. USDC had momentarily lost its peg to the U.S. dollar after the shutdown of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) but recovered after Circle, its issuer, announced a new partnership with Cross River Bank.</li>
        <li>“We expect the stress in the banking sector, and the wider impact on confidence, now will give the central bank [U.S. Federal Reserve] cause for pause on its rate hike program,” said Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group.</li>
        <li>The global crypto market capitalization gained 4.39% to US$1.07 trillion, while the total crypto market volume rose 16.93% to US$90.47 billion in the past 24 hours.</li>
        <li>All Asian equity markets dropped on Tuesday as investors braced for the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 2.27%, while South Korea’s Kospi fell 2.56% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 declined 2.19%.</li>
        <li>The Shanghai Composite lost 0.72% while the Shenzhen Component Index dropped 0.77%, despite China announcing it will resume issuing visas from March 15 as it eased its Covid-zero policy. Investors are also looking forward to a series of China’s economic indicators expected to be published on Wednesday.</li>
        <li>Investors also await U.S. inflation data later on Tuesday. The February consumer price index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, is expected at 6% on year, dropping from the 6.4% for the year that ended January 2023, but still well above the U.S. central bank’s 2% target.</li>
        <li>“Despite most warning signs flashing red, the U.S. has continued to defy gravity,” said Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at Schroders. “We still think that higher interest rates, which we now expect to peak at 5.25% in the second quarter of 2023, will lead to a recession. However, it is likely to be relatively short and shallow.”</li>
        <li>The Forkast NFT 500 index rose 0.7% to 4,064.39. Planet IX – Gravity Grade rallied 51.67% as the day’s biggest gainer, followed by EGoldMiner that strengthened 44.63%.</li>
        <li>European stocks traded slightly higher after a two-day sell-off. The STOXX 600 inched up 0.1% and Germany’s DAX 40 rose 0.53%, while Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.32% to a two-month low, as investors assessed spillover effects from the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank.</li>

      <p>Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schonberger joins the Live show to discuss Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte’s call on Congress for the urgent approval of stablecoin regulation.</p>
      <p>RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, turning now to Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger, who's been following this story all day and has more on this. Hey, Jennifer.</p>
      <p>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Hey there, Rachelle. That's right. Just spoke with Circle's Chief Policy Officer and Head of Strategy Dante Disparte, who is urgently calling on Congress to pass legislation to regulate stablecoins in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure that led their stablecoin to break the buck.</p>
      <p>In a conversation just moments ago, Disparte saying that he favors legislation from House Financial Services Committee Chair and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters. Disparte telling me, quote, "I have been uploading to the internet since 2019. And since 2019, there has been an ongoing persistent conversation about risk. And we've been met with complete inaction."</p>
      <p>"I do think if this is the digital assets Dodd-Frank moment, then it is the time to act. Just as it took 2008 to get comprehensive banking reforms, I think it's well past time that the US acts. And to act is not to ban innovation, it's to encourage responsible innovation. But there is a shortfall in action right now"</p>
      <p>Now, Disparte also told me it was a run on a bank that triggered a loss of confidence in a fully reserved digital dollar. He says, that's the irony. Whereas, with the Tarra LUNA blowup, he called that financial alchemy of the very worst kind. He says, the way Circle operates is more conservative than the Paypals of the world, and it was a loss in confidence in a bank that triggered a crisis and risk in Circle's business.</p>
	    <p>Now, Circle's stablecoin broke the buck after it revealed that it had a $3.3 billion in reserves tied up in Silicon Valley Bank, causing investors to dump the stablecoin. Circle pledged from its balance sheet over the weekend to make any holder whole If the bank didn't go through an orderly wind down. And that helped to restore that deep peg on the chain.</p>
	    <p>Circle holds 80% of its reserves in short term treasuries and 20% in cash. As a depositor of Silicon Valley Bank, Circle will be made whole by the FDIC. Now, Rachelle, Disparte told me that there is a serious policy conversation that needs to be had here. And that regulators' intervention over the weekend was the right move to stave off contagion. I will have more on our website on finance.yahoo.com. Rachelle.</p>

      <p>US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced Monday that it had reached a deal to buy biotech firm Seagen, specializing in innovative cancer treatment, for $43 billion.</p>
      <p>Pfizer is offering $229 per share in cash, and the companies expect to complete the transaction later this year or in early 2024, they said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Pfizer is deploying its financial resources to advance the battle against cancer," said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.</p>
      <p>"Oncology continues to be the largest growth driver in global medicine, and this acquisition will enhance Pfizer's position in this important space," Bourla added.</p>
	    <p>Seagen -- leading in the research, development and commercialization of cancer treatments -- is growing, with a 12 percent increase in revenue forecast this year to $2.2 billion.</p>
	    <p> Targeting cancer -</p>	
	    <p>The company, headquartered in Washington state, came to major drugmakers' attention with its work on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are "designed to preferentially kill cancer cells."</p>
      <p>The agreement has been approved by the boards of both firms, and will be subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.</p>	
      <p>A deal would have to pass heightened scrutiny from antitrust regulators.</p>	
      <p>The Biden administration has also been seeking to keep down drug prices.</p>	
      <p>Pfizer expects to finance the deal through $31 billion of new long-term debt and a "combination of short-term financing and existing cash."</p>	
      <p>For now, Pfizer Oncology has a portfolio of 24 approved innovative cancer medicines that generated $12.1 billion in 2022, it said.</p>	
      <p>The deal with Seagen would double Pfizer's early-stage oncology clinical pipeline, the pharmaceutical firm added.</p>	
      <p>"The addition of Seagen's world-leading ADC technology will position us at the forefront of innovative cancer care," said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief development officer of oncology and rare disease.</p>	
      <p>Seagen CEO David Epstein added that "the proposed combination with Pfizer is the right next step for Seagen to further its strategy."</p>	
      <p>According to reports, Pfizer competitor Merck was in talks with Seagen previously but these did not go through.</p>	
      <p>Pfizer expects that Seagen may contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030, "with potential significant growth beyond 2030," the company said.</p>		
	    <p>Seagen's portfolio includes three products with ADCs, including Padcev, which is used for the treatment of urothelial cancer.</p>
      <p>The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into combining Padcev with Merck's Keytruda in treating patients with advanced bladder cancer who are not eligible for chemotherapy.</p>

      <p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government has proposed an additional net expenditure of 1.48 trillion rupees ($18.06 billion) for the fiscal year ending this month, a government statement said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The additional gross expenditure for the same period will be 2.71 trillion rupees ($33.06 billion), the statement said.</p>

      <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished in the red this Monday as the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank's UK arm (SIVB) led to a weak start to the week on the markets.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 2.25% to close at 7,574 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris tumbled 2.58% to 7,034 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 2.66% to 15,017.</p>
      <p>Across the pond, US stocks started off the week with a sour sentiment before bouncing back after federal banking regulators took aggressive actions to stem the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.47% to 32,060 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.49% to 3,880 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 1.13% to 11,264.</p>
      <p>President Joe Biden addressed the nation on Monday regarding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Biden said that “no losses will be borne by the taxpayers” and he assured customers that they would be protected. The president also vowed to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen rules for banks.</p>
      <p>Biden explained that he instructed his team to protect US workers and small businesses and detailed their actions to protect customers' deposits and not put taxpayer dollars at risk, to hold those responsible accountable, and not to protect investors in the bank.</p>
    	<p>Back in London, HSBC (HSBA.L) bought the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank (SVBUK), securing the deposits of more than 3,000 customers worth £6.7bn ($8bn).</p>
	    <p>The Treasury said the deal with HSBC involved no taxpayer money and the Bank of England said deposits were secure.</p>	
	    <p>HSBC said it paid just £1 for SVBUK after the bank failed on Friday.</p>
      <p>All SVBUK services will continue to operate as normal and customers should not notice any changes, the statement said.</p>
      <p>"This acquisition makes excellent strategic sense for our business in the UK," HSBC said.</p>
      <p>"It strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the UK and internationally," Noel Quinn, HSBC group chief executive, said.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank — which specialised in lending to technology companies — was shut down by US regulators on Friday in the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.</p>
      <p>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “Today the government and the Bank of England have facilitated a private sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK. This ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased we have reached a resolution in such short order.</p>
      <p>“HSBC is Europe’s largest bank, and SVBUK customers should feel reassured by the strength, safety and security that brings them.”</p>
      <p>"HSBC shareholders may have some concerns about the bank snapping up assets which have been under such a cloud of uncertainty, particularly the exposure to bonds, but HSBC says it expects a gain to arise from the acquisition.</p>
      <p>"This will be hugely welcomed by the government, given the looming crisis risked overshadowing budget day, as a big tech sector bailout would not have been a good look when millions have been told there is little extra money to ease the cost of living crisis."</p>
	    <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: "It means that SVBUK will avoid insolvency proceedings and its customers will be able to access deposits and banking services as normal from today. European markets look set to open higher as a crisis in the banking sector is averted for now."</p>
      <p>Dom Hallas, executive director of Coadec, a lobby group representing UK tech start-ups, said Monday’s deal “saved hundreds of the UK’s most innovative companies".</p>
      <p>Financial stocks were among the fallers in London, with Standard Chartered (STAN.L) losing 6.52%, investment manager abrdn (ABDN.L) off 3.41%, and Barclays (BARC.L) falling 5.79%.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $82 per barrel amid concerns of further interest rate increases.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.11% to 27,832 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.98% to 19,702. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, climbing 1.20% to 3,268 points.</p>

      <p>The U.S. bank crisis deepened Monday as the financial industry continued to reel from last week's closing of vital venture capital lender Silicon Valley Bank and its parent SVB Financial (SIVB) Friday — marking the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. On Sunday, regulators shuttered cryptocurrency-focused Signature Bank (SBNY) and moved the assets to a bridge bank while agencies search for a buyer. Investors continued to dump bank stocks early Monday.</p>
      <p><strong>Bank Stocks Reel</strong></p>
      <p>Financial stocks continued to fall Monday as investors felt for the limits of the bank crisis triggered on Friday. Trading for First Republic was halted early Monday after FRC stock fell nearly 68% after the open to 26.45 after sliding roughly 15% on Friday. WAL stock trading was temporarily paused as shares of Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) toppled 80% Monday morning after shedding 20.88% Friday. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) was briefly halted as the stock plummeted nearly 52% Monday after collapsing 37.9% before the weekend. Zions Bancorp (ZION) retreated 34% Monday.</p>
      <p>First Horizon (FHN) trading halted early Monday as FHN stock fell 23% in the morning. And Regions Financial (RF) trading was paused after sliding nearly 6% Monday.</p>
      <p>Charles Schwab (SCHW) slid more than 16% Monday morning after losing 11.7% Friday. Bank of America (BAC) weakened about 4.3% in early trading after inching lower Friday.</p>
      <p>JPM stock pared early losses to less than 0.5% Monday. It climbed 2.5% Friday, one of the day's few banking bright spots.</p>
	    <p><strong>Bank Crisis: Signature Bank Closed</strong></p>
	    <p>On Sunday, state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank and appointed the FDIC as the receiver. Signature Bank is the 20th largest bank in the U.S. and roughly 30% of its deposits came from crypto customers.</p>	
	    <p>The FDIC transferred all deposits and "substantially" all of the assets to Signature Bridge Bank. The bridge bank is a full-service bank operated by the agency as it markets the institution to potential bidders.</p>
      <p>As of Dec. 31, Signature Bank had $110.4 billion in total assets and $82.6 billion in deposits. Signature Bank operations and banking activities will resume Monday, March 13. Regulators guarantee that, "all depositors of the institution will be made whole. No losses will be borne by the taxpayers." In a joint press release Sunday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg approved systemic risk exceptions for Signature Bank to soothe fears of a bank crisis.</p>
      <p>"Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system," the regulators wrote in the release. "This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth."</p>
      <p><strong>A Special Assessment On Banks</strong></p>
      <p>Regulators approved similar systemic risk exceptions for Silicon Valley Bank. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. In addition, officials removed senior management, according to the announcement. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law. And Sunday, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will make additional funding available to eligible institutions to assure banks have the ability to meet all their depositors' needs.</p>
      <p>"The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry," regulators wrote. "Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe."</p>
      <p><strong>First Republic Shores Up Funds</strong></p>	
	    <p>On Sunday, First Republic Bank (FRC) secured additional liquidity from the Federal Reserve Bank and JPMorgan (JPM) to shore up its operations. The additional borrowing capacity brings the total available, unused liquidity to fund operations to more than $70 billion, the company announced in a press release.</p>
      <p>"First Republic's capital and liquidity positions are very strong, and its capital remains well above the regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks," CEO Jim Herbert said in the announcement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on Monday, Bank of America removed its rating price target on First Republic, from its previous Buy rating and $90 price target. The unexpected bank failures resulted in First Republic "no longer trading on fundamentals," and made the previous targets unreliable, Bank of America wrote in a research note.</p>
      <p><strong>PacWest Operations Update</strong></p>
      <p>On Friday, following the Silicon Valley Bank failure, PacWest Bancorp released an operations update on its current liquidity. PacWest listed $41 billion in assets and $33.2 billion in deposits as of March 9. The Los Angeles-based bank lists $28.3 billion in loan balances, $1.9 billion in cash on hand, $5.3 billion in liquid securities and about $2 billion available from the Federal Reserve Discount Window.</p>
      <p>"Though the banking industry is experiencing significant volatility in light of recent events, we want to reiterate that Pacific Western Bank is a well-performing, well-diversified, full-service commercial bank with more than 20 years of history," CEO Paul Taylor said in the release. "We have been a proven partner to our customers through all economic cycles and are actively adapting in the current economic environment."</p>
      <p>Following the update, DA Davidson analyst Gary Tenner upgraded PacWest to Buy from Neutral on Monday, but lowered the price target to 29 from 31. The bank's financial update was largely in-line with the firm's Q1 expectations, despite contagion concerns, Tenner wrote in a research note.</p>

      <p>On the economic front, eyes will be on the consumer price index on Tuesday. The CPI is expected to rise 0.4%, both overall and excluding food and energy. That would bring the headline CPI inflation rate down to 6% from 6.1% in January, with the core inflation rate easing to 5.5% from 5.6%.</p>
      <p>Earnings continue trickling out at the tail end of the season this week. Among them are Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO), Adobe (ADBE), Dollar General (DG), FedEx (FDX), Five Below (FIVE), GitLab (GTLB) and Lennar (LEN).</p>
	    <p><strong>Stock Market Today</strong></p>

	    <p>Electric-vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) traded down more than 2% Monday morning after Wolfe Research downgraded the stock to peer perform from outperform. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were up after the stock market open.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and New Relic (NEWR) — as well as Dow Jones stock Salesforce (CRM) — are among the top stocks to watch in the new stock market correction.</p>
      <p>Palo Alto is an IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock. New Relic was recently an IBD Stock Of The Day. And Salesforce was featured in last week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</strong></p>
      <p>After Monday's market open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, and the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite erased sharp losses in morning action, with Seagen and Illumina leading the index.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.1% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) dropped 0.2% early Monday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield tumbled to 3.69% Friday. Then on Monday, the 10-year yield dived to 3.47% in early morning trade, as safe haven trade drove bonds sharply higher following the SVB collapse. The dollar angled lower, losing ground against the euro and the yen.</p>
      <p>Oil prices sold off Monday morning after Friday's brief bounce. West Texas Intermediate futures slid nearly 5% in early trade, trading below $73 a barrel early Monday. Gold and silver also moved sharply higher as investors sought solid ground. Gold jumped 1.4% to above $1,892 an ounce. Silver rallied 3.3%, clearing $21 an ounce.</p>
      <p><strong>Stock Market Correction</strong></p>
      <p>On Friday, the stock market sold off sharply, as the major stock index ended with big losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.45%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.8%.</p>
      <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "IBD changed its market outlook to 'uptrend under pressure' Thursday. And after Friday's selloff we've cut our outlook further, to 'market in correction.' This requires investors to avoid any stock purchases and pivot to defensive trading, such as taking profits and cutting losses short."</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Salesforce</strong></p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Dow Jones leader Salesforce showed big upside strength after strong fourth-quarter results. But those gains have mostly disappeared amid the recent market weakness, and now the stock is back below a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry. Still, the stock's recent strength is a reason to monitor the software leader in the coming sessions. CRM stock rose 0.5% Monday.</p>
      <p><strong>Top Stocks To Watch: Palo Alto, New Relic</strong></p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Palo Alto Networks continues to trade quietly in a handle after the stock's 12.5% surge on Feb. 22. Shares remain within striking distance of a base's 192.94 buy point. Bullishly, the stock's relative strength line is at new highs, as the stock sharply outperforms the market averages. PANW stock traded down 0.8% Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Backstory: On Feb. 21, the cybersecurity giant announced good results for the January-ended quarter that saw earnings hit $1.05 a share, up 81% vs. a year earlier, on a 26% jump in revenue to $1.7 billion.</p>
      <p>Recent IBD Stock Of The Day, New Relic, is working on a flat base with a 80.98 buy point in the aftermath of the Feb. 8 earnings-fueled surge. The RS line is holding up for now. NEWR stock was down 1.6% Monday.</p>

      <p>Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, lost and then regained parity to the U.S. dollar after regulators took over the failed Silicon Valley Bank and guaranteed deposits, including Circle’s, to prevent a broader run on the banking industry.</p>
      <p>USDC was trading at US$0.9948 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong on Monday, after falling to as low as US$0.8774 on Saturday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Circle held about US$3.3 billion in USDC reserve deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, known as SVB.</p>
	    <p>Cryptocurrencies also bounced back from losses last week, with Bitcoin jumping almost 10% in early trading in Asia, after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – a government body set up after the 1930s Great Depression to provide deposit insurance at savings and commercial banks – said on Sunday that it has taken over SVB.</p>
	    <p>The move to backstop SVB, which had total deposits of more than US$175 billion, went all the way up to the White House and President Joe Biden for approval at the weekend, according to a joint statement by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, indicating the seriousness with which U.S. regulators took the threat of bank failures spreading.</p>	
	    <p>The fall of SVB followed the earlier collapse of another California-based and crypto-linked bank Silvergate Capital last week. The FDIC said Sunday it has also taken control of New York-based Signature Bank, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto industry, due to banking industry risk.</p>	
	    <p>“Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,” the joint official statement said.</p>
      <p>“We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.”</p>
      <p><strong>Circle</strong></p>
      <p>Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO of Circle, said in a statement dated March 12 in Boston, U.S.: “We are heartened to see the U.S. government and financial regulators take crucial steps to mitigate risks extending from the banking system.”</p>
      <p>Allaire said the US$3.3 billion in USDC reserve deposits held at Silicon Valley Bank “will be fully available when U.S. banks open tomorrow morning. No USDC cash reserves were held at Signature Bank. As a regulated payment token, USDC remains redeemable 1:1 with the U.S. Dollar.”</p>
      <p>FDIC data shows SVB had about US$209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, making it the biggest bank failure in the U.S. since the 2008 financial crisis that included the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a 158-year old investment bank that is the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history with more than US$600 billion in liabilities.</p>
      <p>The FDIC in its Sunday statement said all insured depositors at SVB will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning in the U.S. and that the FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week.</p>
      <p>“As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors,” the federal agency said.</p>
      <p><strong>Crypto link?</strong></p>
      <p>New York-based Signature Bank was closed down on Sunday by its state chartering authority, with the FDIC appointed as receiver. At the end of last year, Signature Bank held total assets of around US$110.36 billion with US$88.59 billion in deposits, according to the FDIC.</p>
      <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted on Monday morning in Asia that the firm had about US$240 million in corporate cash at Signature as of Friday, and it is currently facilitating all client cash transactions with other banking partners.</p>
      <p>The U.S. bank failures could be seen as contagion from the crypto industry, but “the collapses of Silvergate and SVB didn’t appear to have direct links with cryptocurrency,” Winston Hsiao, co-founder and chief revenue officer of Taipei-based fiat-crypto exchange XREX, wrote on Sunday in a Facebook post.</p>
      <p>“Crypto firms are actually victims just like many corporates and individuals that deposited at the two banks,” he said.</p>
      <p>US President Joe Biden on Twitter said he is “firmly committed” to holding those responsible for the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapse “fully accountable.”</p>

      <p>As we laid out in last Friday's AAP Weekly Roundup, over the weekend a plan was hatched to stem the impact from SVB Financial (SIVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) via a joint statement released Sunday night by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

      <p>As we laid out in last Friday's AAP Weekly Roundup, over the weekend a plan was hatched to stem the impact from SVB Financial (SIVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) via a joint statement released Sunday night by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. This included the Fed sharing it "will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors."</p>
	    <p>Our view is this action is a Band-Aid approach to reassure depositors in order to prevent a repeat of what we saw late last week, but the fallout to come likely will see banks becoming more disciplined with their loan programs. This could pressure early-stage companies that are contending with the tech downturn, but it could also jump-start merger-and-acquisition activity in the coming months.</p>
	    <p>Given the speed with which this unfolded and the impact that Silicon Valley Bank had on the market -- with its $212 billion in total assets, $74 billion in total loans and $342 billion in total client funds as more than 2,500 venture capital firms banked with it and 15% of its loans were secured by residential mortgages and commercial real estate -- odds are there will be ripple effects. And there will still be questions over similar exposures at banks and other institutions tied to the venture debt market. That is going to raise questions about bank profitability, and indeed we are seeing some of those questions emerge today.</p>	
	    <p>We are also seeing the market question the Fed's next steps when it comes to monetary policy and its fight against inflation. Following the weekend's developments, the CME FedWatch Tool tells us the odds of a 50-basis-point move by the Fed next week is off the table, but we are still likely to see a 25-basis-point move. Without any fresh inflation data since Friday's February Employment Report, it's fair to say the market is thinking the Fed will factor the happenings of the last few days into its thinking.</p>	
	    <p>We are seeing a mixed outlook in equity futures this morning, with those for Nasdaq moving higher while the ones for the Dow Industrials and S&P 500 are bouncing back and forth between slightly up and modestly down. The yield for the 10-Year Treasury is also moving lower, hitting 3.515%, pretty much back to where it was in early February. What is climbing this morning, is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which is up double-digits to levels we haven't seen since late. October. This move along with the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index that fell sharply to Extreme Fear from Neutral over the last week suggests the next few days are likely to be volatile and potentially emotional for some investors.</p>
      <p>The next few days bring not only the February Consumer Price Index report as well as Wednesday's February Producer Price Index report but also the February Retail Sales report. If tomorrow's CPI data is more in line with the Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model that calls for headline CPI to come in at 6.2% in February with the core reading up 5.5%, showing little progress against January's respective readings of 6.4% and 5.6%, we could see the market react negatively as it once again rethinks what the Fed is likely to do next week. The key to is remember the Fed's dual mandate - stable prices and maximum employment. </p>
      <p>What this all means is the market will continue to trade day to day based on what is learned that day. Only once we get through the coming days will we have more answers that will tell us what is likely to happen. For now, we will sit on the sidelines, letting our cash, inverse ETFs and the position in gold via the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) fulfill their role in the portfolio. As we noted in Friday's Roundup, there are several holdings that have been hit, putting them back at more than interesting price levels. However, given a potential for the market to whipsaw in the coming days, we will bide our time for at least a bit longer.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, we would note that this Friday we have a triple witching event with the expiration of stock options, stock index futures and stock index options. This happens roughly four times a year and has been known to produce strong swings in the market. As we move toward that and digest the week's data we will also be closely watching the technical levels for the S&P 500 we shared earlier this morning. </p>

      <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell Monday, while Nasdaq futures rose after a flurry of news Sunday evening. The FDIC and other financial regulators announced that all SVB Financial depositors would get access to all funds Monday, while also announcing a plan to limit the contagion. Regulators also closed embattled Signature Bank (SBNY).</p>
      <p>Treasury yields plummeted while Fed rate hike odds faded, but bank stocks continued to sell off, including such as First Republic Bank (FRC), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) as regulators stressed their would be no bailouts for shareholders.</p>
      <p>President Biden will speaking on the banking crisis at 9 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>First Republic stock crashed more than 60% Monday morning, even after saying it got fresh funding from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan. Western Alliance also is off over 60% as well. Schwab lost 6% despite a Citigroup upgrade. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which found support on Friday, fell 1% even with a Wells Fargo upgrade. Bank of America (BAC) retreated 3%. The XLF financial ETF fell modestly and KRE regional bank ETF declined sharply.</p>
      <p>The stock market suffered big losses last week as SVB Financial (SIVB) and crypto bank Silvergate Financial (SI) collapsed, triggering intense losses for bank stocks. The major indexes sold off hard, breaking multiple areas of support during the week as many leading stocks also came under pressure.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
      <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.7% after surging more than 1% Sunday night. S&P 500 futures sank 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.%. Futures are active and volatile.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which dived last week on safe-haven flows, tumbled 21 basis points to 3.48%. But the 2-year Treasury yield plunged 50 basis points to 4.9%, as Fed rate hike odds fall.</p>
	    <p>Markets are now pricing in just one quarter-point rate hike, with a solid chance that the Fed will pause on March 22. A few days ago, markets expected 50 basis points on March 22, with at least two more quarter-point hikes after that.</p>
	    <p>Crude oil futures plunged 5%.</p>	
	    <p>Bitcoin rose sharply Sunday and largely held those gains Monday morning. The cryptocurrency tumbled last week on the Silvergate and SVB collapses.</p>
      <p>In other news, Pfizer (PFE) will buy Seagen (SGEN) for $229 a share, with an enterprise value of $43 billion, following weeks of talks. PFE stock fell modestly while SGEN stock leapt nearly 20%. Sanofi (SNY) will acquire Provention Bio (PRVB) for $2.9 billion, or $25 a share. SNY stock was little changed while PRVB stock more than tripled.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article discussed the market action in depth while also analyzing JPMorgan Chase, Palo Alto Networks and META stock.</p>
      <p><strong>FDIC, Regulators Protect SVB Financial Depositors</strong></p>
      <p>Shortly after Dow futures opened, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve issued a joint statement that SVB Financial's "[d]epositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13." They also announced that Signature Bank, which had a lot of crypto exposure, would be closed due to systemic risks. Signature Bank's depositors also will be protected.</p>
      <p>California regulators shut down SVB Financial and its Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary on Friday, the largest bank failure since Washington Mutual in the 2008 financial crisis.</p>	
      <p>The FDIC held an auction over the weekend for Silicon Valley Bank, with final bids due Sunday afternoon, according to multiple reports. No winner has been announced.</p>
	    <p>HSBC Holdings (HSBC) will buy SVB's U.K. arm for just over $1.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Fed is creating a new financial backstop for other banks. The facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks and other institutions. They'll have to pledge high-quality collateral such as Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Notably, that collateral will be valued at par, not mark to market. Banks have been sitting on unrealized debt losses as Fed rate hikes sent rates soaring over the past year. That was a big facto in SVB Financial's collapse.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of companies, including many venture capital and tech startups, have deposits or business ties to Silicon Valley Bank. There were reports that many will struggle to meet payroll without access to accounts soon.</p>
      <p>Notably, SVB and SBNY shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected.</p>
      <p>Stocks Near Buy Points</p>
      <p>Amid a weak, volatile, uncertain market, investors should not be making new position trades and instead be largely or entirely in cash. But keep an eye on stocks holding up near buy points. Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and United Airlines (UAL) are five stocks showing strength, near buy points. PANW stock has formed a handle on a long consolidation, while META stock has a new flat base. ULTA stock is finding support at key levels. Monolithic Power is working on a long cup-with-handle base while UAL stock has retreated from a buy zone.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has a new flat base as well. Tesla (TSLA) sold off hard this past week, but did find support at its 10-week line on Friday. TSLA stock is far from being actionable. Wolfe Research downgraded Tesla to peer perform on Monday, saying the SVB collapse adds to macro pressures.</p>
      <p>Insulet (PODD) will replace SIVB stock in the S&P 500 before Wednesday's open. PODD stock jumped Friday night.</p>
      <p>PANW stock is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist. MPWR stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders watchlist. Monolithic Power, United Airlines and ULTA stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <p><strong>Stock Market Weekly Action</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market started off higher but quickly reversed lower for major losses on Fed rate hike fears and later the SVB Financial and Silvergate shutdowns.</p>
      <p>Twice on Friday, stocks bounced as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed confidence in a "resilient" banking system. But the positive momentum quickly faded.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4.4% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index sold off 4.55%. The Nasdaq composite skidded 4.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dived 8%.</p>
      <p>Apple stock fell just 1.7% for the week to 148.50, holding above its 200-day line. But that's after reversing from Monday's intraday high of 156.30, nearly hitting AAPL's 157.48 buy point.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield plunged 29 basis points to 3.69% this past week, after hitting a 2023 high of 4.09% on March 2. The 2-year yield tumbled 27 basis points to 4.59%, including 31 basis points on Friday and 48 points on Thursday-Friday.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell 3.8% to $76.68 a barrel this past week, but did rise on Friday.</p>
      <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) plunged just over 6% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) slumped 3.4%.  The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gave up 5.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 3%, with MPWR stock an SMH holding.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) dived 10.9% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 11.4%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. TSLA fell 12.3% for the week, amid fresh price cuts and safety probes. But shares edged up on Friday.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) sold off 11.1% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 7.1%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 4.8, with UAL stock a key component. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 4.85%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gave up 5.3%.  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) slumped 3.85% to the lowest point since October.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dived 8.5%, with JPMorgan and SCHW stock big holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) plummeted 15.7%, its worst weekly loss since the Covid crash in March 2020. SIVB stock and Western Alliance are notable components.</p>
      <p><strong>Market Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market suffered damaging losses this past week, with the major indexes selling off hard and breaking through multiple support levels. The indexes tried to bounce back from early losses Friday, briefly turning positive, before tumbling to fresh lows.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 tumbled through their 21-day lines early in the week and finished decisively below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 finished Friday below the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones is at its worst levels since early November.</p>
      <p>Fed chief Jerome Powell's signal that he favors "faster" rate hikes hit the market on Tuesday-Wednesday. But SVB Financial and crypto bank Silvergate Capital rocked banks late in the week.</p>
      <p>A Friday morning rebound attempt fizzled as the FDIC announced SVB Financial's failure.</p>
      <p>If bank contagion fears grow, that would be grim for Wall Street and the economy. However, if SVB Financial's woes are seen as isolated and broader banking fears quickly fade, that could restore overall market confidence. But that would also likely send Treasury yields and the dollar rebounding higher, with Fed rate hike odds also increasing.</p>
      <p>The odds of a half-point Fed rate hike surged from 30% on Monday to over 80% following Fed chief Powell's testimony, then fell back below 40% on Friday. The odds fell further over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Leading stocks also sold off hard last week. A number of names held up for much of the week, but most of those were struggling by Friday's close.</p>
      <p>Up until Thursday, Friday's jobs report and the upcoming March 14 CPI inflation report seemed like major events. And they are still important. A relatively tame CPI inflation rate could give Fed chief Powell and his colleagues the excuse they need to raise rates by only a quarter-point.</p>
      <p>But in the very near term, Wall Street will likely take its cue from the banking sector. So pay attention to banks, from the biggest recent losers such as First Republic to broad ETFs and relative stalwarts such as JPM stock.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan was the S&P 500's second-best stock on Friday, even as SBNY stock, First Republic and Schwab were the worst performers. That's a sign that investors see JPMorgan as relatively safe. But if JPM stock breaks this past week's lows, that would be concerning.</p>
      <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market is selling off hard amid bad news and even-greater uncertainty.</p>
      <p>This is not a healthy environment. Investors should be largely or entirely on the sidelines, waiting to see how this shakes out. If conditions clear up in a few days or weeks, new buying opportunities will arise.</p>
      <p>Build your watchlists with a focus on the stocks showing strong relative strength. If they're near potential buy points like META stock, Monolithic Power or Palo Alto, great. But that's not the priority right now.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether led a strong price rebound in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies in morning trading in Asia as U.S. banking regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, both with ties to the crypto industry, and guaranteed deposits at the institutions as well as additional backstops for the banking industry. The moves followed the failure of Silvergate Capital last week that raised the threat of a systemic run on banks. Solana led the gains.</p>
	    <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
	    <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin jumped 9.60% in the past 24 hours to US$22,601 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether gained 9.77% to US$1,621.</li>
        <li>Solana surged 12.85% to US$20.38 to lead the gainers, but still has more ground to make up as it’s down 2.93% over the past seven days.</li>
        <li>USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization, traded back in line with its U.S. dollar peg in the Asia Monday morning after briefly losing the peg following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank where it holds about US$3 billion in deposits, according to Circle, the issuer of USDC.</li>
        <li>USDC fell to US$0.8774 on Saturday and its market cap slumped 15% to US$36 billion from US$43 billion. Circle said the same day the company had the funds to back USDC and it would remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. dollar. USDC recently traded at US$0.9941.</li>
        <li>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Monday that all Circle deposits will be available when banks open on Monday.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 6.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.01 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours was down 34.52% to US$60.19 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities slid on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.07%, the S&P 500 fell 1.45% and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.76%.</li>
        <li>The slump in equities followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by the FDIC on Friday, in the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. However, U.S. stock futures were trading higher on Monday morning in Asia, reflecting the moves to backstop the U.S. banking industry.</li>
        <li>Amid the banking scares, investors had to contend with the job report from the Labor Department on Friday that showed February nonfarm payrolls came in at  311,000, beating the projected 225,000. This furthers the narrative that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates more than previously expected to curb inflation.</li>
        <li>However, with banking failures now the center of attention and concern, analysts at the CME Group predict a 17.4% chance of a 50 basis point hike this month, a sharp drop from 60.9% last Friday. This reflects a view the Fed is unlikely to raise rates by that much in the middle of a series of bank failures.</li>
        <li>CME expect a 82.6% chance the Fed will raise rates by the forecasted 25 basis points this month, but other commentators say the Fed may postpone any hike until next month because of the banking industry jitters.</li>
        <li>The Fed meets on March 22 to make its next decision on interest rates, which are currently between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007.</li>
        <li>The U.S. annual inflation rate is 6.4% for the year ended January 2023, according to Labor Department data released on Feb. 14, which is well above the Fed’s long-term goal to keep inflation in a 2% band. The next inflation update is scheduled for March 14 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.</li>

      <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell $2 in volatile trading on Monday as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank hit equities markets and raised fears of a fresh financial crisis, but a recovery in Chinese demand provided support.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures were down $2.03, or 2.5%, to $80.75 per barrel by 1401 GMT. West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell $2.11, or 2.8%, to $74.57 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Brent earlier in the session hit lows last seen in early January while WTI touched prices last reached in early December.</p>
	    <p>Fears of contagion from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to a sell-off in U.S. assets at the end of last week, while state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank on Sunday.</p>
	    <p>Europe's STOXX bank index was down 5.8%, having shed 3.8% on Friday. U.S. authorities launched emergency measures on Sunday to shore up confidence in the banking system.</p>	
	    <p>"Investor sentiment towards these sectors will be hit in the near term. The crisis indicates that there continues to be sizeable risks in financial markets", said Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners.</p>	
	    <p>"Interest rates have moved a long way in a short space of time, exposing weaknesses across the global financial system."</p>
      <p>Market sentiment was already fragile as worries about further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve have been exacerbated by high U.S. crude oil inventories.</p>
      <p>In recent days a weaker dollar, which makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies, has lent some support to prices.</p>
      <p>Oil's fall follows positive momentum on Friday, when U.S. employment data surprised to the upside. Data for February beat expectations, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 311,000, compared with expectations of a gain of 205,000 in a Reuters survey.</p>
      <p>From a medium- to long-term supply perspective, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co on Friday said U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a fourth week in a row for the first time since July 2020.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- China’s efforts to ramp up lithium extraction could see it accounting for nearly a third of the world’s supply by the middle of the decade, according to UBS AG.</p>
      <p>The bank expects Chinese-controlled mines, including projects in Africa, to raise output to 705,000 tons by 2025, from 194,000 tons in 2022. That would lift China’s share of the mineral critical to electric-vehicle batteries to 32% of global supply, from 24% last year, according to a note on Friday.</p>
    	<p>The race to secure lithium is playing out at the highest levels, with nations including the US prioritizing access to the materials necessary for making batteries as the world turns away from fossil fuels. China’s needs are particularly acute because it’s home to the world’s biggest market for new energy vehicles.</p>
	    <p>The rise in Chinese output will include an increase in material derived from lepidolite, a lithium-bearing rock often overlooked as poor quality and environmentally unsound because of its low yield and high energy costs. UBS sees lepidolite in China accounting for 280,000 tons of lithium in 2025, or 13% of global supply, from 88,000 tons last year, as the government continues to support the sector.</p>	
	    <p>Beijing has already moved to curb unlicensed lepidolite extraction in Jiangxi province, a major mining hub, as it seeks to exert more control over its deposits.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The second-largest stablecoin in crypto fell from its intended $1 peg on Saturday, trading as low as 81.5 cents, hurt by the exposure of issuer Circle Internet Financial Ltd. to the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
      <p>USD Coin, or USDC, is a key plank of crypto markets and is supposed to hold a constant $1 value, fully backed by reserves of cash and short-dated Treasuries. But $3.3 billion of that roughly $40 billion stockpile is with Silicon Valley Bank, which has just become one of the largest US bank failures in recent history.</p>
      <p>Regulators seized the bank on Friday and investors are awaiting more clarity on the return of deposits. In that vacuum, USDC fell below $1, trading at about 92 cents as of 9:02 a.m. in London on Saturday. Smaller stablecoins such as DAI and Pax Dollar also fell from their pegs, a sign of wider nervousness.</p>  
      <p>The worries haven’t so far spread to top stablecoin Tether, which held at $1. Tether has previously faced scrutiny over its reserves. Wider crypto markets are having a painful week and were on the back foot Saturday: Bitcoin oscillated between gains and losses, while smaller tokens like Solana and Avalanche were in the red.</p>  
      <p>Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte described the fall of Silicon Valley Bank as a “black swan failure” in the US financial system, saying in a tweet that without a federal rescue plan there would be “broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs.”</p>
      <p>USDC has a circulating supply of about 41 billion tokens and a market value of roughly $37 billion, CoinGecko data shows. A net $2 billion of USDC was redeemed in the past 24 hours, according to blockchain research firm Nansen. Data compiled by Bloomberg indicated USDC traded as low as 81.5 cents.</p>
      <p>Coinbase’s Step</p>
      <p>Stablecoins like USDC are intended to hold a set value against another, highly liquid asset like the US dollar. They come in a variety of forms and some, like Circle’s, are underpinned by reserves of cash and bonds. Investors often park funds in stablecoins as they move between crypto trades.</p>
      <p>As the selloff in USDC worsened, US-based crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. said it would be “temporarily pausing” the conversion of USDC into US dollars during the weekend, and would resume on Monday when banks open.</p>
      <p>The fall in USDC has had a knock-on effect on decentralized finance applications which let users trade, borrow and lend coins and which tend to rely heavily on trading pairs involving the stablecoin.</p>
      <p>“Unless there’s a concrete bailout plan this weekend, I think markets will be ugly again next week,” said Teong Hng, chief executive officer at crypto investment firm Satori Research, about the failure of SVB.</p>
      <p>Crypto’s Woes</p>
      <p>The crypto sector was already reeling from a prolonged rout that’s knocked $2 trillion off the value of digital assets since November 2021, precipitating a series of implosions such as the TerraUSD stablecoin, the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund and the FTX exchange.</p>
      <p>The TerraUSD token — known as UST — tried to use a mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving a sister token, Luna, to hold its value. The $60 billion wipeout of that system intensified global regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins.</p>
      <p>“I think the market ‘panic priced’ USDC like it priced USDT around the Luna collapse,” said Haohan Xu, chief executive officer of Apifiny, an institutional trading platform. “It’s driven by Circle’s exposure at SVB plus Coinbase closing off its USDC convert function.”</p>
      <p>Trying to Reassure</p>
      <p>Crypto firms including Binance and Tether on Friday used Twitter to try to reassure their customers about any risks posed by the failed bank.</p>
      <p>Changpeng Zhao, chief executive officer at Binance, the largest digital-asset exchange, tweeted that the firm doesn’t have exposure and its funds are safe.</p>
      <p>Paxos Trust Co., issuer of Pax Dollar, and crypto exchange Gemini said they have no relationship with the bank, according to statements on their official Twitter accounts. Tether’s Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in a tweet that the largest stablecoin doesn’t have exposure to SVB.</p>
      <p>By contrast, bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi has about $227 million in an account at the failed bank, according to a court filing.</p>

      <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) lost its dollar peg and slumped to an all-time low on Saturday before recovering most of its losses after Circle, the firm behind it, assured investors it would honor the peg despite exposure to failed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
      <p>Circle said in a tweet on Friday it has $3.3 billion of its $40 billion of USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank. On Saturday, the cryptocurrency company said in a blog post that USDC liquidity operations will resume as normal when banks open on Monday morning in the United States.</p>
      <p>"As a regulated payment token, USDC will remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar", the company said in a blog post.</p> 
      <p>The cryptocurrency firm said that in the event the bank does not return 100% of deposits, it will cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.</p>  
      <p>The coin, which broke its 1:1 dollar peg and fell as low as $0.88 shortly after 0800 GMT (3 a.m. EST) on Saturday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, recovered to trade around $0.97 by 2100 GMT.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on Friday in the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, roiling global markets and stranding billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors.</p>
      <p>Circle said in a tweet on Friday that the company and USDC "continue to operate normally" while the firm waits for clarity on what will happen to Silicon Valley Bank depositors.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase said in a tweet it was not allowing USDC to be exchanged for U.S. dollars over the weekend while banks are closed, citing "heightened activity", while it plans to resume swaps on Monday.</p>
      <p>Joseph Edwards, investment advisor at Enigma Securities, said the situation was "extremely serious" for USDC.</p>
      <p>"No matter how sound Circle's operations are, this sort of depeg on a stablecoin tends to fundamentally undermine confidence in it," Edwards said.</p>
      <p>"The short-term implications here are dramatic and unknowable, especially once systems start to have to be adjusted to the reality that 1 USDC isn't trading at 1 USD for the time being."</p>
      <p>CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE</p>
      <p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a constant exchange rate with "fiat" currencies - those backed by a central government rather than a physical commodity such as gold - for example through a 1:1 U.S. dollar peg.</p>
      <p>Used in cryptocurrency trading, they have surged in value in recent years. USDC is the second-biggest stablecoin with a market cap of $37 billion. The largest, Tether, has a market cap of $72 billion, according to CoinGecko.</p>
      <p>USDC's price usually holds close to $1, making Saturday's drop unprecedented. According to CoinGecko data, its previous all-time low was around $0.97 in 2018, though in 2022 it fell just below $0.99 when cryptocurrency markets were roiled by the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.</p>
      <p>Traders have been on guard this week for signs of contagion in the financial sector and beyond from troubles for Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-focused Silvergate, which this week disclosed plans to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate.</p>
      <p>Boston-based Circle said last week it had moved a "small percentage" of USDC reserve deposits held at Silvergate to its other banking partners.</p>
      <p>The chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet on Friday it had no exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, as did Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin issuer Paxos and crypto exchange Gemini also tweeted that they do not have relationships with the bank.</p>

      <p>Coinbase (COIN) hit the brakes on conversions between USDC stablecoin and US dollars late Friday as fallout from Silicon Valley Bank's (SIVB) collapse spread into the heart of crypto trading.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, the crypto exchange said it was "temporarily pausing" the conversions while banks are closed over the weekend. The exchange said it planned to restart conversions on Monday.</p>
      <p>The pause speaks to the chaos that's roiled the crypto industry's second-largest stablecoin in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's demise on Friday. Speculating on the stability of USDC, traders redeemed $1.6 billion of USDC, lowering its total supply.</p>
      <p>Late in the day, Circle confirmed that $3.3B of the $40B backing its stablecoin was on deposit at the now-shuttered lender. The fate of that cash is now uncertain, with Silicon Valley Bank having been seized by the FDIC, and USDC – for the moment – has lost its dollar peg.</p>  
      <p>"Circle is currently protecting USDC from a black swan failure in the U.S. banking system," tweeted Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte late Friday night. "Silicon Valley Bank is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure – without a Federal rescue plan – will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs."</p> 
      <p>"During periods of heightened activity, conversions rely on USD transfers from the banks that clear during normal banking hours," Coinbase said in its tweet announcing the conversion pause. "When banks open on Monday, we plan to re-commence conversions."</p>

      <p>A 33% plunge in the previously high-flying Nasdaq Composite is the perfect time for growth investors to pounce on some amazing deals.</p>
      <p>While I hate being the bearer of bad news, stock market corrections are a perfectly normal part of the investing cycle. Since the beginning of 1950, the benchmark S&P 500 has undergone 39 separate double-digit percentage corrections, according to data from sell-side consultancy firm Yardeni Research. In other words, the drubbing Wall Street took in 2022 is par for the course when investing for the long run.</p>
      <p>When the major indexes crossed the finish line last year, it was the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) that was hit hardest. The Nasdaq, which led the broader market to new highs in 2021, shed 33% of its value in 2022 and continues to stew in a bear market.</p>
      <p>But there's a silver lining in this bad news. Though we'll never be able to forecast exactly when a bear market will occur or how steep the decline will be, we do know that every previous bear market in the major U.S. stock indexes (including the Nasdaq) was eventually whisked away by a bull market. It effectively means that every bear market is the ideal time to put your money to work.</p>
      <p>It's an especially lucrative time to go shopping for growth stocks. What follows are five stunning growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
      <p><strong>Nio</strong></p>
      <p>The first phenomenal growth stock just begging to be bought during the bear market decline is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO). Although supply chain issues continue to weigh on Nio's production expansion efforts, a number of headwinds have been safely put in the back seat.</p>
      <p>For the past couple of years, China stocks carried extra investment risk due to the country's zero-COVID strategy, as well as the possible delisting of China stocks by U.S. regulators. However, China has abandoned its zero-COVID strategy and reopened its economy. What's more, regulators gained hold of three years' worth of financial audits for Chinese firms, which removes the fear of delisting. In short, Nio is considerably de-risked from where things stood four months ago.</p>
      <p>But what's really been impressive about this company is its various forms of innovation. Nio has been introducing at least one new EV each year and has seen sales of its ET7 and ET5 sedans take off since hitting showrooms last year. With the exception of January, when production was constrained by factory closures as a result of the Chinese New Year, Nio has delivered in excess of 10,000 EVs every month since June 2022, with its sedans regularly accounting for more than half of those deliveries.</p>
      <p>Nio's out-of-the-box innovation is on display as well. In August 2020, the company announced the rollout of its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription. BaaS allows its EV buyers to charge, swap, and upgrade batteries at more than 1,300 power swap stations and more than 1,200 power charger stations. In exchange for a reduced EV purchase price, Nio nets high-margin, recurring subscription revenue from buyers via BaaS and keeps buyers loyal to the brand.</p>
      <p><strong>Exelixis</strong></p>
      <p>The second amazing growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is biotech stock Exelixis (EXEL). Despite occasional clinical trial failures, cancer-drug developer Exelixis is well positioned to grow by double digits.</p>
      <p>A little over a week ago, Exelixis announced that a late-stage study involving its blockbuster drug Cabometyx in combination with Roche's Tecentriq failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in a trial for patients with previously treated advanced kidney cancer.  But failures happen. It's part of being a drug developer.</p>
	    <p>What's far more important is that Exelixis has around six dozen clinical trials ongoing involving Cabometyx as a monotherapy or combination treatment for a variety of cancer types. It only takes a handful of success stories to significantly expand Cabometyx's sales and pricing power. We've already witnessed one of these studies finding the mark, which led to Exelixis and Bristol Myers Squibb gaining first-line approval for their combination treatment for renal cell carcinoma.</p>
	    <p>Furthermore, Exelixis has the cash to fund ongoing internal development, collaborations, and possibly even acquisitions. The company closed out 2022 with approximately $1.31 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and had another $756.7 million in long-term investments. </p>	
	    <p><strong>Walt Disney</strong></p>	
	    <p>A third stunning growth stock you'll regret not adding during the Nasdaq bear market drop is the popular "House of Mouse," Walt Disney (DIS). Though Walt Disney is a mature business, it's expected to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate for the next half-decade. That absolutely makes it a growth stock.</p>
      <p>The biggest competitive edge that Disney offers is that its business can't be duplicated. While there are other theme parks consumers can visit and other movies on the big screen, Disney's characters and stories, along with the emotion, engagement, and imagination they evoke in consumers, can't be duplicated by any other company.</p>
      <p>As I've previously suggested, the value of this irreplaceability can be seen in Walt Disney's pricing power. Since Disneyland opened its doors in Southern California in 1955, admission prices have risen by 10,300%. By comparison, the U.S. inflation rate has jumped a little over 1,000% over the same time span.  Disney has also been able to raise prices on its ad-free streaming service, Disney+, while losing only a small fraction of its subscribers. </p>
      <p>The next step in Walt Disney's evolution is turning its money-losing streaming segment into a profit machine. Newly reappointed CEO Bob Iger increased monthly subscription prices and is targeting profitability for this segment toward the end of fiscal 2024. Once streaming becomes cash-flow positive, I'd be surprised to see Disney stock anywhere near $100 per share.</p>
      <p><strong>Innovative Industrial Properties</strong></p>
      <p>The fourth magnificent growth stock that you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq's bear market swoon is marijuana-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). In spite of rent-collection speed bumps in recent months, IIP, as Innovative Industrial Properties is known, can show patient investors the green.</p>
      <p>The prevailing concern with IIP is that its on-time rental collection rate has dropped from 100% to 92% as of the end of February 2023. But it's important to understand that all REITs eventually deal with delinquencies. It's how companies handle their delinquencies that matters. IIP's fourth-quarter report and year-to-date update shows it's working through these delinquencies and should be able to sustain these revenue streams or outright sell these properties for cash.</p>
      <p>Another key point with Innovative Industrial Properties is that 100% of its properties are triple-net leased (also known as "NNN leased"). NNN-leased properties require the tenant to cover all expenses, including utilities, maintenance, and even property tax and insurance. While NNN leases reduce the rental income IIP can expect to receive, it also removes any chance of surprise expenses or inflation hurting the company.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Innovative Industrial Properties might be one of the few pot stocks benefiting from weed remaining illegal at the federal level. Since most cannabis companies have limited access to basic financial services, IIP has been able to work out sale-leaseback agreements that benefit both parties. Cultivators and processors get cash they sorely need from IIP, and IIP lands long-term tenants through this program.</p>
      <p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>
      <p>A fifth stunning growth stock that you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, autonomous vehicle company Waymo, and streaming platform YouTube.</p>
      <p>At the moment, advertising weakness is Alphabet's biggest headwind. When the probability of a recession materializing rises, advertisers pull back on their spending. But this is also a two-sided coin. Even though recessions are inevitable, they're typically short-lived. Buying ad-driven stocks during these short swoons often allows investors to take advantage of long-winded economic expansions.</p>
      <p>Alphabet's competitive advantage isn't going away anytime soon, either. Since December 2018, data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for roughly 91% to 93% of global internet search share. Having a 90-percentage-point lead over its next-closest competitor allows Google to command significant pricing power for ad placement.</p>
      <p>Alphabet's ancillary operating segments provide plenty of promise, too. YouTube is the second most visited social platform in the world, with Shorts getting more than 50 billion daily views. Meanwhile, Google Cloud has worked its way up to a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure-service spending. </p>
      <p>Based on both forward-year earnings and future cash flow, Alphabet is cheaper now than at any point since it became a publicly traded company.</p>

      <p>US stocks sank Friday, with a losing week capped by the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis and the prospect of higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 was on the verge of losing its 2023 gain as it finished closer to 3,839.50, where it ended after last year's 19% plunge. The index's financial sector was the worst performing on Friday as regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank to prevent a run on the tech-startups lender. The bank collapsed after this week saying higher interest rates spurred billions in losses on a $21 billion bond portfolio.</p> 
      <p>"Silicon Valley Bank was heavily reliant on the tech industry, catering mainly to startups and the investors that fund them. However, the insular ecosystem of startups and investors that it served took a hit when the Fed began raising rates to curb inflation," Thomas Smale, CEO of FEI International, wrote Friday.</p> 
      <p><strong>Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Friday: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>S&P 500: 3,861.72, down 1.44%</li>
        <li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: 31,909.83, down 1.07% (345.03 points)</li>
        <li>Nasdaq Composite: 11,138.89, down 1.76%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stocks had moved higher ahead of the opening bell after investors found some relief in the February jobs report.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department said the US economy added 311,000 jobs last month, much higher than expectations of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. But wage growth slowed to 0.2% from January's 0.5% pace, curbing expectations the Federal Reserve will upsize its March interest rate hike to 50 basis points.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Government-bond yields fell the most since since 2008 after a US bank failure spurred traders to reassess the outlook for additional Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Shorter-dated Treasury yields plummeted for a second day as traders reverted to pricing in a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s March 21-22 meeting, instead of a half-point move. The market also resumed pricing in a quarter-point cut by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The moves occurred even as US employment data released Friday showed job creation exceeded estimates for an 11th straight month in February, which prompted economists at Barclays Plc to forecast a half-point hike in March. The mixed data, which also showed wages rose less than expected, was overshadowed by the failure of SVB Financial Group, which buckled under the strain of declining deposits and losses on its securities portfolio.</p>
      <p>The two-year Treasury yield fell nearly 30 basis points to 4.57% at one point and ended near its session low. The yield’s two-day slide of just under 50 basis points was the biggest since 2008. Investors also piled into German short-term debt, sending those rates into a similarly steep decline.</p>
      <p>“It is incredible to see the whipsaw action in Treasury yields and it’s likely people want to own Treasuries into the weekend,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed-income strategy at Wisdom Tree Investments.</p>
      <p>Traders reasoned that the prospect of contagion in the banking system could curb the Fed’s willingness to keep raising rates despite still-elevated inflation. Swaps referencing the March meeting price in about 32 basis points of tightening, down some 13 basis points from earlier in the week. A rate cut by year end from the expected peak level had dwindled to less than a coin-toss in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>“The reaction in the market reflects the broader worry about US banks and investors did expect a beat in the payrolls number,” said Andrzej Skiba, portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management.</p>
      <p>Markets are jittery about potential fallout from the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, which has suffered losses on a portfolio including US Treasuries. Investors are turning their attention to risks that may lurk in other financial institutions — and questioning the degree to which the Fed’s rate hikes have precipitated that pain.</p>
      <p>US payrolls in February rose by more than expected while a broad measure of monthly wage growth slowed, offering a mixed picture as the Fed contemplates whether to step up the pace of rate hikes. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6% as the labor force grew, and monthly wages rose at the slowest pace in a year. Nonfarm payrolls increased 311,000 after a 504,000 advance in January, revised down from 517,000.</p> 
      <p>Traders will look to whether next week’s release of US consumer inflation data warrants pricing in a quarter- or half-point hike this month.</p> 
      <p>“The market is clearly reading that the labor report is solid but not strong enough for the Fed to re-accelerate the hiking cycle,” said Roberto Cobo Garcia, BBVA’s head of G10 FX strategy. “It would probably take very significant surprises in the CPI data next week for the Fed to change course again.”</p>

      <p>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</p>
      <p>The British pound initially plunged during the week to show signs of weakness, reaching down to the 1.1850 level again. This is an area that previously had been support, so the fact that we held there is a good sign. However, it’s also worth noting that we have seen a lot of choppy and noisy behavior as of late, and most of this reaction was due to the Non-Farm Payroll announcement on Friday, perhaps showing a little bit of hesitation in wage pressure. With that in mind, I’m a little less likely to get bullish of the British pound that I would be under normal circumstances, especially as the preceding candlesticks were all inverted hammers.</p>
      <p>I do believe eventually the British pound falls apart, and goes looking to lower pricing against the US dollar, but right now we might be settling on some type of short-term consolidation. If that’s going to be the case, keep in mind that markets can be extraordinarily choppy at times and you need to be cautious with your position size as a result.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the weekly candlestick, then I think it opens up a move down to the 1.15 level, something that I do expect to happen sooner or later. With that, I would be increasingly aggressive to the downside. If we do rally from here, I think there’s a lot of noise near the 1.21 level and the 1.2250 level where the 50-Week EMA currently resides. Either way, volatility is going to be a major issue.</p>

      <p>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</p>
      <p>The Euro has initially fallen during the week, only to turn around to show signs of life again. The 50-Week EMA seems to be attracting a lot of attention, so therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have turned around. Furthermore, we also had the non-Farm Payroll announcement come out on Friday that had people hoping that perhaps the shrinking wage inflation might have the Federal Reserve rethinking its rate of change. That of course is absolute nonsense, but in the short term it seems to be that’s the narrative that Wall Street is playing.</p>
      <p>If we can break higher, there should be a significant amount of resistance near the 1.07 level, and then again at the 1.08 level. On the downside, if we were to break down below the bottom of the candlesticks for the past couple of weeks, then I think you have a situation where you could easily see this market drop down to the 1.03 level, followed by parity. Keep in mind that parity is going to attract a lot of headlines, and therefore people will be very interested in that region. I think we will have a major fight if we do get down to that area, and whether or not we can break down below there is a completely open question at this point.</p>
      <p>At this juncture, I think the only thing you can probably count on is going to be more volatility, which is something that quite frankly I think a lot of traders are sick of. However, until we get some type of certainty when it comes to trading conditions and the economic outlook, this is a beast that we have to deal with.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin,the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 10.98% in the week from March 3 to March 10, to trade at US$19,941 at 9:00 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether slid 10.88% in the same period to US$1,397.</p>
      <p>The crypto market saw a turbulent week after New York State Attorney General Letitia James said Ether should be registered as a security in her lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin filed on Thursday, a day after crypto-friendly financial institution Silvergate Capital said it would cease operations and liquidate its banking unit.</p>
      <p>Investors digested hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said that the U.S. central bank may continue to raise interest rates this year to combat inflation.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin is still highly dependent on the monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and any words hinting an increase or decrease of the key rate can have an effect on its price,” wrote Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of blockchain software firm Encry, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>  
      <p>“The depreciation of Bitcoin should not be unexpected since inflation in the U.S. and the rest of the world has not gone away. The growth of Bitcoin in January and February was expected to stop and turn into a correction. Therefore, Bitcoin was expected to move into a downtrend,” wrote Nekrasov.</p> 
      <p>The Fed will announce its rate decision at the Federal Open Market Committee’s March 21-22 meeting.</p>
      <p>Alexander Politayko, the founder of MarsDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization developing deflationary products, said that he believes Bitcoin’s main support level is US$18,000.</p>
      <p>“If Bitcoin does not hold on to this level, then the market may witness another wave of panic sales, and Bitcoin could return to the levels of last fall at US$16,000,” wrote Politayko in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, data from investment platform MacroMicro suggests that more Bitcoin owners are deciding against selling their assets despite turbulent market conditions. The percentage of Bitcoin supply that has been dormant for at least a year rose to an all-time high of 67.84% last weekend.</p>
      <p>“There is a growing number of investors who view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but also as a store of value or tool for savings. This is significant because it indicates a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a purely speculative asset to one that has a practical use case,” wrote Politayko.</p>
      <p>“As more people begin to use Bitcoin for its utilitarian value, the demand for the asset as a means to store value is likely to increase. This, in turn, can affect the price of Bitcoin in a positive way,” he added.</p>
      <p>The global crypto market capitalization stood at US$923 billion on Friday at 9:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, falling 10.3% from US$1.03 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$385 billion market cap dominated 41.6% of the market, while Ether’s US$170 billion accounted for 18.5%.</p>
      <p><strong>Kava tops winners</strong></p>
      <p>Kava, the governance token of a layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Kava rose 7.18% to US$0.86, and surpassed Solana in the total value of assets locked in the network this week, according to DeFiLlama data.</p>
      <p>STX, the native token of Bitcoin smart contract layer Stacks, was the week’s worst performer among CoinMarketCap’s top 100, as it fell 33.54% to US$0.54. MINA, the token of privacy-focused blockchain Mina Protocol, followed closely as it fell 30.89% to US$0.61.</p>
      <p><strong>Next week?</strong></p>
      <p>Investors will be anticipating the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index data, a key indicator for inflation.</p>
      <p>In addition, the European Union will likely announce a 50 basis point rate hike next week, as predicted by 60 economists polled by Reuters. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the rate hike is “very, very likely.” The central bank’s interest rate is expected to rise to 3.00% as a result.</p>
      <p>The banking industry is bracing for ongoing challenges as the drop of Silicon Valley Bank’s shares, plunging over 60% on Thursday, prompted a domino effect, causing the market value of the four biggest U.S. banks to plummet by more than US$50 billion, raising widespread anxieties in equity markets.</p>

      <p>Oracle (ORCL) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reported earnings late.</p>
      <p>The stock market rally reversed sharply lower Thursday as questions about banks' financials suddenly came to the fore. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell to critical support levels.</p> 
      <p>Bank stocks plunged as SVB Financial (SIVB), parent of Silicon Valley Bank, cratered on a series of negative headlines while long-ailing crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) said it would shut down. Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) were among the high-profile losers.</p> 
      <p>SIVB stock continued to plunge late as fears of a bank run grew.</p>
      <p>Investors should be cautious, waiting for the market rally to show renewed strength.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Earnings</strong></p>
      <p>ORCL stock fell 5% overnight after Oracle earnings topped but revenue fell short. Oracle stock skidded 5.9% to 81.75 on Thursday, falling below its 50-day line. Shares have been working on a 91.32 buy point from a deep cup-with-handle base.</p>
      <p>ULTA stock edged lower in premarket action. Ulta Beauty earnings and revenue topped views, but same-store guidance was light. The beauty products retail giant dipped 0.8% to 519.93 on Thursday, just below its 21-day line. ULTA stock does not have a clear buy point.</p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p>Jobs Report</p>
      <p>The Labor Department will release the February jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect to see nonfarm payrolls up by 223,000, a big slowdown from January's 517,000, but that would still be a strong two-month start to the year. The jobless rate should hold at a 53-year low of 3.4%. Average hourly earnings should climb 0.3%, but the annual pay gain should pick up to 4.7%.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Labor reported initial jobless claims rose more than expected to their highest number since December. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that announced layoff plans are the highest to start a year since 2009.</p>
      <p>The February jobs report, along with next week's CPI inflation report, could lock in expectations for half-point rate hike on March 22.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
      <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.4% vs. fair value, but off overnight lows. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield sank 11 basis points to 3.83%. The 2-year yield slumped 11 basis points to 4.79%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures fell 1%.</p>
      <p>The February jobs report will be sure to swing Dow Jones futures, Treasury yields and Fed rate hike expectations.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <p><strong>Stock Market Rally</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market rally got off to a decent start Thursday on rising jobless claims, but soon reversed lower on bank concerns. The major indexes steadily worsened, closing near session lows.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index tumbled 1.85%, with SIVB stock, First Republic Bank (FRC) and Schwab the biggest losers. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.05%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has a lot of financial components, plunged 2.8%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.2% to $75.72 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 3.92%. The two-year Treasury yield plunged 16 basis points to 4.9%, while the six-month T-bill yield dipped 3 basis points to 5.28%.</p>
      <p>Fed rate hike expectations have shifted, but not decisively.</p>
      <p>As of early Friday, Markets see a 62% chance of a 50-basis-point move on March 22, down from Thursday's 68.3% and Wednesday's 78.6%. The odds spiked from around 30% before Fed chief Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony on Tuesday. Markets are now pricing in 75 basis points of rate hikes over the next three Fed meetings, with another quarter-point increase likely over that time.</p>
      <p><strong>Bank Stocks</strong></p>
      <p>SIVB stock plummeted 60% to 106.04, the lowest price since 2016. SVB Financial late Wednesday announced a $1.75 billion share sale. The Silicon Valley Bank parent also cut guidance. Deposits are dwindling due to startups facing a funding drought. There are also big concerns about SVB's loans to the tech industry.</p>
      <p>SIVB stock plunged over 60% in heavy premarket trade Friday. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is advising companies to pull money from Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported. SVB Financial still has to price that share offering.</p>
      <p>Silvergate Capital, which has been in free-fall for months, announced late Wednesday that it would shut down, with its Silvergate Bank liquidating. SI stock dived 42% on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The SVB and Silvergate news slammed financials, already under pressure as the extremely inverted yield curve upends the traditional borrow short/lend long lending strategy.</p>
      <p>KeyCorp (KEY), which warned on net interest margins earlier in the week, slumped 7.2% Thursday. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) tumbled nearly 13%, and FRC stock dived 16.5%.</p>
      <p>JPM stock skidded 5.4%. On Tuesday, JPMorgan fell below a 138.76 buy point and its 50-day line. BAC stock retreated 6.2% to its lowest levels since October. WFC stock also lost 6.2%, tumbling below its 200-day line after breaking below its 50-day earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>SCHW stock plunged 12.8%, gapping below the 200-day line and the low of its base. JPMorgan offered a block sale of 8.5 million Schwab shares, Bloomberg reported. SCHW stock is at its worst levels since October.</p>
      <p>On Friday, banking giants were little changed or edged lower after big losses Thursday and for the week. But FRC stock sold off again, with Western Alliance and KeyCorp also down</p>
      <p>Investors will take a much-closer look at banks' balance sheets and capital levels, something that hasn't been a real concern up until now. Banks are pushing up deposit and CD rates significantly, while long-term rates lag. Many banks are sitting on sizable unrealized losses on loans and other securities.</p>
      <p>If banks rein in lending, that could rapidly chill the economy. Meanwhile, SVB Financial and Silvergate Capital's woes raise concerns about their tech and crypto clienteles.</p>
      <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) tumbled 3.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slumped 2.3%, with ORCL stock a big IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gave up 1.9%.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 4.2% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 3.8%.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) shed 2.6% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) 2.2%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 3.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 1.6%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) retreated 1.4% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) 1%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) plunged 4.1%, with JPM stock, Wells Fargo, Charles Schwab and Bank of America all notable holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dived 8.2% to a three-year low. SIVB stock is a notable KRE holding, along with KeyCorp and Western Alliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Market Rally Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market rally had a highly negative day, with a downside reversal damaging the major indexes and leading stocks.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 opened by rising above its 50-day line, but soon hit resistance at the 21-day moving average and reversed lower to below its 200-day line and its March 2 low.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq initially rose above its 21-day line, but then reversed to below the 200-day line. The tech-heavy composite briefly undercut its 50-day before settling just above that level.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones knifed below its 200-day line to a four-month low.</p>
      <p>The Russell 2000 fell decisively below its 50-day line, all the way to its 200-day line.</p>
      <p>Some leaders held up, but most did not.</p>
      <p>Banking concerns triggered by SIVB stock, Silvergate and KeyCorp don't mean a financial crisis is on the way. Banks, especially the giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, are far-better capitalized than they were in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. But the fact that the words "financial crisis" are even being mentioned is a big shift.</p>
      <p>If banks rein in lending aggressively, that would hit the broader economy quickly. That also would raise the already-hefty risk that the Federal Reserve will overshoot rate hikes, triggering a hard landing. That also could spur the Fed to be more cautious with rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Friday's jobs report will be important, but it's the market reaction that matters. Keep in mind that if the economy suddenly stalls, lagging employment data won't offer a warning.</p>
      <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
      <p>With the S&P 500 and other major indexes heading south once again, it's not a time to add exposure. Investors should be looking to cut losses on recent buys that are struggling.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the market rally will once again find support with a tame jobs report or upcoming inflation data, but hope isn't a strategy. The key indexes are on the cusp of breaking decisively lower.</p>
      <p>On the upside, wait for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to retake their 21-day lines. If that happens, new buying opportunities will emerge. So keep working on those watchlists.</p>

      <p>Silvergate served the cryptocurrency industry, while SVB was the bank for Silicon Valley tech startups.</p>
      <p>It's a black week for the American financial system: In just 48 hours, the banking sector has been shaken by the collapse of two major banks.</p>
      <p>Most worrying is that these banks served two so-called growth economic sectors: the tech sector and the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
      <p>SVB Financial Group,  (SIVB) - Get Free Report the lender to Silicon Valley startups, failed on March 10, falling into the hands of the FDIC. The federal agency has taken control of the banking company, reviving the ghosts of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>"Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver," the federal agency said in a news release.</p>
      <p>"All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week. Uninsured depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds."</p>
      <p>It added that it may pay a dividend to uninsured depositors as it sells the assets of SVB</p>
      <p>The FDIC is a guarantor for bank depositors.</p>
      <p><strong>SVB: The To-Go Bank for Tech Startups</strong></p>
      <p>At the end of last year SVB had $209 billion in total assets and $175 billion in total deposits. SVB becomes the second biggest failure of a U.S. bank after Washington Mutual in 2008.</p>
      <p>SVB was a central player in the innovation economy. It was the backbone of the tech industry in Silicon Valley. It played an important role in the startup ecosystem by providing specialized financial services, industry expertise, a valuable network, and a strong reputation.</p>
      <p>It also offered a range of financial services tailored specifically to the needs of startups, such as venture debt, corporate banking, and asset management. These services are designed to help startups manage their finances, optimize their cash flow, and scale their businesses.</p>
      <p>SVB suffered from the rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve because it hurt the value of its investment assets, especially bonds. As a result, the bank had to resort to a capital raise as many startups withdrew their deposits from the bank since they were burning a lot of cash.</p>
      <p>SVB had to sell bonds, primarily U.S. Treasury securities, at a discount to cover these withdrawals. The rise in interest rates has made existing bonds less valuable. In selling these bond positions, SVB had to take a significant loss.</p>
      <p>But its attempt to raise $2.25 billion failed.</p>
      <p><strong>Crypto Bank Silvergate Collapsed</strong></p>  
      <p>Two days earlier, Silvergate, the crypto bank, collapsed. The bank was where most of the big crypto firms went, because traditional banks did not want to do business with them. And that reluctance stemmed from warnings from regulators who consider the crypto industry a risky sector.</p>
      <p>The company said on March 8 that it intended "to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate the bank in an orderly manner and in accordance with applicable regulatory processes."</p>
      <p>It added: "In light of recent industry and regulatory developments, Silvergate believes that an orderly wind down of bank operations and a voluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward."</p>  
      <p>"The bank’s wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits. The Company is also considering how best to resolve claims and preserve the residual value of its assets, including its proprietary technology and tax assets."</p>
      <p><strong>Verging on Bigger Fall Than 2008: Economist Schiff</strong></p>
      <p>The rout of the La Jolla, Calif., bank was due to pressure from regulators, in particular the Department of Justice, which has opened an investigation into its business relations with the empire of the former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
      <p>Bankman-Fried has been charged with 12 counts of fraud, stemming from the collapse of his crypto empire, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research.</p>
      <p>Silvergate was established in 1988. The bank initially specialized in lending to industrial customers and at the time also offered loans for both residential and commercial real estate.</p>
      <p>But in 2013, the bank began to court crypto firms, when traditional banks were reluctant to do so due to the opacity prevailing in the sector. Silvergate thus became the crypto bank. </p>
      <p>In 2019, the firm made its initial public offering, promising a complete refocus on the industry, which was then experiencing a renaissance. As of Sept. 30, Silvergate had $11.9 billion in digital assets held as deposits. </p>
      <p>But the bankruptcy of FTX and Alameda on Nov. 11 scared away customers. The bank thus reported only $3.8 billion in digital assets held as deposits as of Dec. 31. FTX was one of Silvergate's big customers.</p>
      <p>The question now is whether other U.S. banks will fall? Could SVB and Silvergate's issues spread to other regional banks especially since suspicion can lead customers to rush to these banks to withdraw their money?</p>
      <p>"The U.S. banking system is on the verge of a much bigger collapse than 2008," said economist Peter Schiff, known for his dire predictions. </p>
      <p>"Banks own long-term paper at extremely low interest rates. They can't compete with short-term Treasuries. Mass withdrawals from depositors seeking higher yields will result in a wave of bank failures."</p>

        <li>The EU will expand its liquefied natural gas import capacity to help ease supply bottlenecks.</li>
        <li>The bloc has also encouraged bloc companies to not enter any further LNG agreements with Russia.</li>
        <li>Despite trying to wean away from Russian supplies, LNG exports from the country increased in 2022.</li>
      </ul>
    	<p>The European Union is set to increase its liquefied natural gas import volume by almost a third in a continued move to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies.</p>
    	<p>Maros Sefcovic, vice president of the European Commission, tweeted on Thursday that the union was gearing up to add eight more LNG regasification terminals in the next year, up from 27 existing facilities.</p>	
    	<p>The extra infrastructure will help alleviate bottleneck concerns that the 27-member bloc experienced in the past year and provide the continent with more LNG for the future. The move will increase its regasification capacity from 178 to 227 billion cubic meters, Sefcovic tweeted.</p>	
	    <p>The announcement comes alongside remarks from European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson, directing European companies not to enter any new LNG trade deals with Russia, as the continent tries to completely shed Russian energy exports by 2027.</p>
      <p>"I encourage all member states and all companies to stop buying Russian LNG, and not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia once the existing contracts have expired," she said in an EU meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago sparked an energy war as Russia cut off its gas and oil exports to the continent in retaliation for Western sanctions.</p>
      <p>Though the bloc weathered the crisis thanks to a mild winter and increased imports from alternative suppliers, such as the US, it continues to depend on Russian LNG, and imports of the commodity increased by 35% in 2022.</p>
      <p>"We can and should get rid of Russian gas completely as soon as possible, still keeping in mind our security of supply," Simson said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the EU has continued to develop on-sea floating import terminals, or FSRUs, that have allowed it to import LNG from new suppliers without the construction of pipelines.</p>

      <h3>In this article:</h3>
      <p>Shell Plc SHEL, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, has recently withdrawn its involvement in the Salym Petroleum Development in Russia. This marks a significant moment in the company's history, as it has been operating in the region for over two decades.</p>
      <p>The decision to exit the Salym project was made as part of Shell's ongoing strategy to streamline its global portfolio and focus on areas where it can generate maximum returns.</p>
	    <p>The company has been divesting its non-core assets and reducing costs in recent years, in order to become more competitive and adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
	    <p>Salym Petroleum Development was a joint venture between Shell and Gazprom Neft, with the former holding a 50% interest in the project. The venture was launched in 1996 to develop oil fields in the West Siberian Basin and has since produced over 200 million barrels of oil.</p>	
	    <p>Despite its success, the Salym project was not considered a strategic asset for Shell, and the decision to divest was made after a comprehensive review of the company's portfolio. The withdrawal was completed on Dec 22, 2022, and the stake was sold to Gazprom Neft for $233 million.</p>	
	    <p>While the sale of the Salym stake will have a limited impact on Shell's overall production, it is an important step in the company's efforts to simplify its portfolio and focus on areas of higher revenue generation. Shell is currently investing in a range of new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energy and electric vehicle charging, as it seeks transition to a low-carbon future.</p>
      <p>The withdrawal from the Salym project also reflects the broader trend of international oil companies reducing their exposure to Russia, due to political and economic risks. Sanctions imposed by Western countries in response to Russia's Ukraine invasion in 2022 have made it more difficult for foreign companies to do business in the country.</p>
      <p>The withdrawal is also a clear indication of the company's commitment to strategic focus and adaptability in a changing industry. As the energy transition accelerates, companies will need to be proactive in adapting to the new energy landscape.</p>
      <p>Shell, a multinational energy and petrochemical company, headquartered in London, engages in the exploration, extraction, marketing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also produces gas-to-liquid fuels and other products.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h3>
      <p>Currently, Shell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the energy sector might also look at some better-ranked stocks like NGL Energy Partners (NGL) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Energy Transfer ET and Halliburton (HAL) both holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
      <p><strong>NGL Energy Partners:</strong>NGL Energy Partners is worth approximately $509.53 million. Its shares have increased 48.8% in the past year.</p>
      <p>NGL Energy Partners LP is a limited partnership company that operates a vertically-integrated propane business with three segments — retail propane, wholesale supply and marketing, and midstream.</p>
      <p><strong>Energy Transfer LP:</strong>Energy Transfer LP is valued at around $40.85 billion. ET delivered an average earnings surprise of 11.43% for the last four quarters, and its current dividend yield is 9.48%.</p>
      <p>Energy Transfer LP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.17. In comparison, its industry has an average forward P/E of 9.40, which means Energy Transfer LP is trading at a discount to the group.</p>
      <p><strong>Halliburton:</strong>Halliburton is valued at around $35.16 billion. In the past year, HAL stock has increased 3.4%.</p>
      <p>Houston, TX-based Halliburton Company is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, with a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 5.87%, on average.</p>

      <p>TAIPEI (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc.'s Google said on Wednesday it will launch a T$300 million ($9.8 million) fund over the next three years to help boost the Taiwanese media's continuing operations and digital competitiveness.</p>
      <p>Google has come under pressure in some countries to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, though not in Taiwan.Google said it will pay local publishers through what it calls a "Taiwan News Digital Co-prosperity Fund" to strengthen their digital publishing capability.</p>
      <p>The fund will help Taiwan local media "hone digital skills, gain expertise and support the sustainable development of Taiwan's news industry", the company said. "Even while Google faces many challenges in the overall international environment, Taiwan remains a crucial global stronghold," Tina Lin, managing director of sales and operations at Google Taiwan, told reporters in Taipei. Google said Taiwan's media industry has been facing major competitive challenges in adapting to the digital age, pointing out that advertising revenues for traditional media outlets have dropped 70% from 2003 to 2020. The initiative marks the latest effort by the internet giant to develop mechanisms to support and compensate regional news providers whose content appears on Google, as it faces the prospect that governments may impose regulations to require such mechanisms.</p>  
      <p>An Australian law giving the government power to compel Google and rival Meta Platforms to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets has largely worked, according to an Australian government report in late 2022.</p>

      <p>Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?</p>
      <p><strong>Why Does Debt Bring Risk?</strong></p>
      <p>Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.</p> 
      <p><strong>What Is Amazon.com's Net Debt?</strong></p>  
      <p>The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2022 Amazon.com had debt of US$85.1b, up from US$57.7b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$70.0b, its net debt is less, at about US$15.1b.</p>
      <p><strong>How Strong Is Amazon.com's Balance Sheet?</strong></p>
      <p>The latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$155.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.2b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$70.0b in cash and US$42.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$204.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.</p>
      <p>While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amazon.com has a huge market capitalization of US$958.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.</p>
      <p>We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.</p>
      <p>With net debt sitting at just 0.28 times EBITDA, Amazon.com is arguably pretty conservatively geared. And it boasts interest cover of 8.9 times, which is more than adequate. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Amazon.com if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 51% cut to EBIT over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.</p>
      <p>Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amazon.com recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.</p>
      <p><strong>Our View</strong></p>
      <p>While Amazon.com's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow makes us cautious about it, its track record of (not) growing its EBIT is no better. But at least its net debt to EBITDA is a gleaming silver lining to those clouds. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think Amazon.com's debt poses some risks to the business. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. While Amazon.com didn't make a statutory profit in the last year, its positive EBIT suggests that profitability might not be far away.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.</p>

      <p>Meta's rival to ChatGPT has been leaked online and is now available for download. Yahoo Finance investigates how much it differs from Microsoft and Google's AI alternatives.</p>
      <p>In February, Meta (META) unveiled LLaMA, their memorably-named Large Language Model competitor to Microsoft's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.</p>
      <p>At the time Mark Zuckerberg's tech-firm stated that they would only give researchers access to the artificial intelligence application, so as to "maintain integrity and prevent misuse".</p>  
      <p>Meta's initial release statement said: "To maintain integrity and prevent misuse, we are releasing our model under a noncommercial license focused on research use cases, and access to the model will be granted on a case-by-case basis to academic researchers."</p>  
      <p>However, someone has now leaked Facebook/Meta's Large Language Model alternative to the public via fringe online messaging platform 4Chan.</p>
      <p>After the leak, developers have taken the new chat-bot app out for a test drive, so what do we know so far?</p>
      <p>So far Meta's offering in the AI gold-rush to create the ultimate 'automated companion' for our journeys throughout cyber-space is similar in style to ChatGPT and Bard, with an ability to generate human-like responses to prompts and questions.</p>
      <p>According to popular AI newsletter The Neuron, "early testers are saying that LLaMA isn't as good as the models powering ChatGPT.</p>
      <p>"That's mostly because ChatGPT has anchored people to chat, and LLaMA wasn't taught how."</p>
      <p>On machine learning platform Hugging Face, one developer inquired, "anyone know how to get going with LLaMA?"</p>
      <p>Another platform released the code for LLaMA, on the popular website Github. Where developers had quickly used Meta's code to introduce 'ChatLLaMA', which was described as having a training process that was 15 times faster than ChatGPT.</p>
      <p>After the leak was detected Meta sent a takedown notice to Hugging Face, citing legal issues.</p>
      <p>Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun has also claimed that although LLaMA is a smaller AI model that uses less parameters than rivals it will be just as powerful, if not more, than other leading language models.</p>
      <p>Rivals ChatGPT and Google's Bard are trained following the scaling law, which attests that the more parameters the model has access to, the better the result.</p>
      <p>However, a paper released last month by Meta artificial intelligence researchers claimed that "although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of performance, a smaller one trained longer will ultimately be cheaper at inference".</p>
      <p>Within artificial intelligence technology, 'inference' explains how an AI model can use the data that it has been trained on to understand new information that it has never been exposed to before. In application, this gives the AI the ability to make decisions and evolve its understanding when fed fresh data.</p>
      <p>According to AI news outlet The De-Coder, Meta's alternative to ChatGPT "is more compact and faster and is even said to be on par with Google’s PaLM-E model".</p>
      <p>Google's PaLM-E combines language, speech and robotics, but has not yet been released.</p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p>What are Large Language Models?</p>
      <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured mass media headlines across the globe since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November, which has received investment from Microsoft (MSFT) to the tune of $10bn (£8.3bn).</p>
      <p>ChatGPT now has over 100 million users, the fastest application to mass adoption on record, and Microsoft has stated that the new technology will operate as a user's 'co-pilot' as they navigate the web.</p>
      <p>Large Language Models allow 'artificial intelligence' to generate content on request via a trawl of large data sets, in a matter of seconds.</p>
      <p>These generative-AI tools can produce haiku, jokes, corporate emails, business plans, fix computer code, write academic essays and even pieces of original fiction in the style of any writer you want, from Joyce and Dostoyevsky, to Shakespeare.</p>
      <p>Microsoft and Google (GOOG) are competing to build the best models to boost their search engines.</p>

      <p>In this article, we will discuss the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks. If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks.</p>
      <p>There has been a global energy crisis since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. European countries realized they heavily relied on Russian natural gas and crude oil and needed to transition away from these sources to reduce their dependence. During the conflict, the price of crude oil and natural gas spiked significantly due to global uncertainty, and the importance of oil and gas supply took center stage in the political landscape. As a result, there has been an acceleration in the installation of renewable energy resources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the capacity growth of renewable energy is set to double in the next five years. During this process, renewable energy sources will overtake coal and become the biggest energy source for the generation of electricity.</p>
      <p>The IEA anticipates the capacity of renewable energy to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) during the 2022 to 2027 period. The increase in the capacity growth of renewable energy is 30% higher than the forecast one year ago. This reflects the positive intent of governments around the world on transforming towards renewable energy sources. The IEA also notes that 90% of the increase in electricity capacity globally will be done through renewable sources, and as a result, renewable energy will become the biggest source of electricity generation by early 2025. IEA Director Fatih Birol shared that in the next five years, the world will add as much renewable energy as in the last two decades.</p> 
      <p>Besides Europe, India, China, and the US are also aggressively pursuing the rollout of renewable energy at various levels. The 14th Five-Year Plan rolled out by China in January 2022 focuses on making China a behemoth in the field of renewable energy, as the country will be responsible for nearly 50% of new capacity additions through renewable energy during the 2022 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 in the US intends to provide long-term support to the aggressive expansion and adoption of renewable energy by various corporations. Meanwhile, India is also set to increase its investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion between 2022 to 2027. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) are some of the most profitable renewable energy stocks in the industry currently.</p> 
      <p>A thorough research was conducted on the renewable energy sector, including its current market trends, growth projections, and key players, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and identify the most promising companies within it. We then shortlisted the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks on the basis of their trailing 12 months’ net income.

      <h3>KEY POINTS</h3>
      <ul><li>Amazon ads are the most effective and cheapest way to advertise online, making their ads more attractive for brands versus competitors.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The ad business is likely already its most profitable and valuable segment.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The best thesis for investing in this stock as the economy normalizes over the next year or two is its prowess in digital advertising.</li></ul>
      <p><strong>This technology conglomerate is building a sizable profitable ad business capable of challenging Meta's family of apps and Google's advertising empire</strong></p>  
      <p>It turns out that even mighty Amazon (AMZN 0.40%) is not immune to the adverse effects of inflation and rising interest rates. For example, its quarterly revenue growth rates for its North American and International e-commerce segments peaked in the first quarter of 2021. Even worse, both e-commerce businesses turned in an unprofitable fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
      <p>As for Amazon Web Services (AWS), revenue has consistently decelerated over the last several years amid intensifying competition and the law of large numbers, which states that the larger a company grows, the more difficult it is to achieve prior growth rates.</p>
      <p>For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2018, AWS grew revenue at 45% year over year, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, the cloud unit only produced 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Additionally, operating income for AWS dropped 2% year over year during the latest fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Since Amazon's primary growth engines offered investors little to be excited about since the first quarter of 2021, investors became fascinated with the growth potential of Amazon's nascent digital advertising business. However, since Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google ad business and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) family of app businesses, including Facebook, dominated the online advertising industry for about a decade, the question is whether Amazon's advertising business is worth investors' attention as a possible long-term growth engine.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look.</p>
      <p><storng>Its advertising unit is taking share</storng></p>
      <p>According to an article by Axios, which cited statistics from Insider Intelligence, Google and Meta combined in 2022 for a less than 50% market share for the first time in eight years. These statistics show that both companies are losing market share, and the prime cause is Amazon, which ended 2022 with a 7.3% digital ad market share. Still, analysts project its share to explode to nearly 13% by 2024, closing the gap with Meta's projected 17.9% share -- a drop from the 19.6% market share Meta achieved in 2022.</p>
      <p>Many advertisers are gravitating to Amazon ads since it's the most effective and cheapest way to advertise online.</p>
      <p>According to a Feedvisor report that cites a 2020 survey of over 1,000 brands, 36% of all brands say Amazon generates the highest return on media spend, followed by paid social at 29% and then Google at 27%. Even better, 59% of the brands on Amazon's e-commerce marketplace say that it drives the highest return on media spending, followed by Google at 22% and then paid social at 17%.</p>
      <p>As far as cost, according to a report from e-commerce analytics firm Sellics, Amazon ads are 68% cheaper than Google, 44% cheaper than Facebook, 79% cheaper than Instagram, and 13% cheaper than e-commerce competitor Walmart (NYSE: WMT).</p>
      <p><strong>Why investors are interested in its ad unit</strong></p>
      <p>While Alphabet's advertising unit and Meta's advertising lost approximately 4% year over year in revenue in the fourth quarter, Amazon's ad unit generated 19% year over year, despite an ad market that global media company Magna Global forecasts to slow further during 2023. And only the 20% revenue growth of the AWS segment was better for it in the fourth quarter. However, the prime rationale behind the investors' strong interest in the ad segment is that it is likely the most profitable piece of its business.</p>
      <p>While the company does not reveal the profitability of its ad business, analysts have roughly figured the profitability that Amazon gains in advertising by comparing it to Google and Meta's advertising units' profitability and using a few assumptions. Most analysts conclude that Amazon's advertising unit is more profitable than AWS.</p>
      <p>In addition, AWS also requires substantial capital investment, long-term investments in property, equipment, land, computers, and software needed to operate the cloud business. In its fourth-quarter 2021 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky revealed for the first time that just under 40% of its capital expenses go toward supporting AWS.</p>
      <p>Suppose that is true; in 2022, $25 billion of capital expenditures went into supporting AWS, while AWS only produced $22.84 billion in operating income in the same year. Amazon likely uses all of the AWS segment's operating income to pay the cloud unit's capital expenses. Thus AWS currently has a feeble free cash flow. And if you assume advertising is a less capital-intensive business, it produces better free cash flow than AWS.</p>
      <p>So however you want to parse it, advertising is a rapidly growing, profitable growth engine for Amazon that might already be its most valuable business.</p>
      <p><strong>A foggy short-term future</strong></p>
      <p>Amazon shareholders should understand that a recession would not benefit any of its businesses, including advertising, which relies substantially on the health of its e-commerce markets.</p>
      <p>Suppose you want to invest in Amazon stock for its long-term potential in advertising. Be aware that things could get much worse before getting better, and the ad business won't ride in to save the day.</p>
      <p>Still, as the economy normalizes over the next year or two, the ad business will likely become its most significant growth engine and a strong thesis for becoming a shareholder.</p>
      <p><strong>Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon.com right now?</strong></p>
      <p>Before you consider Amazon.com, you'll want to hear this.</p>
      <p>The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon.com wasn't one of them.</p>

      <h3>Key Points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Alphabet has been beaten down, with shares trading 40% below their highs.</li>
        <li>The company has a dominant and profitable core business, as well as some big potential growth drivers.</li>
        <li>With massive financial flexibility and an attractive valuation, Alphabet is worth a closer look.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>This dominant industry leader still has lots of growth potential.</strong></p>
      <p>There's a solid argument to be made for most of the FAANG stocks right now. Just to name a couple examples, Amazon trades for less than half of its recent peak, and Netflix recently reported subscriber numbers that were dramatically better than analysts were expecting.</p>
      <p>However, as we head into spring, there is one FAANG stock that looks like a particularly strong long-term opportunity while interest rates and inflation remain elevated and economic uncertainty persists: Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.42%) (GOOG 0.51%). The company offers a rare combination of maturity, profitability, and growth potential, and with shares down by about 40% from their highs, it looks like a bargain for patient investors.</p>
      <p><strong>A core business with maturity and growth potential</strong></p>
      <p>Roughly 90% of Alphabet's revenue comes from Google Services, and to be fair, this is a collection of relatively mature, ad-driven businesses. The dominant Google Search platform is the biggest component, but this also includes YouTube, Gmail, Android, Chrome, Maps, and other popular consumer-facing platforms.</p>
      <p>There could still be significant growth potential on this side of the business, but it's not likely to happen in the years ahead. However, Google Services is a collection of rock-solid dominant businesses that produces a reliable stream of high-margin revenue.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Google Cloud, which currently accounts for about 10% of the company's revenue, could be a major growth driver in the years to come. It provides business collaboration tools, cloud storage, database services, content delivery networks (CDN), artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, app platforms, and much more. In all, Google Cloud offers more than 150 different products.</p>
      <p>For the time being, Google Cloud is a relatively small part of the business, but that could change in the coming years. For one thing, Cloud is the fastest-growing part of the company, with revenue increasing 32% year over year in the fourth quarter. It is the only one of the big three cloud providers to gain significant share of the cloud infrastructure market in recent quarters (Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure are the leaders).</p>
      <p>Not only that, but the cloud market itself is expanding rapidly. The cloud computing market was estimated at $484 billion in size in 2022, but is expected to more than triple by 2030 to a $1.55 trillion opportunity. If Google Cloud can increase its market share, this could end up being a big growth driver.</p>
      <p><strong>Lots of optionality</strong></p>
      <p>There are a few other reasons Alphabet is my favorite FAANG stock right now. The "other bets" segment doesn't produce much revenue currently, but that could potentially change in the future. The Waymo self-driving vehicle start-up is especially promising, but there are also some start-ups in healthcare and artificial intelligence, among other industries. To be clear, I'd buy Alphabet even if nothing ever came of these businesses -- but it's a nice addition to the tech titan's future potential. And it also doesn't limit the company's acquisition potential to just organizations that fit into the Google Services and Cloud segments.</p>
      <p>Finally, it's important to consider Alphabet's stellar financial condition. The company has about $140 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet, which gives it tremendous financial flexibility, especially when you consider it generated nearly $60 billion in net income over past four quarters alone. Alphabet can fund acquisition opportunities, reinvest in innovation, or opportunistically buy back shares as it sees fit.</p>
      <p><strong>Should you add Alphabet to your portfolio before the second half of 2023?</strong></p>
      <p>At some point, inflation will decline back toward historic levels and the Federal Reserve will back off of its interest rate increases, which could be an excellent catalyst for industries like advertising. More economic certainty would likely translate into more ad spending across the core Google Services businesses and would also make enterprise customers more comfortable increasing their spending on cloud services. So while I think Alphabet makes an excellent long-term investment regardless of timing, it could be an especially opportunistic buy while the stock is still about 40% below its highs due to the current economic uncertainty.</p>

      <p>By Jonathan Stempel</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc has resumed its purchases of Occidental Petroleum Corp shares after a five-month hiatus, increasing its stake in the oil company to about 22.2%, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Berkshire paid about $355 million for 5.8 million Occidental shares between March 3 and March 7, according to the filing.</p>  
      <p>The purchases were the first Berkshire has disclosed since late September. It ended last year with a 21.4% stake.</p>  
      <p>In August, Berkshire won U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission to buy up to 50% of Occidental's common stock.</p>
      <p>Buffett's company now owns about 200.2 million Occidental shares worth $12.2 billion, based on Tuesday's closing price of $60.85.</p>
      <p>Those shares would generate about $144 million of annual dividends, following a 38% increase that Occidental announced last month.</p>
      <p>Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock that throws off $800 million of annual dividends, plus warrants to buy another $5 billion of common stock.</p>
      <p>Occidental ended January with about 900 million shares outstanding.</p>
      <p>Berkshire began buying large quantities of the Houston-based company's stock about one year ago.</p>
      <p>After its stake surpassed 20%, Berkshire adopted the equity method of accounting for its holdings, and now reports its share of Occidental's results with its own.</p>
      <p>Accounting rules normally require the equity method above the 20% threshold, reflecting an assumption that the holder might exert significant influence.</p>
      <p>Berkshire ended 2022 with $128.6 billion of cash and equivalents. It plans to keep a $30 billion cushion.</p>
      <p>Occidental's share price more than doubled in 2022, benefiting from higher oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Though fourth-quarter profit was lower than analysts expected, Occidental said it planned to raise capital spending this year and could repurchase up to $3 billion of stock.</p>
      <p>Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, consumer brands such as Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom, and other stocks including Apple Inc.</p>

      <p>Alphabet (GOOGL) closed the most recent trading day at $93.86, moving -1.34% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 1.53% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.72%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 3.27%.</p>
      <p>Coming into today, shares of the internet search leader had lost 7.55% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.34%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.28%.</p>
      <p>Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Alphabet as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $1.09 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 11.38%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $56.89 billion, up 1.56% from the year-ago period.</p> 
      <p>Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.12 per share and revenue of $246.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.28% and +5.48%, respectively, from last year.</p> 
      <p>Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.</p>
      <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.61% lower. Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Digging into valuation, Alphabet currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.58. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 25.2, which means Alphabet is trading at a discount to the group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, GOOGL's PEG ratio is currently 1.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.36 as of yesterday's close.</p>
      <p>The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 64, putting it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to grade how tech sector leaders performed this past earnings season amid labor trends, A.I. adoption, and TikTok facing legislative headwinds.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Meta planning another round of layoffs this week, that's according to reports from Bloomberg. Now, the move would add thousands more to the 11,000 workers that were cut from the social media giant last November. It is the latest in a tech industry that has certainly seen a massive contraction over the last several months.</p>
      <p>Here to break down how the major players are navigating this and who's coming out on top, Yahoo Finance's tech reporter Allie Garfinkle has that for us. Hey, Allie.</p> 
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Seana. So while I'm not a teacher, I want to break this down report card style because these companies are all in incredibly different positions. I want to start with Apple, who is at the top of the pack with an A. Now, Apple's earnings were actually not standard Apple. We actually saw a rare miss out of them this last cycle.</p> 
      <p>However, there's a key number that's really important here for how things are looking, and it's 2 billion devices. That is how big their install base is. I believe that's more than 20% of the world's population. So the iPhone install base is at an all-time high, and it's sending the company's services revenue to a record of $20.8 billion.</p>
      <p>What does this-- what does this all amount to? It says that analysts say that this bodes extremely well for Apple's future as they increase how much individual users spend. So not a standard quarter for Apple, but there is a lot of good news there. So we'll give them an A. Maybe we'll fudge it to an A-minus.</p>
      <p>Now, next is Microsoft. So Microsoft will get a B, slight top line B, slight bottom line miss, but they won the ChatGPT lottery. Now, while their cloud growth is slowing, it slowed to about 31%, just barely beating analysts' expectations, that $10 billion investment in ChatGPT came at exactly the right moment. So we're going to give them a B for foresight.</p>
      <p>Next, Amazon. Revenue beat, earned EPS miss. Amazon has a lot to prove here. They're really doubling down on cost cutting, and I'm giving them a C because of that cloud number. Amazon Web Services net sales came in missing. It was a $21.3 billion actual versus $21.76 billion expected.</p>
      <p>Now, that doesn't seem like a big miss. And to be fair, it is not. However, that has been a stalwart-- AWS has been a stalwart of Apple-- of Apple-- of Amazon's business for so long, that it is very important that they keep that growth up or come up with a new plan.</p>
      <p>And last, we have Meta, which is going to get a C. Yes, they beat key revenue expectations, and there are growing losses on the Reality Labs operation, hence the C. However, they are investing in a $40 billion stock buyback plan, and they're betting that this year of efficiency, this cost-cutting plan, is going to work. I'm withholding judgment for now, but they are certainly ready to bet on themselves.</p>
      <p>Of course, now Meta being in the news because they're reportedly set to do another round of layoffs that could affect thousands and could come as early as this week. That said, Meta is the only one we know is doing layoffs for the time being. However, given Jerome Powell's testimony earlier today that rates will continue rising, the macroeconomic climate that has been so difficult for so many of these companies will continue to be difficult, so we'll have to see how they navigate it moving forward.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: Very good. So, Allie, you mentioned the ChatGPT lottery being won by Microsoft. Let's shift to the other one, which is the TikTok ban boost, if you will. Who stands to benefit the most? Because you're young and I'm old and because you're our tech reporter, is it YouTube Shorts, therefore Google? Is it Meta with their Reels? Or is it even Snap, who's seen a really solid pop to start the year? Who's the closest to emulating it in terms of social media style?</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: That is a really good question, Dave, and I'll be candid. I think there are a couple of different answers, and we would have to have that whole scenario play out to really know who the winner is. That said, I'm going to actually throw my hat in on Snap here. Every analyst I've ever spoken to who's bullish on Snap has one key argument, and it's that it is essential for teenagers. And if that's like something TikTok has become known for, it's certainly something Snap is known for, definitely on Wall Street and, to be fair, among the teenagers I've talked to.</p>
      <p>So I'd say if there's anyone who's set to really benefit, I would put money on Snap. That said, YouTube Shorts is something Google has massively invested in. Meta has been preparing for the moment where, hopefully, TikTok is less of a competitor for a long time. I think we could see a massive shift in the competitive landscape. But I would say the biggest beneficiary could be Snap, and the market certainly seems to think so.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: That's an interesting take because I sat at a Celtics game with a 15-year-old the other day, and he was on Snap the entire time, not TikTok.</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: The kids love it.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: So, yeah--</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: The kids love it.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: --they really do. I'm curious--</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: They love it.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: --to see where they go from here. Allie Garfinkle, thanks so much. Good stuff.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gains to show signs of hesitation. At this point, it looks like we are trying to build up enough pressure to go lower, breaking down below the support. The market has continued to fail every time we get close to the 50-Day EMA, so it is more likely going to continue to be a situation where traders are fading the rally, taking advantage of US dollar strength.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA is also backed up by the 200-Day EMA, so therefore I think there are quite a few different players that look to short this market every time it tries to rally. Ultimately, this is a situation where if we can break down below the 1.1850 level underneath, then the market is likely to drop down to the 1.15 level underneath. The 1.15 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we have seen a lot of noise previously. That previous resistance should now end up being supported.</p>  
      <p>On the other hand, if we turned around and took out the 200-Day EMA, then it’s likely that we could go to the 1.23 level. After that, then we have the 1.25 level above, that is where we have the double top, which started at the 1.24 level. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, but I also believe that this is a market that has a major overhang, and therefore it’s going to be difficult for it to go much higher.</p> 
      <p>Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is going to remain tighter for longer when it comes to the monetary policy, and therefore it’s likely that we would see the US dollar continue to be strong in general. All things being equal, this is a situation where we continue to see a lot of downward pressure on each rally, and therefore I will be fading each one at the first signs of exhaustion. True, support has held fairly well so far, but it is only a matter of time before it gives way to all of this mounting pressure.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gains near the 1.07 level. The 1.07 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area where we have seen both support and resistance recently. That being said, the market also has been banging around between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which typically will mean that we have a lot of noise out there that is going to continue to be a problem.</p>
      <p>If we were to turn around and break down below the 200-Day EMA, which is basically at the 1.05 level, then it opens up a trap door to much lower prices, perhaps down to the 1.03 level, followed by the parity level. The parity level of course is an area that will attract a lot of attention due to the fact that it is a level that makes for a good headline number. However, I think at this point we’ve got a situation where we have so much in the way of noise and volatility out there that sooner or later the Euro starts to fall. After all, when you look at the chart you can see that we had fallen rather drastically from the 1.10 level. The last couple of weeks have been very noisy, but it’s also worth noting that it was kicked off by a massive shot lower.</p> 
      <p>Jerome Powell is speaking during the session, in front of the United States Congress. That could be a mover of markets, but we will have to wait and see. Either way, it looks as if the sellers are going to continue to take hold of this market, especially as we sold off so drastically from the 50% Fibonacci level of the massive selloff that occurred last year. I think we continue to see more of the same, and therefore I think it’s only a matter of time before we go lower. That being said, if we were to turn around and break above the recent highs, that could change everything but I would not hold my breath on that.</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen rather hard during the course of the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now well below the 0.67 level. At this point, the market is looking likely to go down to the 0.6650 level, which is an area where we have seen a lot of previous support. If we were to break down below there, then the market is likely to drop down to the 0.6450 level. Furthermore, we have recently seen the so-called “death cross”, when the 50-Day EMA breaks down below the 200-Day EMA indicator and is generally seen as a negative turn of events. Because of this, I think you got a situation where the market will continue to be more dollar positive than anything else.</p>
      <p>This will continue to be the case as long as the Federal Reserve has decided to be “tighter for longer”, as they have publicly stated. At this point, I think it’s only a matter of time before rallies get sold into at the first signs of exhaustion. With that being said, I like the idea of fading these rallies and taking advantage of momentum, as it continues to see a lot of noise. The Australian dollar of course is a very sensitive currency when it comes to global growth and of course the Chinese mainland, both of which are a bit shaky at the moment, despite the fact that the Chinese have less than desirable numbers at times.</p> 
      <p>The size of the candlestick does suggest that there is a significant amount of downward pressure building in this market, so I do think that a breakdown is only a matter of time before it actually happens. Rallies at this point will more likely than not be sold into at the first signs of exhaustion, and it would take the market breaking above the 200-Day EMA for me to change my opinion on this pair. All things being equal, I think the US dollar continues to be one of the favorite currencies around the world, and therefore I do believe that the Aussie will continue to be threatened by the juggernaut that is the greenback.</p>

      <p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, saw its share price rally almost 9% Tuesday, after a panel of judges appeared to be skeptical about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s arguments during an appeals court hearing, as Grayscale continues its push to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund. </p>
      <p>Judges at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., asked SEC senior counsel Emily Parise details about the connections between bitcoin BTCUSD spot and futures and markets, and questioned the agency’s...</p>
      <p>In June, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC over the agency’s denial of an application to convert GBTC GBTC, +2.64% into an ETF. The SEC has greenlighted several bitcoin futures-backed ETFs, but has yet to approve any ETFs backed by the cryptocurrency itself, citing concerns about market manipulation. </p>
      <p>The lawsuit filed by Grayscale is under the spotlight as it may shed light on whether and when a spot bitcoin ETF might be available in the U.S. Meanwhile, a successful conversion of GBTC into an ETF would help mitigate the discount GBTC has been trading at to its net asset value, or the value of bitcoins it holds. </p>
      <p>Launched in 2013, GBTC traded at a premium to its net asset value for several years, as it was for a long time the only public-listed fund that holds bitcoin as its primary assets. The premium flipped to a discount in February 2021, partly due to the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETF in Canada. However, investors can only sell, but not redeem their shares in the fund, in part as GBTC was structured similar to a close-end fund.</p>
      <p>To close the discount, Grayscale had lobbied the SEC and finally filed a lawsuit against the agency to push for a conversion from GBTC into an ETF. For an ETF, institutional traders can keep creating and redeeming shares, thus closing the gap between the fund’s price and the value of its underlying assets through arbitrages.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to the Court’s final decision, and strongly believe that American investors deserve to have equal access to the Bitcoin ETF product that best suits their needs,” a Grayscale spokeswoman wrote to MarketWatch in an email. </p>
      <p>China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (600900.SS) owns the Three Gorges hydropower electricity generation unit, which has the highest power generation capacity of 22,500 MW. Overall, the company has a power generation capacity of 71,795 MW and has more than 110 other hydroelectric power units under its portfolio. Not only is China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (600900.SS) the biggest supplier of electricity in China, but it is also the biggest publicly listed hydroelectric power generation and transmission company in the world.</p>

      <p>The dominance of Tethers USDT is rising among stablecoins amid an ongoing shakeup of the $136 billion stablecoin market.</p>
      <p>USDTs market share among stablecoins surpassed 54% on Monday, data from CoinGecko shows. This is the largest market share Tethers stablecoin has reached since late November 2021, after the crypto bull market reached its apex.</p>
      <p>Tethers gain came mostly at the expense of rival Binance USD, which has been in rapid decline since its issuer, Paxos, announced on Feb. 13 that it would halt minting new BUSD tokens due to pressure from the New York Department of Financial Services, the states top regulator. Since then, BUSD has shrunk below $9 billion from a $16 billion market capitalization.</p>  
      <p>USDTs market capitalization has grown some $5.3 billion this year so far to $71.6 billion, with $3 billion of the gains after mid-February. Circles rival stablecoin, USD coin (USDC), has also gained $3 billion since the Paxos announcement; however, its $44 billion market cap is still lower than at the start of 2023.</p>  
      <p>Stablecoins have become the backbone of the crypto economy in recent years, ballooning to a peak market capitalization of$188 billion in May 2022. They peg their price stable to an external asset, such as the U.S. dollar, and serve as a facilitator for trading on exchanges and making transactions between central bank-issued fiat money and the digital asset world.</p>
      <p>Tethers position as issuer of the worlds dominant stablecoin defies its historically opaque reporting about its reserves backing the value of USDT and heavy scrutiny of its internal dealings. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tether used bank accounts accessed by falsified documents in 2018. In September, a New York judge ordered Tether to present financial records on USDTs reserve assets in a lawsuit that alleges Tether conspired to issue USDT to prop up the price of bitcoin (BTC), CoinDesk reported.</p>
      <p>USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency with some $27 billion of trading volume in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, larger than BTC.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance’s David Hollerith joins the Live show to discuss the details around Binance’s reported plans to elude U.S. authorities and the expectations for Silvergate Capital.</p>
      <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
      <p>Crypto exchange giant Binance in focus this morning following a report from the Wall Street Journal that, amid the fear of prosecution, Binance had set out on a plan to neutralize US authorities. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on this story. He joins us now. David, what are some of the details here?</p>
      <p>DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, so Jared, just to take a step back, so Binance International is the world's largest crypto exchange. And Binance US is much smaller US regulated crypto exchange. There's been a long running discussion about the relationship between these two firms, and that's become notably a bigger deal as critics have pointed out. And since FTX has collapsed, there are a lot of similarities in terms of structure between the two firms.</p> 
      <p>Things reached a new boiling point on Friday, actually, in bankruptcy court. Voyager Digital is trying to sell its assets to Binance US, and notably, the SEC, the FTC, and several state securities regulators have actively been objecting. And sort of the bankruptcy court is trying to go through all this. So Binance US licenses the Binance brand and technologies, but is technically a separate legal entity, though, it's nonetheless majority owned by Binance's founder and CEO CZ.</p> 
      <p>As far back as 2020, there's actually been reports about sort of a connection to this, and even documents that have shown that Binance, at least, at one point in time, was thinking about trying to find a way to reach US investors without having to deal with US regulators. So the Wall Street Journal story from the weekend drew from chat logs from Binance employees, and this provided further evidence that Binance for some time has been potentially trying to find ways to use Binance US to reach US investors without having to deal with regulators. Reuters has also reported about this extensively, and they've also drawn-- as was in the Journal story, they've drawn a connection to Merit Peak, which was once a market maker for Binance US and is also owned by CZ, Binance's CEO.</p>
      <p>But notably from this story, I think, what was pointed out was the fact that the SEC Chair Gary Gensler was actually being recruited by Binance before he was chair of the agency when he was an MIT professor, and that's notable. If we are to believe the chat logs from Binance employees, it indicated that he was generous in offering licensing strategies to the companies. Obviously, this licensing agreement situation is the legal connection between the two firms. It's also notable as, on Friday, CZ, the founder, actually did a Twitter Space's AMA, and he sort of brought some of this to the public's attention, too, saying that he had met and previously known Gary Gensler, and that they had a good rapport. And he lectured for his MIT course. So this all just makes the connection between what's going on right now with Binance US and the SEC that much more interesting.</p>
      <p>It does, and speaking of connections, I mean, as we talk about the interconnectedness of this crypto world, as we know, one of the potential casualties that you've been watching is Silvergate. What can we expect to happen next with that sort of crypto focused bank?</p>
      <p>DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, Julie, you know, so for Q4, Silvergate fell into a situation, which is they were less than well capitalized or sort of on the brink of being less than well capitalized. There's a leverage ratio that is watched closely by banking regulators, and Silvergate was about 5.3%. Anything below 5% is a concern for regulators, and since then, Silvergate's come out saying they're going to be late on their annual report. Losses look worse, and obviously, last week, we saw the stock collapse by half between Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>So in this scenario, Silvergate is a bank. It's a state chartered bank, so it could go into something, which is receivership, which for banks, it's kind of like bankruptcy, not quite the same thing. And this would be decided by either the California State regulator or the FDIC, and in either situation, it would likely be the FDIC that would sort of take the mantle there.</p>
      <p>So we'll be watching that, but again, that's a worst case scenario. And Silvergate has fallen. It's lost so many deposits in the last couple of days. We are definitely expecting something like this to happen.</p>
      <p>Yeah, most definitely, and we'll count on you to keep watching it. Thanks so much, David. Appreciate it.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the course of the trading session on Monday, as it looks like it is still trying to figure out what to do with itself. Because of this, the market will be very noisy, but ultimately it looks as if we are going to have to make a bigger decision. Until we get some kind of impulsive candlestick, it’s a bit difficult to get overly aggressive in this pair. It seems as if the 1.20 level is going to continue to be a magnet for the price, therefore you need to pay close attention to how the market continues to react to this area. So far, it looks as if it’s ready to grind back and forth but if you look at the chart a little closer, you can recognize that there have been a series of lower highs along the way.</p>
      <p>Underneath, the 1.1925 level has offered a bit of support, and I think that probably extends down to the 1.1850 area where we had seen a little bit of support previously. Breaking down that level will then kick off the major leg lower, perhaps opening up a move down to the 1.15 level. The 1.15 level of course is very likely to continue to be important due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so with that in mind, I think it’s probably a nice target.</p>  
      <p>However, if we were to turn around and break above the 1.21 level, then it’s possible that we could go to the 1.24 level above, but that double top I think would be difficult to break above anytime soon and I think it extends all the way to the 1.25 level as well. In other words, there’s a lot of noise out there that is going to continue to be a major issue, so therefore I think you’ve got a situation where you have to look at this more or less from a “fade the rally” type of plan, but you should also perhaps look at this as a short-term market more than anything else at the moment.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Monday but continues to find plenty of buyers near the ¥163 level. The ¥162.50 level is an area that previously had been important as well, so I do think that there’s a lot of support underneath as it shows signs of importance. The 50-Day EMA looks as if it is ready to turn around and break above the 200-Day EMA, kicking off the so-called “golden cross.”</p>
      <p>The ¥165 level above is an area that could be a target as we pierced it previously, only to turn around and fall apart. Having said that, this is all about the Bank of Japan and the fact that there is going to be a continued need by the central bank to keep interest rates lower in that country. In order to do that, they have to buy bonds in order to keep interest rates from spiking in the country. In order to buy bonds, they have to print yen, and have promised to do so in “an unlimited amount.”</p> 
      <p>Ultimately, the market has been bullish for quite some time, and therefore I think momentum will continue to be part of the picture here. However, you should also keep in mind that recently when we spiked, we tested the top of a major selloff, and therefore I think it will continue to be a major target, but it is going to be so difficult to break above there that I do not anticipate that it happens anytime soon.</p>  
      <p>Short-term pullbacks should continue to be buying opportunities, but you should also keep an eye on the fact that the market is going to be very noisy not only due to the Bank of Japan noise, but the fact that the pair is also very sensitive to risk appetite, which of course is all over the place right now. Because of this, keep in mind that sometimes people will run to the yen when either rates overall drop, or if there is a major fear out there about some type of economic issue. I do believe that eventually we will have to make a bigger decision, but right now it seems like this can be more noise than anything else.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, as it looks like we’re going to continue to see a lot of noise in this pair. The 50-Day EMA currently sits at roughly 1.0675, and the market has tested that level. Ultimately, this is an indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to, but we are also between that and the 200-Day EMA, which typically means that you are going to see a lot of volatility in general. The 1.06 level is an area that a lot of people have paid close attention to recently, but I think that the support extends all the way down to the 1.05 level. The 1.05 level also features the 200-Day EMA, so it all ties together quite nicely.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, the market could drop down to the 1.03 level. The 1.03 level is an area that had been important previously. Ultimately, this is a market that continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, which makes quite a bit of sense considering that the economic situation seems to be all over the place. Ultimately, I think this continues to be a lot of noise more than anything else, but it is worth noting that we had seen a lot of selling pressure from the top. When you look at the recent high, you can see that the selloff began with 2 massive negative candlesticks.</p> 
      <p>If the rally did get to that area, I think it would be very difficult to break out above. Quite frankly, I see a significant amount of resistance at multiple levels. The 50-Day EMA of course is a major barrier, and then the 1.07 level is an area where we have seen resistance previously, and of course the 1.08 level. It’s not until we break above there that we can even begin to threaten those massive negative candlesticks where so much had changed in momentum. It is because of this that I think this pair ultimately remains a “fade the rally” type of situation, especially as inflation in the United States remains stubbornly high, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to remain “tighter for longer.”</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to look at the 0.67 level underneath as a potential support level. It has offered support over the last couple of days, so it does make a certain amount of sense that traders continue to come back into this picture. Furthermore, there is a little bit of support underneath there reaching down to the 0.66 level, and therefore I think it’s going to be difficult for this pair to simply fall through the floor. However, it’s probably worth noting that the market has been very choppy in general, therefore I think you probably continue to see a lot of back and forth trading more than anything else.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA has just broken back below the 200-Day EMA, forming the so-called “death cross”, then longer-term sellers may come in and hold short positions. That being said, the 0.68 level above could be resistance, right along with those moving averages. With that being said, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility, and therefore I would not hang on to a position for far too long, due to the fact that there are so many different things out there moving the market around.</p> 
      <p>Keep in mind that the Aussie of course is going to be very sensitive to the idea of global growth, or perhaps even the lack of it, and therefore you need to pay close attention to inflation numbers, and of course GDP numbers around the world. The Australian economy is highly levered to the Chinese economy as well, which although just reopening from the pandemic lockdowns, does not necessarily look blazing hot either, although in all fairness the Chinese economy is probably one of the better performers at the moment.</p>  
      <p>That being said, if the rest of the world is going to slow down, then the Chinese economy will of course suffer as a result. If we do break down below the support region underneath, it could open up a move down to 0.65 level, which is an area where we had seen a lot of noise previously. Breaking above the moving averages could open up a move to the 0.70 level, but that would take a significant amount of momentum.</p>

      <p>The average rate for mortgage offers clicked on by Bankrate readers Thursday was 5.38 percent, up 15 basis points from the previous week. Mortgage rates remain higher than they were a year ago, so it remains important to shop around if you want to find a good deal for a new loan or a refinance.</p>
      <p>Bankrate’s “clicked-on” rate reflects both purchase mortgages and refinances with all terms, including 30-year and 15-year loans.</p>
      <p>The best deals come with some caveats. For instance, to reel in the best combination of interest rate and costs, you generally need a credit score of 740 or higher and a down payment of 20 percent or more. Many of the lowest rates posted on Bankrate.com also require borrowers to buy discount points, a way of lowering the loan’s interest by paying a fee at closing — known as “buying down” the rate.</p>
      <p>Rates for mortgages change constantly, and they’ve recently risen. Those ups and downs reflect the volatility of the mortgage market as the economy continues to grapple with slowing-but-still-significant inflation and a looming recession.</p>
      <p>While it still might make sense to refinance your mortgage, the rationale has changed: Most refis now are being done by homeowners pulling out equity to pay for home renovations or repairs.</p>

      <p>By Alexandra Alper</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp's plans to sell technology to China's Huawei would be thwarted if the U.S. government proceeds with a proposal to further restrict shipments to the blacklisted company, a draft report by a government contractor shows.</p>
      <p>The Biden administration has been considering limiting the items it authorizes U.S. companies to ship to telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co, which was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 but which continues to receive billions in U.S. goods under a special plan implemented by the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>"The proposed 2023 amendment of (the Commerce Department's) licensing will likely have a high economic impact on Nvidia," according to excerpts of the draft report seen by Reuters, referring to the company's "pending license value."</p>
      <p>Nvidia's plans to sell to Huawei have not been previously reported.</p>
      <p>A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the document, saying: "The China market presents a significant opportunity for the U.S. semiconductor industry. While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”</p>
      <p>A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department "would not have approved of the report in its current form." It also said the government "has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions."</p>
      <p>The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>Reuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.</p>
      <p>The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a "moderate economic impact" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei "relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering."</p>
      <p>Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.</p>
      <p>Huawei was placed on the "entity list" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level" to be shipped to Huawei was "under assessment."</p>
      <p>But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- With artificial intelligence booming, one key player in the fast-growing space is talking to investors about raising more money after just reaching unicorn status in a funding round late last year.</p>
      <p>The parent company of Stable Diffusion, an AI tool for making digital images, is seeking to raise money at a valuation of about $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because it isn’t public. It isn’t clear how much capital Stability AI Ltd. is seeking to raise in the potential round. A final decision hasn’t been made on whether to go ahead with the financing and the valuation could still change, the people added.</p>
      <p>London-based Stability, whose investors include Coatue Management and Lightspeed Venture Partners, last raised $101 million at a valuation of about $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported in October.</p>
      <p>Representatives for Stability AI didn’t provide a comment.</p>
      <p>That it’s going back to market so soon amid a tech downturn at a much richer valuation underscores how artificial intelligence in recent months has become the hottest topic in Silicon Valley, with the potential to upend entertainment, finance and even education.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Corp., Bloomberg News reported in January, is investing $10 billion in OpenAI, the parent of ChatGPT, a leader in the technology, with tools that can generate uncannily detailed pictures, text and other media with a short prompt. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said Friday that he was stepping down from the board of OpenAI, as his venture capital firm increasingly invests in other AI companies.</p>
      <p>Other tech giants including Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also competing to get out front in AI.</p>
      <p>Stable Diffusion competes with OpenAI’s Dall-E 2, another digital-image tool.</p>
      <p>The way Stable Diffusion works is that people type in a description of an image — say an astronaut riding a horse — and the program spits out a realistic or surrealistic picture. The company says it stands apart from competitors because its open-source software is available to the public. Its practical uses include designing video games to advertisements.</p>

      <p><strong>China E-Commerce Giant JD Set for $1.4 Billion Discount Spree</strong></p>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. will offer discounts across its online shopping platforms from Monday in a 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) campaign to capture new users ahead of an anticipated Chinese economic recovery this year.</p>
      <p>The campaign has spurred concerns that larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. or upstart PDD Holdings Inc. may retaliate with cuts of their own, igniting a margin-eroding price war. JD announced the launch of the subsidy plan in a statement on its official WeChat account Saturday.</p>
      <p>China’s internet firms are revving up efforts to outdo each other since Beijing began to wind back its bruising crackdown on the tech sector, spurring an abrupt surge in competition that’s spooking investors. Meituan is said to be expanding into Hong Kong and has embarked on a campaign to hire 10,000 people on the mainland — an effort to beat back heightened competition from new entrants such as ByteDance Ltd. in the $145 billion Chinese food-delivery arena.</p>
      <p>JD shares tumbled after news of the impending rivalry surfaced in domestic media last week. Alibaba executives have since dismissed speculation it would directly engage its longtime rival, warning that a return to the price wars of years past was in nobody’s best interest.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Beijing launched a crackdown campaign to rein in what it called the “reckless expansion of capital,” affecting sectors from e-commerce to online education and the sharing economy. The government has begun rolling back restrictions since late 2022, intent on reviving a Covid-struck economy.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. partner Foxconn Technology Group plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in India to ramp up local production, people familiar with the matter said, underscoring an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.</p>
      <p>The Taiwanese company, also known for its flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., plans to build the plant to make iPhone parts on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public.</p>
      <p>The factory may also assemble Apple’s handsets, some of the people said, and Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business. Apple declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The investment is one of Foxconn’s biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China’s at risk of losing its status as the world’s largest producer of consumer electronics. Apple and other US brands are leaning on their Chinese-based suppliers to explore alternative locations such as India and Vietnam. It’s a rethink of the global supply chain that’s accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.</p>\
      <p>Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu, who met India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not comment on a possible Karnataka investment in a statement on Saturday outlining his visit.</p>
      <p>“My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships, meet old friends and make new ones, and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles,” Liu said. “Foxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders.”</p>
      <p>The new production site in India is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, the people said. The company’s sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs some 200,000 at the moment, although that number surges during peak production season.</p>
      <p>Output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain. Foxconn’s decision is the latest move that suggests suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected.</p>
      <p>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</p>
      <p>The plan may herald an accelerated relocation from China for Hon Hai. Once completed, we calculate this factory could materially improve the component supply in India and potentially boost the country’s share of iPhone assembly to 10-15 % from a sub-5% currently.</p>
      <p>— Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts</p>
      <p>Several government officials including India’s deputy tech minister tweeted confirmation of details around the upcoming plant on Friday, including that it will be built soon and create 100,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details, the people said. It’s also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities.</p>
      <p>The Karnataka state government also did not respond to a Bloomberg request for comment. Liu has committed to another manufacturing project in the neighboring Telangana state.</p>
      <p>Foxconn’s decision would be a coup for Modi’s government, which sees an opportunity to close India’s tech gap with China as Western investors and corporations sour on Beijing’s crackdowns on the private sector.</p>
      <p>India has offered financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which began making the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu last year. Smaller rivals Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. have also ramped up in India, while suppliers such as Jabil Inc. have begun making components for AirPods locally.</p>

      <p>(Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp said on Friday it made a "risk-based decision" to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network, its crypto payments network, two days after the digital asset-focused bank raised doubts about its viability.</p>

      <p>The Silvergate Exchange Network, one of the bank's most popular offerings, enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.</p>
      <p>Silvergate shares on Friday slumped more than 2% in after-hours trading, after closing up 0.9% at $5.77 in regular trade. The shares on Thursday had fallen to a record low, ending the day down more than 97% from their all-time high in November 2021.</p>
      <p>Silvergate on Wednesday warned in a filing that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern, disclosing that it had sold additional debt securities this year at a loss and that further losses mean the bank could be “less than well capitalized.”</p>
      <p>After the warning, cryptocurrency heavyweights including Coinbase Global Inc and Galaxy Digital dropped Silvergate as their banking partner.

      <p>Google is feeling the heat—from employees. With Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing making waves and Google’s answer to it, Bard, suffering a “demoralizing” demo last month, workers want to know the game plan with artificial intelligence and search.</p>
      <p>At an all-hands meeting Thursday, Google workers had the chance to pepper CEO Sundar Pichai and Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk with questions, according to CNBC, which said it obtained audio of the meeting.</p>
      <p>One worker asked the following question via Google’s internal forum Dory, according to CNBC:</p>
      <p>“Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”</p>
      <p>Krawczyk, making his all-hands debut, quickly responded, “I just want to be very clear: Bard is not search.”</p>
      <p>Instead, he said, it’s “a collaborative A.I. service.”</p>
      <p>“The magic that we’re finding in using the product is really around being this creative companion to helping you be the spark plug for imagination, explore your curiosity, etc.,” he said. But, he added, “We can’t stop users from trying to use it like search.”</p>
      <p>Of course, search is very much on the minds of Google investors and employees. When OpenAI shared its A.I. chatbot ChatGPT with the public in late November, thoughts immediately turned to how the technology might disrupt Google’s search dominance.</p>
      <p>Fears about that were hardly allayed when Microsoft launched a ChatGPT-powered rival to Google search last month. (It’s available to a limited number of users for now but will be more widely available soon.)</p>
      <p>Google responded last month with a video of a demo of Bard, but that was botched by a factual error from the chatbot concerning the James Webb Space Telescope. Wall Street promptly punished Google parent Alphabet, sending its shares down sharply.</p>
      <p>Another question on Thursday was about the demo, according to CNBC, with an employee asking, “The first public demo was demoralizing, sent our stock into a nosedive, and invited massive media coverage. What really happened?”</p>
      <p>“Questions like this can be fair and we want to reiterate the fact that Bard has not launched,” Krawczyk replied. “We acknowledged to the world that this is something that we’re experimenting with—we’re testing it. But there’s a lot of excitement in the industry right now.”</p>
      <p>Another worker reportedly commented, “Launching AI seems like a knee-jerk reaction without a strategy.”</p>
      <p>“I disagree with the premise of this question” Pichai responded, noting Google has been “working on A.I. for a long time.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, OpenAI was established in 2015 “as a counterweight to Google” in A.I., Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who helped start it, tweeted last month. He also complained that OpenAI had “become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” (Musk is now reportedly working to establish a rival to OpenAI.)</p>
      <p>But Google, though it’s long been strong on the A.I. research front, has much more to lose than anyone else if users start Googling less and turning to A.I. chatbots more for their search queries.</p>

      <p>MasterCard (MA) closed at $361.50 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.67% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 12.91%.</p>
      <p>Coming into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 5.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 5.68%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.54%.</p>
      <p>Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.70, down 2.17% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.61 billion, up 8.58% from the year-ago period.</p>
      <p>MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.13 per share and revenue of $25.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.9% and +12.55%, respectively.</p>
      <p>It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.</p>
      <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% higher. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MasterCard has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.32 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.8, which means MasterCard is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MA's PEG ratio is currently 1.68. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Financial Transaction Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.18 based on yesterday's closing prices.</p>
      <p>The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, putting it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- US stocks ended the week on a high note, driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates beyond peak levels already priced in.</p>
      <p>A rally in the S&P 500 Friday helped snap a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 scored its best day since early February. Sentiment remained upbeat despite a report showing resilience in the service sector, as some investors wagered the impact of the Fed’s hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers showed costs rising at a slower pace, which was cheered by traders.</p>
      <p>Bond yields rose for the week though Treasuries rallied on Friday, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.96%. A benchmark of the dollar had its worst week since mid-January, ending four consecutive weeks of gains.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls report next week for clues on whether the economy can handle more rate hikes. Data this week showed continued labor-market resilience in the US, supporting the case for the Fed to stick to its tightening policy, a theme that had pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.</p>
      <p>But investors were heartened after Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that the central bank could possibly pause its rate hikes sometime this summer. Traders interpreted his comments as dovish, even though Bostic and his colleagues said decisions would continue to be data dependent and a Fed report on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are in store.</p>

      <p>Traders are still optimistic because even the most hawkish Fed officials haven’t suggested that rates could need to go beyond levels already baked in, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. Swap markets have been pricing a peak Fed policy rate of 5.5% in September.</p>
      <p>“I think they stay at 5.5% and we have to see how data evolves in the second quarter,” she said on Bloomberg Television.</p>
      <p>Misra also added that robust data doesn’t mean the Fed’s persistent tightening isn’t working.</p>
      <p>“It takes a long time,” she said. “Policy only turned restrictive last year.”</p>

      <p>Risk sentiment also received a boost on Friday from forecast-beating factory data from China. Oil gained for the fourth day, with confidence in China’s robust rebound supporting prices.</p>

      <p>US stocks climbed higher on Friday, snapping a weekly losing streak as investors dialed back fears of aggressive rate hikes.</p>
      <p>All three indices ended the day higher, with the Dow gaining almost 400 points to break a four-week streak of losses.</p>
      <p>Investors digested comments from Federal Reserve officials on the central bank's next policy move. Though Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller said interest rates could tread higher than markets were currently expecting, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic signaled for just a 25 basis-point hike in March, spurring a rally in stocks during the session on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from the key 4% level, falling 11 basis points on Friday to 3.96%.</p>
      <p>However, ISM manufacturing data ticked higher, from 47.4 to 47.7 last month, a sign that manufacturing activity is still expanding despite the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</p>
      <p>"The solid ISM survey and resilience to high interest rates will reinforce the Fed's resolve that interest rates should continue to move higher. Even so, the Fed is unlikely to go back to rate hikes of more than a quarter percent per decision," Comercia Bank chief economist Bill Adams said in a statement. "The Fed wants to tread lightly to minimize the risk that they overshoot and cause an unnecessarily severe downturn."</p>

      <p><strong>Stock Traders Are Ignoring Blaring Bond Alarms</strong></p>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The fixed-income market’s unblemished record of striking fear into the hearts of equity traders is in danger.</p>
      <p>With rates on two- and 10-year Treasuries up a sixth straight week, and payouts on cash at or above the earnings yield of the S&P 500, stock investors are barely registering a shrug. Benchmark US share indexes just posted their biggest runup in a month, climaxing Friday with a jump in the Nasdaq 100 that topped any since early February.</p>
      <p>Why peace is breaking out in risky assets during a week that at one point saw yields in the entire Treasury market rise above 4% is a mystery Wall Street has no easy answer for. Charts may be one reason: the S&P 500 bounced sharply after falling below its 200-day average on Wednesday. Another may be that investors are interpreting elevated rates as a sign strong economic data is likely to persist, says Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance LLC.</p>
      <p>“It’s interesting to see stocks whistling past the graveyard,” Zaccarelli said. “Stock investors may be looking for yields to drop as a sign we are going to have a recession and are seeing an all-clear in the sense that rates are higher.”</p>
      <p>The indifference to calamity on display in stocks was particularly vivid as the week ended. Friday’s 1.6% gain in the S&P 500 pushed the Cboe Volatility Index below 19, testing lows hit when equities surged at the start of the year. A basket of most-shorted stocks rose 3.2% — it’s fifth straight advance — while a gauge of unprofitable technology companies vaulted almost 6%.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-84-1.webp" alt="ncx-blogs"/>
      <p>It’s happening even as money cascades out of stock-focused ETFs and into fixed-income funds, as risk-free yields reach multi-year highs. Short-dated Treasury bills are enticing investors as yields push above 5%, eclipsing the payout on everything from profits generated by S&P 500 companies to those offered by the traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p>
      <p>But while the trade is touted as risk free, it comes with opportunity costs. Grasping for a 5% yield right in an S&P 500 bear market strikes certain money managers as an iffy proposition.</p>
      <p>“That short rate isn’t going to be at those levels forever — it’s probably going to end up lower,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. “What we’ve seen over long periods of time is that the long-term assets outperform cash. And we have every reason to believe that’s going to be the case.”</p>
      <p>Over the past year, the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill exchange-traded fund (ticker BIL) has returned about 2%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 6.3% on a total return basis. However, over the past decade BIL is flat, while SPY soared 165% during an epic bull run.</p>
      <p>“There’s much less ‘opportunity cost’ than what we’re used to because it’s a place where you can get paid while you wait, but there’s not long-term price potential like in equities,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “So for people with more than a five-year time horizon, you still need equities in the portfolio to set you up for compounding returns.”</p>
      <p>The notion that yields may be peaking also has investors preaching caution when it comes to bonds. While bets have been building in recent weeks that the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates past 5% to stamp out inflation — boosting yields across the Treasury curve — traders are pricing in an end to increases by September.</p>
      <p>Tipp hearkened back to the 1970s, when inflation was a threat to both stocks and bonds. As growth moderated and rates leveled off and then came down, equities rose — even though the economy remained weak.</p>
      <p>“There’s a good chance that that kind of cyclicality is going to make its way through the markets, and people that lock in at the short term, exit the long-term markets and go into short term are going to suffer,” he said. “Their long-term returns are not going to be as high because the cash rates will probably move lower.”</p>
      <p>Analysts say that the haven appeal of cash-like positions combined with reliable returns means investors have an attractive place to wait out any turbulence induced by the Fed’s path.</p>
      <p>“I do think that we need to take advantage of the higher yields on the short-end of the yield curve, wait out this continued volatility,” David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview. “And then at some point we’ll hit a bottom, and that will be a great time to re-risk, take that money out of cash, put it back in equities and you’ll benefit from that.”</p>
      <p>Six-month Treasury bills currently yield about 5.1%, the highest since 2007, compared to the S&P 500’s earnings yield of roughly 5.3%. That’s the slimmest advantage for stocks since 2001.</p>
      <p>Though bonds look attractive at current yields relative to equities, the risk investors are taking in allocating to cash is the uncertainty of that yield going forward, said Josh Emanuel, chief investment officer at Wilshire, which oversees roughly $90 billion.</p>
      <p>“So, cash may pay you 4.5-5% today, but in one year that may not be the case, in two years that may not be the case,” he said in an interview. “The challenge in allocating to cash is that while you’re not taking any duration risk and you’re not taking any credit risk, the risk that you’re taking is the opportunity cost or the uncertainty risk associated with what that cash will pay you in the future relative to the yield you can lock in over the longer-term by moving out further on the yield curve.”</p>

      <p>Cryptocurrency markets are tumbling as the industry's once go-to bank faces a slew of financial woes, potentially threatening global crypto liquidity.</p>
      <p>The price of bitcoin hit a two-week low early Friday and experienced its largest one-hour price drop since the blowup of bankrupt exchange FTX in November. The token is trading 4% lower at $$22,394, per Messari.</p>  
      <p>Other major tokens followed suit. Ethereum shed 3%, falling to $1,573.</p> 
      <p>The market moves come after several companies like Coinbase, Circle, Galaxy Digital, and Paxos cut ties with Silvergate, which is delaying its annual report due to greater losses, flagging doubts about the future of its business.</p>
      <p>Many large digital asset exchanges work with Silvergate for transactions between entities, and a dent in those relationships could impact industry liquidity.</p>
      <p>Silvergate was entangled in a number of ailing firms such as FTX, resulting in a massive decline in deposits at the bank amid broader crypto market contagion. Shares of Silvergate have dropped 95% in the past year.</p>
      <p>"Fears are growing that a crypto-focused bank failure could constitute a new hit to investors' confidence after the bankruptcies of major crypto players during the last few months," Wael Makarem, senior market strategist at investment broker Exness, told Insider. "As a result, the market could be exposed to new price corrections while investors could be concerned about a potential impact on other market players."</p>
      <p>Makarem added: "This incident could strongly dent the market's recent rebound as cryptocurrencies remain in a delicate position. Additionally, the dwindling number of companies operating in crypto could add to the concerns."</p>
      <p>Crypto's total market capitalization sits above $1 trillion, per Messari, roughly two-thirds below its record high in November of 2021. Investor sentiment in digital assets took a beating in the past year on a series of crypto company bankruptcies, along with a rise in borrowing costs from a hawkish Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>Sentiment may have deteriorated further in cryptocurrency markets as traders brace themselves for the Fed's next move to tamp down inflation, which remains above the central bank's target.</p>

      <h3>S&P 500 Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The S&P 500 initially dipped during the trading week to show signs of weakness, only to turn around and show signs of life again. We are back above the 4000 level, so that of course is a good sign, but at the end of the day, this is a market that looks as if it is trying to roll over. Keep in mind that we have just gone through a significant portion of earnings, and it’s been a mixed bag to say the least.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the week, then it is likely that we could go down to the 3800 level, an area that previously had been rather supportive. By bouncing from there, it puts an imprint of support in that region that I think a lot of people will be paying attention to. On the upside, we have the 4100 level, which was previous support, but even more importantly we have the 4200 level above that has caused quite a bit of selling pressure, almost like a brick wall. That’s an area where we continue to see a lot of noise, so it does make a target that a lot of people may look for, but breaking above there might be a completely different question.</p>
      <p>You can see that I had a channel drawn previously, and we did break out of it only to turn around and retest that area for potential support. Either way, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility, so longer term traders may struggle.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has initially rallied during the course of the trading week to break above the 1.20 level, reaching towards 1.21 level before pulling back. We ended up forming a bit of an inverted hammer, so therefore it’s going to be interesting to see how this plays out. The previous week formed the same candlestick, and the week before that was very similar. In other words, every time we rally it looks like the sellers are starting to come back in and push lower.</p>
      <p>It looks as if the area around the 1.19 level is going to continue to be support, so I do think it’s worth watching. Breaking down through that area then opens up a bigger drop from what I can see, which of course is what would coincide with the longer-term trend. We had bounced rather significantly to test the 50% Fibonacci level, and then even formed a bit of a double top in that area. By doing so, this is a market that I believe continues to be very noisy, but in the end will find plenty of sellers to come in and punish it.</p> 
      <p>If global risk appetite continues to struggle, I just don’t see how this market takes off to the upside. A breakdown below the 1.1850 level will open up a move down to the 1.15 level, followed by the 1.1250 level. That does not necessarily mean that it will be sudden or have a lot of momentum, but that certainly looks as if it would be the more likely of scenarios right now.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin plunged nearly 5% over Thursday night following a Wednesday late notice filed by major industry bank Silvergate Capital that expressed doubts about the future of its business.</p>
      <p>In line with Bitcoin, the total market capitalization for crypto assets fell 4.6% from $1.06 trillion to $1.02 trillion between 8:18 p.m. to 9:05 p.m. Thursday New York time.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin hasn’t plunged so fast and sharp since the price fell by 4% from $20,538 to $19,704 on the morning of November 8 as FTT, the token for crypto exchange FTX, faced massive withdrawals.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin BTC-USD is changing hands at $22,381, down 4.3% for the last 24 hours and 6.4% over the past week.</p>
      <p>"After today’s drop, the pullback is close to 10%, and bitcoin is on pace to close below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time in nearly two months," according to a Friday note from BeSpoke.</p>
      <p>Over the past two days, the crypto market is coming to grips with the potential failure of industry-serving bank, Silvergate.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately, Silvergate is not FTX. Silvergate is more of a fiat on/off-ramp for U.S. Dollars, rather than a key source of liquidity and volume for the entire crypto ecosystem,” said Michael Safai, a co-founder and partner of crypto proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital.</p>
      <p>The La Jolla, Calif., headquartered Silvergate said in a Wednesday late notice it would further delay its annual report due to greater losses than it showed in January preliminary results in addition to “certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company” and its "ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements," according to the filing.</p>
      <p>Through Thursday, major crypto exchanges and businesses quickly distanced themselves from Silvergate. The shares of the bank (SI) has fallen 62% from Thursday morning to Friday's open from $13.50 to $5.14.</p>
      <p>Further exacerbating Silvergate’s business challenges, Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, BitStamp, Crypto.com, Cboe Digital, GSR and Circle each issued statements saying they have cut ties with what was once considered a crucial banking partner for the sector.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle added, it is “in the process of unwinding certain services with them.”</p>
      <p>Separately, Binance US and Kraken would not comment on their exposure to Silvergate.</p>
      <p>“There is some dismay around the Silvergate news, but it's not clear it would trigger strong selling,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told Yahoo Finance Friday.</p>
      <p>Dexterity's Safal agreed: “It’s more a case of jaded traders digesting the news and not wanting to be left holding any potential ticking time bombs, but not understanding how this differs from the collapses of 2022."</p>
      <p>Safai also suggested the response may have come from Asian markets reacting to the exodus of firms from Silvergate.</p>
      <p>Over Thursday, March 2, $203 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated or $198 million net of short liquidations — the most in a single day in three weeks — according to crypto derivatives aggregator Coinglass.</p>
      <p>As Acheson noted in her Friday newsletter, given little change of the ETH to BTC ratio, bitcoin's sharp drop hit the second largest cryptocurrency ether "in equal measure." Ether is changing hands at $1,570 per coin, down less than 4% for the past day as of Friday morning 8:30 New York time.</p>
      <p>In a worst case scenario of Silvergate's failure, confidence could be shaken, causing some firms to yank capital from the market, Dexterity's Safai said.</p>
      <p>“That in itself could impact liquidity, but that wouldn’t have a ripple effect per se, nor would it last very long,” he added.</p>
      <p>More important for Acheson are the repercussions for banking access if a traditional bank were to “go under” due to its crypto activities.</p>
      <p>“That would give regulators strong ammunition that crypto risks could become 'systemic' and any financial instiution serving the crypto industry could come up against new barriers,” Acheson explained over a messaging app.</p>
      <p>"Uncertainty is currently high," she added.</p>

      <p>The expected launch of the Shanghai hard fork has been delayed from late March to the first two weeks of April, according to Ethereum developers at a meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Shanghai hard fork will be the first major upgrade since the “Merge” last September. A hard fork is a permanent split between a new blockchain and its latest version, often adding or fixing features of a network.</li>
        <li>The Shanghai fork will allow validators to withdraw their locked Ether for the first time since the staking feature went live in 2020. Over 17 million Ether (about US$26.7 billion) has since been staked.</li>
        <li>During the meeting, core developers agreed that the hard fork should occur at least two weeks after the “Goerli testnet launch,” which has been scheduled for March 14.</li>
        <li>The “Shanghai Capella” upgrade to Goerli, one of Ethereum’s popular testnets, will be the last chance for Ethereum clients and staking providers to ensure the Shanghai hard fork can go through smoothly when the final “mainnet” version launches.</li>
        <li>“So imagine Goerli happens on the 14th, everything goes well, and on the 16th, we agree to move forward with mainnet – I think the earliest that puts us is like the first week of April,” said Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko.</li>
        <li>Beiko noted in a Thursday Twitter thread that the Ethereum team did not explicitly agree to a mainnet date. Still, they will “probably” set a date during the next developers meeting slated for March 16, “assuming things go well on Goerli.”</li>

      <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>

      <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>
      <p>In a press release on Thursday, FTX shared the extent of the company's deficit as bankruptcy lawyers scramble to unravel a mess that led to billions of dollars' worth of customer funds getting lost.</p>
      <p>The bankrupt crypto exchange's new executives have so far identified $2.2 billion in assets in the company's wallets, of which only $694 million were in the most liquid currencies, like fiat, stablecoins, bitcoin, or ethereum.</p>
      <p>Lawyers have also identified $385 million of customer receivables, and substantial claims against Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, the company at the center of FTX's controversial collapse. FTX lent $9.3 billion to Alameda, they said.</p>
      <p>"It has taken a huge effort to get this far. The exchanges' assets were highly commingled, and their books and records are incomplete and, in many cases, totally absent," CEO John Ray wrote.</p>
      <p>"For these reasons, it is important to emphasize that this information is still preliminary and subject to change."</p>
      <p>FTX US also has a shortfall, with $191 million in assets versus $335 million of customer claims and $283 million of related party claims payable.</p>
      <p>In January, bankruptcy lawyers said they had recovered $5.5 billion in liquid assets from FTX.</p>
      <p>But lawyers still don't know the extent of losses to customer funds, which burned famous faces like Tom Brady and Kevin O'Leary. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has estimated that $8 billion of client money had been lost by the exchange.</p>
      <p>Its latest presentation suggested there is a $9.5 billion deficit across its most liquid assets, and a $733 million surplus in category B assets — those which are harder to retrieve — including through the FTX native coin FTT.</p>
      <p>It was reported in November that FTX could have one million creditors.</p>

      <p>By Mehnaz Yasmin</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - The reward for holding U.S. stocks over Treasury bonds has not been this unattractive since 2004, possibly setting the stage for the sought-after 60/40 portfolio diversification to make a comeback after one of its worst years on record.</p>
      <p>A 60/40 portfolio, which typically has 60% of its holdings in stocks and the remaining 40% in fixed income, counts on moves in the two asset classes to offset one another, with stocks strengthening amid economic optimism and bonds rising during turbulent times.</p>
      <p>The strategy took a backseat in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to rein in inflation. However, signals from the stock and bond markets this year are pointing to a return of the popular asset allocation strategy.</p>
      <p>At the end of February, the S&P 500 returned 5.41% in earnings yield, the reciprocal of price-to-earnings ratio, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond surged to 3.94%, according to data from Refinitiv. The 1.47 percentage-point difference is the lowest upside stocks have held over bonds in nearly two decades.</p>
      <p>Earnings yield here refers to the S&P 500 earnings per share estimate for the next 12 moths divided by the index price.</p>
      <p>Graphic:https://www.reuters.com/graphics/STOCK-SPREADS/CHART/byprlqxyepe/chart.png</p>
      <p>"The relative shine of equities is definitely dulled by rising yields across the Treasury curve," said Eric Leve, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management firm Bailard.</p>
      <p>With estimates for earnings in 2023 implying essentially no growth over 2022, rates above 5% on short-term bonds and 10-year yields on the verge of 4% represent credible alternatives to stocks, according to Leve.</p>
      <p>The thinning spread between returns from stocks and bonds is set to bring the 60/40 portfolio strategy back in favor.</p>
      <p>"This strategy does provide excellent hedging in current environment," said Glenn Yin, Head of Research and Analysis at AETOS Capital Group.</p>
      <p>The 60/40 portfolio has already had the best start to the year since 1991, according to Bank of America.</p>
      <p>The Fed's move to tighten monetary policy at the fastest pace in decades pumped up bond yields after nearly two years of near-zero interest rates.</p>
      <p>But a rise in yields poses headwinds for equities, especially growth stocks, and by extension, a large index like the S&P 500. Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among the tech heavyweights that make up nearly a fifth of the index and bore the brunt of a sell-off last year.</p>
      <p>"Equity yields will continue to struggle this year as both prices and earnings decline" amid an economic slowdown, said Lance Roberts, Chief Investment Strategist at RIA Advisors.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, "during a recession, yields will fall and Treasury bond prices will rise," said Roberts. He prefers bonds over stocks today, he added.</p>
      <p>Recent results and guidance from companies have bolstered the case for investors who believe the stock market's early-year rally is unlikely to last.</p>
      <p>As of Feb. 24, results from 465 of the S&P 500 companies showed fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have fallen 3.2% from the year-ago quarter while Wall Street's expectation for S&P earnings growth for 2023 fell to 1.7% from an expected 4.4% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Expectations for U.S. earnings to decline in the first two quarters if the year come amid weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results for 2022, which Credit Suisse estimates will be the worst earnings season outside of a recession in 24 years.</p>
      <p>Investors are hoping that in case of a severe recession, the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates. While the economic downturn would hit stock returns, drop in bond yields should provide some relief in such a scenario, according to analysts.</p>
      <p>"For me, the best risk-reward portfolio in this environment for now is long duration Treasury bonds, and deep value, dividend equities," Roberts said. Deep value refers to stocks that are trading at a huge discount to their intrinsic values.</p>
      <p>"When the recession arrives, and the Fed cuts rates to zero, I will sell my bond portfolio to lock in the capital appreciation, and buy distressed equities with high yields and companies with strong balance sheets and earnings growth," he added.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Crypto companies are cutting ties with Silvergate, once the go-to bank for digital currencies</li>
        <li>This comes after the crypto bank flagged doubts about its survival.</li>
        <li>Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial and other big names have ditched the lender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the biggest names in crypto have backed away from lender Silvergate Capital after the key digital-currency player warned it's having to evaluate its ability to survive.</p>
      <p>Coinbase, Paxos Trust, Circle Internet Financial and Galaxy Digital Holdings all said Thursday they plan to suspend banking with Silvergate, as did the Winklevoss twins' Gemini.</p>
      <p>Crypto.com and Cboe's digital arm are also stepping away, Bloomberg reported.</p>
      <p>The exodus of crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers and trading desks came after Silvergate flagged doubts about its future in business.</p>
      <p>It said it was delaying the filing of its annual report to regulators because it needs more time to look into how badly its finances have been hit by the events battering the crypto world.</p>
      <p>"The company is evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of its financial statements," the California-based firm said in an SEC filing Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Silvergate's stock price plunged to close 58% lower on Thursday, and was down 5.24% at $5.42 in premarket trading Friday. Shares have fallen almost 95% in the past 12 months, as more than a dozen of its crypto firm customers shut down, were fined or came under investigation.</p>
      <p>Silvergate used to be the go-to bank for the biggest names in crypto, operating a key payments network used for real-time transfers between the firms.</p>
      <p>But the lender has struggled in recent months thanks to its ties to embattled crypto players, and it is seen as having suffered during as prices of digital assets tumbled last year.</p>
      <p>It has been caught up in fallout from the implosion of now-bankrupt FTX, which was one of the lender's major clients. Its customers withdrew $8 billion in deposits late last year after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</p>
      <p>In addition, it had relationships with other bankrupt crypto firms, like centralized lenders Celsius and BlockFi, along with digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital. It has also has worked with crypto exchange Binance's US arm, which is reportedly under criminal investigation for money laundering and criminal sanctions violations.</p>
      <p>As fears swirled that Silvergate's troubles would spread through the crypto sector, companies stepped up to underline their positions.</p>
      <p>MicroStrategy said it doesn't have any financial relationship with Silvergate, other than a loan it needs to pay back to Silvergate by 2025.</p>
      <p>"For anyone wondering, the loan wouldn't accelerate b/c of SI insolvency or bankruptcy. Our BTC collateral isn't custodied w/ SI & we have no other financial relationship w/ SI,"  the business intelligence firm tweeted.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin Tether is not exposed to Silvergate either, its chief technology officer said in a tweet Thursday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts cut their rating on Silvergate stock to "underweight" from "neutral" and withdrew its $14 price target, CoinDesk reported. It also said broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded the bank's rating to "hold" from "buy" and slashed its price target to $9 from $25.</p>

      <p>Interest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst 0xAcid's dashboard on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.</p>
      <p>According to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.</p>
      <p>In June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.</p>
      <p>A crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.</p>
      <p>The record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.</p>
      <p>WBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.</p>
      <p>The Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.</p>
      <p>According to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.</p>
      <p>"Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX," Osmo tweeted early Friday.</p>
      <p>At press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20. The cryptocurrency has seen a 50% appreciation in its market value this year, per CoinDesk data.</p>

      <p>Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, sold 650 bitcoins out of 683 it mined in February.</p>
      <p>The company said it sold the bitcoin to help pay for operating expenses and for general corporate purposes, according to a statement. Marathon sold 1,500 bitcoins in January, which marked the first time it had unloaded any of its holdings.</p>
      <p>Even with the February sales, said company Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, Marathon increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 8,090 bitcoins as of Jan. 31, 2023, to 8,260, valued at $191.2 million as of Feb. 28.</p>
      <p>The move to sell brings Marathon's strategy in line with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year. Prior to January, Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even though the company in May 2022 indicated it could become a seller at some point.</p>
      <p>Turning to operations, Marathon said it had installed computing power of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) at the end of February, up from 11 EH/s a month earlier, and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023. The company ended the month with $219.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, according to the statement.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the miner cancelled its earnings report and said that it will need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and currently unaudited quarterly reports from 2022 after an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) flagged technical accounting matters. Riot Platforms on Thursday also said it will delay its 10-K filings with the SEC due to due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
      <p>Marathon's shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday, remaining higher by more than 80% in 2023. Bitcoin is down about 1% over the last 24 hours and higher by 42% year to date.</p>

      <p>CORRECTION (March 3, 12:13 UTC): Corrects story to state that Riot has already filed its 10-K report after asking for an extension.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) delayed the filing of its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
      <p>“After assessing the impact of this revised impairment assessment methodology, the Registrant determined that material errors in certain of its financial statements and reports resulted,” Riot wrote in its SEC filing on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Specifically, Riot said its previously issued financial statements for 2022, 2021 and 2020 “contained material errors and should not be relied upon.”</p>
      <p>For those reasons, Riot said it needed additional time to complete its 10-K and it has since done so and filed its report for 2022.</p>
      <p>Shares of Riot were down 2.4% in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, fellow miner Marathon Digital (MARA) said it would need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and unaudited quarter reports from 2022 following an inquiry from the SEC that questioned its method of calculating impairment on digital assets.</p>
      <p>Marathon had previously been scheduled to release its 2022 Q4 results after the close of trading on Tuesday, but now has postponed that.</p>

      <p>As firms add more and more blockchains to their strategic road maps, I grow more and more frustrated. Where, I keep wondering, do firms have the money to properly understand and implement such an enormous array of blockchains in their operations? At EY, it costs us about $500,000 to add a new chain to our Blockchain Analyzer platform and we spend between 10%-20% of that amount each year keeping up to date.</p>
      <p>While setting up network nodes may not be too difficult, understanding how networks operate and the mechanics of transfers and payments is another matter. When we add a network, we take a close look at the transaction processing model (how transactions are initiated, recorded, processed and reported); the cryptography that underpins those transactions; and the risks that might be associated with different steps in the process. When it comes to audits, we even identify control points where we can perform verification steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.</strong></p>
      <p>Nor are these networks static entities. Ethereum has two to four hard forks a year and other smart contract-enabled chains evolve at a similar rate. The result: Staying up to date on a large number of different blockchains is costly.</p>
      <p>Cost isn’t the only factor, either. Liquidity becomes an issue as well. Polling Automated Market Makers (AMM) for their sample prices by volumes of proposed swaps on different token pairs shows how quickly liquidity drops off once you leave the Ethereum blockchain. Even within public Ethereum, trading is highly concentrated among the top tokens. Tokens without liquidity are much more vulnerable to price manipulation.</p>
      <p>Insufficient liquidity in an inadequately regulated market is one of the main reasons the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). The last year has shown, time and again, that crypto asset prices are often manipulated. So these concerns are unlikely to go away and will increasingly deter firms for interacting with, or transacting upon, less-liquid ecosystems.</p>
      <p>As if it wasn’t complicated enough, just deciding which chains to add is a constantly changing mix. Over the last few years, there has been a constant stream of “Ethereum killer” chains taking up the #2 spot in the ecosystem. A good measure of “who’s on top” is the DeFiLlama scorecard showing Ethereum dominance of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFiLlama tracks nearly 140 different chains. At various times, Binance, Terra, Tron and Celo have been in second place, but none has ever represented more than about 20% of the total DeFi ecosystem value. Usually the second chain by volume is at 10% or less.</p>
      <p>Nor is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility a useful factor in de-risking a chain’s adoption. EVM compatibility means that (in theory) applications written for Ethereum’s virtual machine will run on any other chain making that claim. Theory doesn’t always match reality exactly, however. As a result, EVM compatibility may actually increase risk.</p>
      <p>EVM compatibility is not perfect and the implementation on each chain is slightly different. While this can definitely make it simpler to deploy new smart contracts on a different chain, they may behave differently in a fully “compatible” environment and the claim of compatibility may increase risk that people deploy without careful consideration. We often encounter novel errors when moving smart contracts from bitcoineum testnets to the mainnet. I don’t see cross-chain deployment being easier under any conditions.</p>
      <p>All of this aligns with our own experience, which has shown that the amount of work required to qualify a new asset or service for our audit tools on Ethereum is significantly lower than other chains. That’s because we already have a strong understanding of the underlying ecosystem. Ethereum also offers far more liquidity than any other chain, all of it inside the same ecosystem with no cross-chain bridge risk.</p>
      <p>One way to anticipate how a much more regulated future looks is to examine how the biggest centralized or traditional finance firms are looking at the market for crypto assets. These firms are highly regulated and need to document their processes and work extensively to demonstrate they are not mishandling their client responsibilities. What you will see, over and over again, is that many of the biggest regulated firms have largely limited their offerings to BTC and ether (ETH) and have been very slow to grow that footprint. </p>
      <p>When the most regulated firms do start adding to the mix, my own prediction is they will begin by adding more tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem and, perhaps, adding curated sets of DeFi services from Ethereum as well. I had, in the past, expected that we would have seen this expansion during 2022. But the market turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny in the second half of last year caused many firms to move more slowly and increase their focus on compliance.</p>
      <p>All of these challenges were much easier to ignore when every chain was growing, venture-capital funding was plentiful and regulatory scrutiny was light. All those sunny conditions are gone now and the game is different. Between slashing burn rates and regulatory scrutiny, the multichain era is drawing to a close.</p>

      <p>US stocks rallied Thursday as a Federal Reserve official's comments on coming interest rates hikes cheered investors.</p>
      <p>After opening in mixed territory, the major indexes closed in the green, even as the 2-year note yield reached levels not seen in over a decade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped more than 300 points to lead the gains, supported by Salesforce's strong earnings.</p>
      <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he's "very firmly" in favor of a quarter-point hike for now, adding that it's important for the central bank to move cautiously.</p>
      <p>That comes after other Fed officials have hinted at the possibility of a half-point increase as recent data have pointed to a resilient economy that needs more slowing to get inflation under control.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, jobless claims fell for a third straight week, remaining below 200,000, in a sign the labor market is still strong.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are moving in Friday's intraday trading.</p>
      <p><strong>Video Transcript</strong></p>
      <p>[AUDIO LOGO]</p>
      <p>- Yeah. And taking a look at the market reaction here this morning too. You do see a little bit of just before the start of that 10:00 AM hour, it's moved lower off of, though, some of the intraday highs that we had seen early in today's trading activity on the Dow Jones Industrial average. Still holding onto gains of about a quarter of a percent in the green.</p>
      <p>The NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that also in positive territory. Up triple digits on a point basis. Percentage basis, it's up by about 1%. We'll round that off too. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 7/10 of a percent right now. Still holding on to those gains.</p>
      <p>And additionally, checking in on the major sectors here. The S&P 500 11. Taking a look at those sectors, and XLB is leading the pack, at least on that previous time scale that was loaded up on the screen. XLRE here on the day, on this Fri-yay, it's higher by about 1.25%. But you've got XLP. Yeah, indeed. Consumer staples not looking so hot, hot, hot. Down by about 7/10 of a percent here this morning, and we'll continue to watch that as we move on throughout the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>Overall though, you've got more gainers than laggards here, and we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. Taking a look at some of the Dow components as well. Apple is really leading the charge today. You're seeing that higher by about 2.5%. We've got much more on that this hour as well. And taking a look at the NASDAQ, you've also got a pretty mixed picture here. We'll kind of put this on a broader heat map view. It looks like more gainers than laggards. Just a rough look at things here on the day.</p>

      <p>Layer 1 blockchain network Near Protocol has launched a product-first operating system that developers can build into and users can interact on as a single platform, Illia Polosukhin, Near’s co-founder, announced at the ETHDenver industry conference.</p>
      <p>The platform is intended to act as a common layer for browsing and discovering Web 3 products including crypto exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) galleries and social networks, according to Polosukhin. The framework will be compatible with all blockchains (currently supporting Near Protocol and Ethereum Virtual Machine chains) and Near will act as the common entry point, said Polusukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>
      <p><strong>Read more: What Is Near Protocol and How Does It Work?</strong></p>
      <p>For developers, decentralized and composable front ends offer a way to build and launch better apps and faster forking of existing pieces and components, while leveraging built-ins such as profiles, payments and notifications as well as searching, without the need to host anything themselves, according to the press release.</p>
      <p>“The composable decentralized front ends as a framework can work with any Web2 or Web3 back end and any wallet,” Polusukhin said. “In the future we will be offering [use of] wallets from one chain to interact with another via seamless bridging,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Near protocol currently ranks as the 35th largest blockchain in terms of market capitalization, according to data from Messari. The layer 1’s market cap was around $1.96 billion and its NEAR token was trading at around $2.28, at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>The platform is dubbed a “blockchain operating system (BOS),” according to the press release. “We are moving away from our layer 1 focus, it’s now about the user and the experience they have. We are looking at this as the frontend for blockchains in general,” said Polosukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>
      <p>Polosukhin added the platform is hoping to tackle some of the user experience issues in the Web3 space. “As a user at the moment it’s hard to find a single place to look at Web3 apps, there’s no search mechanism or way to navigate between them,” said Polosukhin. “The BOS creates a single point of entry. ”</p>

      <p>By Samuel Indyk and Rae Wee</p>
      <p>LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped and China's yuan gained on Wednesday after China's manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace since April 2012, while the euro rose after regional German inflation data signalled price pressures remain high.</p>
      <p>The Australian and New Zealand dollars were also among the beneficiaries of the robust Chinese data, which smashed expectations with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) shooting up to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January.</p>
      <p>China's non-manufacturing activity also grew at a faster pace in February, while the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI reading for last month likewise surpassed market expectations.</p>
      <p>The onshore yuan finished the domestic session at 6.8854 per dollar, the strongest close since Feb. 21, while the offshore yuan jumped 1.3% to 6.8683 per dollar, set for its largest one-day gain since late November.</p>
      <p>"The data confirms expectations that the growth outlook has improved quite significantly in China, so it's positive for risk sentiment," said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.</p>
      <p>"This has put the dollar on the defensive."</p>
      <p>The kiwi surged 1.3% to $0.6263, while the Aussie gained 0.7% to $0.6774, reversing the slide to a two-month low earlier on Wednesday following soft domestic economic data.</p>
      <p>The antipodean currencies are often used as liquid proxies for the yuan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, inflation data from five German states was largely unchanged in the high single digits in February, pointing to no let-up in stubborn price pressures at the national level.</p>
      <p>Preliminary pan-German inflation data is to be published at 1300 GMT, calculated using data from up to 16 German states.</p>
      <p>Figures released on Tuesday showed accelerating inflation in France and Spain, two of the euro zone's biggest economies, pushing up expectations for rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
      <p>The euro was last up 0.9% against the dollar to $1.0672 , on track for its biggest daily gain since Feb. 1.</p>
      <p>"The euro is being well supported by the inflation data," Nordea's Christensen said.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for a more solid euro area inflation reading tomorrow than we had expected going into this week."</p>
      <p>Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.2049, although trimmed earlier gains after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said it was possible the central bank had already come to the end of its rate-rising cycle.</p>
      <p>The pound surged 1% at the start of the week after Britain struck a post-Brexit Northern Ireland trade deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar index fell 0.7% to 104.25.</p>
      <p>The index rose nearly 3% in February, its first monthly gain after a four-month losing streak, as a slew of strong U.S. economic data in recent weeks raised market expectations that the Federal Reserve has further to go in hiking rates.</p>
      <p>Futures pricing currently suggests a peak of around 5.4% in the Fed funds rate by September.</p>
      <p>"We see the Fed going to 5.5%, with a growing risk of 6%," said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank. "The Fed is hiking. Others can't follow or match. The dollar will soar."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.65% against the Japanese yen to 135.36, having spiked close to 5% against the yen in February, its largest monthly gain since last June.</p>

      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>

      <p>Alibaba BABA –0.22%  and other Chinese stocks were rallying on Wednesday after data showed that China is quickly leaving behind the lingering impacts of Covid-19 lockdowns, which spurred a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy last year.</p>
      <p>A key measure of Chinese growth marked its fastest expansion in more than a decade in February, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) rising to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January. The February PMI came ahead of expectations and also marked the highest level since April 2021.</p>
      <p>The PMI data is “the strongest sign yet that demand and supply are being fully restored following the lifting of all Covid restrictions in December,” said Raffi Boyadjian, an analyst at broker XM. “The initial tepid pickup in the economy had raised some concerns about how long it would take for the full effects of the reopening to transpire so it’s very encouraging for investors to see that the recovery is well under way.”</p>

        <p>TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were higher Wednesday after reports on key measures of China manufacturing showed a strong recovery after anti-virus controls were lifted late last year.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 3.3% and Shanghai gained 0.9%.</p>
        <p>Purchasing managers’ indexes issued by a business magazine, Caixin, and the official China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing showed gains in production, exports and new orders.</p>
        <p>Business activity is recovering after the ruling Communist Party ended stringent anti-virus restrictions in early December. That followed a slump in activity that dragged last year’s economic growth to 3%, its second-lowest level since at least the 1970s.</p>
        <p>That was good news in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng gained more than 700 points to 20,486.79.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's own outlook has improved as it also has relaxed pandemic precautions. The territory's chief executive, John Lee, announced Tuesday t hat masks will no longer be required both outdoors and indoors, but some high-risk areas including hospitals and elderly homes can still require their use.</p>
        <p>The Shanghai Composite added 28 points to 3,308.53. South Korean markets were closed for a national holiday.</p>
        <p>Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 picked up 0.3% to 27,523.17. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.1% to 7,263.10.</p>
        <p>Wall Street closed out a frigid February with more losses on Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, locking in a loss of 2.6% for the month and closing at 3,970.15. The Dow fell 0.7% to 32,656.70 while the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower to 11,455.54. Both also sank over the month.</p>
        <p>Investors are keeping an eye on the last of the earnings reports for this season. Several big-name retailers are still on the schedule for this week.</p>
        <p>“The consumer and inflation are in focus over the next few days. After last week’s drubbing among retail stocks, the worst since June last year, some upbeat earnings results from Target should buoy the group,” said Brian Overby, senior market strategist at Ally, while warning that more volatility may be in store later this week.</p>
        <p>After a strong start to the year driven by hopes inflation is abating, Wall Street shifted into reverse in February. A stream of data showed inflation and the overall economy are remaining more resilient than expected. That’s forced investors to raise their forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there.</p>
        <p>High rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession down the line because they hurt the economy. They also drag on prices for stocks and other investments. </p>
        <p>Heightened expectations for rates sent yields jumping in the bond market Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.92%. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that shape the economy’s health, and still near its highest level since November. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, ticked up to 4.81% from 4.78%. It’s near its highest level since 2007.</p>
        <p>Reports on the economy released Tuesday showed some slight cracks. One said that confidence among U.S. consumers fell in February. Another said that manufacturing in the Chicago region weakened by more than expected.</p>
        <p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 48 cents to $77.53 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, rose $0.52 to $83.97 a barrel.</p>
        <p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to $136.37 Japanese yen from $136.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.0596 from $1.0583.</p>

        <p>U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday, with the S&P 500 finishing February with the worst monthly performance since December amid heightened worries over sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA closed 0.7% lower Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX fell 0.3% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP edged down 0.1%, according to preliminary data from FactSet. For the month, the Dow shed 4.2%, while the S&P 500 slid 2.6% and the Nasdaq slipped 1.1%, preliminary FactSet data show. Stocks sold off in February after bond-market concerns over stubbornly high inflation sparked a rise in Treasury yields.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see the Japanese yen pay the price for the Bank of Japan monetary policy. As the 10 year JGB presses 50 basis points, the Bank of Japan has to step in and start printing yen in order to buy bonds. Quite frankly, at this point Japan has no other option but to accept either a weakening currency, or higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>With interest rates around the world climbing overall, it does make a lot of sense the Japanese yen will continue to get hammered as more pressure will be put on the bond market in Tokyo. As the Bank of Japan is the only major central bank in the world offering quantitative easing, the Japanese yen is an easy target for currency traders. With that being the case, not only will the US dollar continue to climb against the Japanese in but is very likely that we will see multiple other currencies do the same. In fact, when you look at the British pound, it is completely ripping the face off of the Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>Just above, the ¥137.50 level is an area that we will need to pay close attention to due to the fact that it was a previous resistance barrier, right along with support. There should be a certain amount of “market memory” in that area, and therefore it’s going to take a significant amount of momentum to break through that area. Short-term pullbacks are very likely, but those will more likely than not end up being buying opportunities.</p>
      <p>The ¥135 level underneath should be support, due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and it is also an area that we have seen quite a bit of noise there in both directions. The 200-Day EMA sits near the ¥134 level, and the 50-Day EMA is getting ready to cross above there in order to form the “golden cross” indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to for a longer-term “buy-and-hold” type of attitude. I have no interest in shorting this pair anytime soon, at least not until the interest rate situation around the world calms down.</p>

      <p>The British pound has skyrocketed against the Japanese yet again during the trading session on Tuesday as we have seen massive amounts of downward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen across the board.

      <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has skyrocketed against the Japanese yet again during the trading session on Tuesday as we have seen massive amounts of downward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen across the board. With that being the case, I think this is a market that is now starting to reach a little bit of noise, so perhaps the question now is whether or not we should be switching from the British pound to other currencies against the yen?</p>
      <p>As an example, the New Zealand dollar looks like it’s getting close to breaking out against the Japanese Yen, and while I do believe that the British pound can continue to climb from here, it’s got a lot more noise in the short term to deal with and it has had in the last 48 hours. I certainly wouldn’t short this pair, but I recognize that it has outstretched itself a little bit during the day. With that in mind, I would be cautious, but I would look at pullbacks as a potential buying opportunity.</p>
      <p>Quite frankly, what I would like to see is this market continue to rip higher, because there’s more value to be found in other yen related crosses. For example, the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar all look like they are ready to rip higher against the Japanese yen as well. Simply put, I believe that this chart might be a proxy for what the yen is doing at the moment, because if an overbought condition like this can continue to find buyers, clearly other pairs will have to pay homage to this, and play catch up.</p>

      <p>The Euro has initially pulled back during the trading session on Tuesday but found enough support underneath the 1.06 level to turn things around and show signs of life.

The 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.0675 level, and therefore it looks as if it is going to be a bit of resistance.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has initially pulled back during the trading session on Tuesday but found enough support underneath the 1.06 level to turn things around and show signs of life. The overall market structure of the day seems to be a bit positive, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see the Euro trying to pick up a bit of momentum. The 50-Day EMA sits just below the 1.0675 level, and therefore it looks as if it is going to be a bit of resistance.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you need to keep an eye on the fact that we are between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, because they attract a lot of attention. Typically, when a currency pair is sitting between these 2 indicators, it means that there are probably going to be traders in both directions pushing quite hard. Typically, when you find the market in this range, there is an explosive move sooner or later as one side or the other finally loses.</p>
      <p>If we break above the 50-Day EMA, it’s possible that the market goes looking to the 1.08 level. On the other hand, if we break down below the 200-Day EMA, is very likely that we would see a huge move lower. On a break down below the 200-Day EMA, I suspect that we will eventually go down to the 1.03 level, and then eventually the parity level which of course would be an area that would attract a lot of attention. Keep an eye on the interest rate situation in the United States, because recently the 2 year and the 10 year have seen moves higher in yield.</p>
      <p>That does typically help the US dollar, but ultimately this is a situation where the markets are in flux, and therefore a lot of noisy behavior does make significant sense. The European Central Bank has reiterated its mission to keep inflation down to 2%, but at the same time the Federal Reserve has reiterated its attitude of staying tight for longer. Because of this, a lot of choppiness is more likely than not going to be the case going forward, so therefore position sizing will be crucial.</p>

      <p>Ethereum’s fee market is slowly returning to form amid a recent resurgence in NFT trading activity across the network.</p>
      <p>According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the median price for gas powering Ethereum transactions cost roughly 10 to 20 gwei over the past 9 months. This month, that cost had risen to 38 gwei—higher than during key bear market events including FTX’s collapse in November (36 gwei) and Binance’s “bank run” in December (24 gwei).</p>
      <p>“The incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway,” wrote Glassnode in its weekly newsletter on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gas prices fluctuate with network demand, meaning costs rise as more users seek to include their transactions in the next Ethereum block. In this case, rising activity in Ethereum’s NFT market appears to be a primary source of the newfound demand for gas.</p>
      <p>You Can Thank NFTs for Falling Ethereum Gas Prices</p>
      <p>Specifically, gas used by Ethereum NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two months straight, approaching levels last seen during the “NFT boom” from mid-2021 to mid-2022. Much of that rising activity is thanks to Blur, an NFT marketplace launched in October that’s now overtaken OpenSea in terms of trading volume.</p>
      <p>“The recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559,” explained Glassnode.</p>
      <p>Other drivers of NFT activity include all-new projects launched by the industry’s biggest names, including Yuga Labs’ Dookey Dash game and the announcement of Doodles 2 last month.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Ethereum network adoption rate remains low. The number of new addresses being generated is still 40% below what it was 12 months ago. This suggests that the recent revival in NFT activity has been spurred among existing NFT users, rather than new ones.</p>
      <p>Not all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem are seeing rising revenues. In an interview with Decrypt on Friday, Doodle CEO Julian Holguin said that the competition between OpenSea and Blur is constricting cash available to many NFT projects that relied on secondary royalties for revenue.</p>

        <p>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks edged lower on Tuesday, on track for their biggest February percentage decline in over two decades, as geopolitical risks and fears about U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer cooled demand for riskier assets.</p>
        <p>The MSCI EM equities index slipped 0.5% and was down 6.6% this month, headed for its worst February performance since 2001. A rally in EM stocks at the beginning of 2023 has petered out in recent weeks after signs of strength in the U.S economy fueled fears of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical risks including heightened U.S.-China tensions also weighed on sentiment.</p>
        <p>"It's started to get more challenging for emerging markets," said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</p>
        <p>"We think weakness in the global economy will lead to more risk-off in the next few quarters, providing a difficult backdrop."</p>
        <p>Data on Tuesday showed China's urban employment fell for the first time in six decades last year and per capita spending also marked a rare decline, as harsh COVID-19 curbs ravaged the world's second-biggest economy.</p>
        <p>Stocks in China rose 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 0.8%.</p>
        <p>Regional currencies were muted against a stronger dollar and are set to record their worst month since September 2022.</p>
        <p>The South African rand was down 0.2% ahead of the release of domestic money supply, budget, trade and unemployment data later in the day.</p>
        <p>Russia's rouble was stronger against the U.S. dollar at 74.39. Local media reported that Russia's oil output was back at pre-sactions levels for the first time in February.</p>
        <p>Turkey's lira was flat at 18.8860 after data showed the country's economy expanded 5.6% in 2022, more than expected with growth slowing to 3.5% in the fourth quarter as a decline in demand continued.</p>
        <p>In central and eastern Europe, Hungary's forint edged lower against the euro ahead of an interest rate decision by the country's central bank due later in the day.</p>
        <p>The National Bank of Hungary is widely expected to keep its base rate steady at 13%.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in emerging markets, India's GDP growth likely slowed further in the October-December quarter amid weakening demand and is set to lose more momentum as a series of interest rate hikes weigh on activity, according to a Reuters poll.</p>

        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Tuesday as investors reassess the global economy's outlook given expectations for higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 FTSE dropped 0.74% to 7,876.28 points at close of trading on Tuesday, while the CAC 40 FCHI in Paris was muted at 7,291 points. In Germany, the DAX GDAXI was also flat at 15,383.</p>
        <p>Across the pond, US stocks fell Tuesday at the open, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.34% to 32,775 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.31% to 3,980 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) edged lower by 0.21% to 11,472.</p>
        <p>Traders are increasingly worried that central banks around the globe will remain hawkish in order to bring down persistent inflation.</p>
        <p>“Rishi Sunak’s new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland breathed some life back into the pound yesterday, yet the currency gave back some of these gains on Tuesday as markets took time to digest the information," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p>
        <p>"While the deal may provide a reset for UK/EU relations and be good for the UK economy, reports suggest some in the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] are not fully satisfied by what’s on the table.”</p>
        <p>Inflation figures in Spain and France both rose in February while the latest grocery price survey from Kantar in the UK showed food price inflation hit a record high, up 17.1%.</p>

        <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado (OCDO.L) dropped by 7.81%, the top faller on the FTSE 100 index.</p>
        <p>The online supermarket saw its pre-tax loss balloon to nearly £501m last year, nearly three times as high as in 2021.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 slipped 0.4% to 7,902, pulled down by poorly received results from Ocado and Croda (CRDA.L), and housebuilders falling in response to Travis Perkins’ cautious outlook in its latest figures.</p>
        <p>The builders’ merchant said it was preparing for ‘more challenged’ private domestic new-build and repair, maintenance and improvement markets.</p>
        <p>Moving in the opposite direction, online electricals retailer AO World (AO.L) was up by 23.38% as it boosted it annual earnings outlook for the third time since November as it said cost-cutting efforts and targeted price rises were paying off.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) rose and was trading at around $83/barrel as demand surged ahead of the release of fresh economic data from China, the world’s largest oil importer and second largest consumer.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 N225 rose 0.1% to 27,445 points, while the Hang Seng HSI in Hong Kong slipped 0.78% to 19,044. The Shanghai Composite edged higher, rising 0.66% to 3,279 points.</p>

      <p>Allianz Investment Management Head ETF Market Strategist Johan Grahn sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss volatility and market performances amid inflation and the Fed's interest rate hike cycle.</p>
      <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: All right, welcome back to "Yahoo Finance Live." We're going to check on the markets with just a bit before trading closes. Let's see, the Dow falling now 222 points, and check out the S&P and the NASDAQ hovering around the level point. Down just a bit on the S&P, and the NASDAQ just barely in the positive.</p>
      <p>What is ahead for this economy and equities? Let's talk about all of it with Johan Grahn, Allianz Investment Management head ETF market strategist. Nice to see you, sir. Seems like the markets, relatively speaking, holding their breath. What could be the next catalyst around the corner?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, Dave, it's good to see you. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Catalysts? There could be all kinds of catalysts around the corner for you just lurking in the background here. The one thing that we've seen is that we have an environment of increased volatility. And even if it's been coming down a little bit this past week, we're still in a pretty high-volatility environment by historical standards, so to speak.</p>
      <p>So basically it tells you that all the known factors are baked in and that the known factors are bound to swing one way or another, or something new will pop up at any point in time. So it's a good question with a very weak answer for you because it could be a myriad of things.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Well, Johan, when you take into account what's happening today, where we are at current levels here, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how exactly to play this market given all of that uncertainty that you were just talking about. So what's your advice to those who are trying to decide what now is-- I guess what is best to do right now?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Yeah, it really depends on what kind of time you have. And I mean, frankly, most of the assets are sitting in retirement accounts, as you know. So it's really those investors and Americans that have the least amount of time left in their investing careers, so to speak.</p>
      <p>And what it leads to is a fight against this wealth destruction that the Fed has set out to navigate for us, if you will. And what it comes down to is that you have to be more conservative. You've got to think about how you can keep that wealth as opposed to rallying for the highest potential return.</p>
      <p>And there are various ways you can do it, and I think one of the benefits of the current environment, even though it's a silver lining given the volatility that we're in, is that when you look at this market with higher equity volatility and also higher fixed-income volatility, higher rates, it gives you an opportunity to invest in structured products where you can actually set the definition of what you're looking for, and it gives you more upside given the unit of risk that you're mitigating on the downside in an environment like this.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Johan, many just feel that the 10 year is really in control and closing their eyes to the equities right now to the highest we've seen since November, 50-plus basis points this month alone. What does it tell you is around the corner?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, the proverbial Fed tactics are always around the corner, as you know. And we're still looking at this environment where you have the Fed consistently telling the market that you are going to have to be more patient and the market reacting and responding consecutively to all this communication. And it's happened over and over and over again. Every time the Fed comes out to have this conversation, the market will try to call the bluff, and then they have to move aside and say, OK, fine. We'll adjust accordingly, and it keeps happening.</p>
      <p>And I think that right now we might be very much closer to the point where the market is, frankly, catching up to what the Fed has been saying all along, and now we're talking about the duration of how long the Fed is going to keep the rates high and how many more hikes they're going to pursue to get there.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: And you see no pivot until '24, presumably?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: No pivot until '24. The market is still-- there is a little bit of a delta between what the market is pricing in and what the Fed is speaking to the market. But in terms of a real pivot, nothing until 2024 for sure.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether traded little-changed on Tuesday morning in Asia, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell. Polygon led the losers, along with Solana and Shiba Inu. U.S. equities gained ground on Monday after last week’s slump.</p>
      <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin dipped 0.23% in the past 24 hours to trade little changed at US$23,509 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The leading token is holding a seven day loss of 5.34%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum also treaded water at US$1,634, off 0.41%. The token is down 4.05% in the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Polygon’s Matic token posed the biggest drop among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, falling 3.63% to US$1.24, and extending its weekly loss to 16.27%. Polygon Labs, the developer of the Polygon blockchain, said last week it would lay off 20% of its workforce, which was followed by a reported glitch on Polygon’s network.</li>
        <li>Solana lost 2.43% to US$22.69, posting a weekly loss of 13.41%. Solana developers are investigating a network failure on the Solana Mainet Beta last Saturday, which forced it to restart the network and downgrade it from a recent update.</li>
        <li>Shiba Inu dropped 2.53% after analytics firm Lookonchain reported a wallet moving 182 billion Shiba Inu tokens to crypto exchanges on Monday, usually the sign of preparation for selling that can drive prices lower. Last time the same wallet transferred over 200 billion Shiba Inu in December 2022 the price fell more than 7% on the day, according to Lookonchain. The token is down 7.21% for the seven day period.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization edged 0.15% lower to US$1.07 trillion, while the total trading volume jumped 34.55% over the past 24 hours to US$45.70 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities edged higher on Monday after last week’s tumble on concerns about indicators showing inflation remains entrenched. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.22%, the S&P 500 gained 0.31% and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.63%.</li>
        <li>Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, told CNN on Monday that U.S. inflation remains too high, but the economy can achieve a soft landing. She said the Federal Reserve’s attempt to curb inflation through higher interest rates while maintaining a strong labor market appears achievable.</li>
        <li>U.S. interest rates are now between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. The January Federal Reserve meeting minutes released last Wednesday showed policymakers agreed to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes, but warned the tightening cycle is not over.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Census Bureau announced its latest monthly report on durable goods on Monday, with orders for manufactured goods – excluding transportation – rising 0.7% in January, or below expectations in a sign of a slowdown in the growth that has been feeding inflation.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict a 76.7% likelihood the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points in March. They also predict a 23.3% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 27.7% as reported on Monday.</li>

      <p>The US dollar has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously. Because of this, it looks as if the market is going to try to go to the ¥137.50 level, an area that previously had been significant resistance. If we can break above there, then it’s possible that the market could go to the ¥140 level.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously. Because of this, it looks as if the market is going to try to go to the ¥137.50 level, an area that previously had been significant resistance. If we can break above there, then it’s possible that the market could go to the ¥140 level.</p>
      <p>If we pull back from here, the ¥135 level courses a large, round, psychologically significant figure, in an area that previously had been resistance. The fact that we broke above there should now have “market memory” attached to it, suggesting that there should be plenty of value hunters in that general vicinity. The Bank of Japan continues to keep interest rates low and fight 10 year yields from rising above 50 basis points.</p>
      <p>In order to do so they will have to continue to print yen in order to buy their own bonds in Japan. In other words, if rates start to rise again, that will only help the US dollar clobber the Japanese yen. You can also see that the Japanese yen is getting the same treatment almost everywhere, so this is most certainly a Japanese Yen situation more than it is a US dollar situation.</p>
      <p>Looking at this chart, I do think that the trend is starting to change, so I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we try to reach towards the top again as the Bank of Japan has dug in its heels when it comes to yield curve control and has reiterated multiple times that it was going to be stuck in it. At the same time, we have the Federal Reserve making it abundantly clear that it is going to stay “tighter for longer”, meaning that monetary policy in the United States will be much more restrictive than many other economies around the world, thereby making the US dollar attractive.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea. The 1.21 level features the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which of course a lot of people pay close attention to. Because of this, the market is more likely than not going to continue to be very noisy but seems to have a short-term ceiling due to those indicators. Any rally at this point in time more likely than not should be sold into, on the first signs of exhaustion.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we break down below the hammer from last week, it’s very likely that we could go looking to the 1.18 level, an area that really looks supported a while back, and it’s also an area we had launched from to enter the consolidation area that we had been in for a while. If we break down below that level, then it’s like a trapdoor opening, allowing the British pound to fall quite drastically. It does make a certain amount of sense, due to the fact that the US dollar continues to strengthen across the board, so there’s really no reason to think that the British pound will be any different.</p>
      <p>Granted, the Bank of England has recently had to deal with a lot of inflation and therefore monetary policy may remain tight longer than anticipated, but at the same time you can certainly take that same attitude towards the Federal Reserve, and of course the Federal Reserve will get what it wants given enough time.</p>
      <p>It seems traders are just now starting to come to grips with the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to remain “tighter for longer”, as inflation simply is going nowhere in the United States. There’s a high demand for US dollars currently, as interest rates around the world continue to climb, and world governments have to pay back US dollar denominated debt. I like fading rallies at the first signs of exhaustion.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen a bit early during the trading session on Monday to touch the 200-Day EMA. The market bounced from that level to turn around and show signs of life, and now threatens the 1.06 level. It’ll be interesting to see whether or not this happens, due to the fact that there is so much downward pressure on the major currencies that are not the US dollar. The US dollar breaking higher due to the fact that people have struggled with risk appetite, and of course the fact that interest rates on the 2 year yield in America continue to climb, despite the fact that Wall Street believes that the Federal Reserve will eventually come and bail them out.</p>
      <p>The Euro of course has its own issues, not the least of which will be the fact that the economy is running into significant headwinds, but at the same time has a certain amount of inflation. Because of this, the Euro is not ready to go down without a fight but at the end of the day one of the main things that has this market somewhat levitated is the fact that Christine Lagarde has stated repeatedly that an inflation target of 2% is crucial. Nonetheless, if we continue to see a lot of negativity out there when it comes to risk appetite, the Euro will more likely than not start to sell off yet again.</p>
      <p>If we can break down below the 200-Day EMA, then the 1.05 level will be targeted. Anything below there then opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.04 level, and then possibly the 1.0250 level. After that, we have the possibility of going down to the parity level. The parity level of course will attract a lot of headlines, and therefore could be a noisy affair. The alternative scenario would be breaking above the 1.07 level, which would open up a potential move to the 1.08 level. That is where the massive selloff begins from a couple of weeks ago and therefore, I think that as long as we have the same fundamental situation, rallies are more likely than not going to be sold into.</p>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea.

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level. By doing so, it suggests that the Aussie is going to continue to see a lot of negativity, and that of course makes a certain amount of sense due to the fact that the global economy seems to be slowing down. Remember, the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to global growth, as the Australian economy is so highly leveraged not only mainland China, but also commodity trading in general. As long as there are concerns of a global slowdown, it does make a certain amount of sense that the Aussie will struggle. Furthermore, the 50-Day EMA is starting to roll over, and is getting ready to break down below the 200-Day EMA, a negative technical indicator known as a “death cross.”</p>
      <p>In the area of 0.67, there is a significant amount of support. Because of this, short-term bounce would not be huge price, but that should more likely than not have a lot of people jumping into the market to short the Aussie again, in order to pick up “cheap US dollars.” If we break down below all the noise just below the 0.67 level, then it’s likely that the market would go looking to the 0.6450 level given enough time.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we were to turn around and breakout above the moving averages above, then the market could go looking to the 0.70 level. The 0.70 level is obviously a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we’ve seen a lot of selling recently. Nonetheless, I do think that this pullback is rather significant, and could get the market really selling off if we get more “risk off behavior” around the world. Regardless of what happens next, we are at an inflection point, and therefore it’s likely that we will see a lot of choppy and noisy trading in this general vicinity.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>Tokens of Shiba Inu-themed Floki can soon be used as collateral to borrow a basket of cryptocurrencies on Venus Protocol, the second-largest lending platform on the BNB Chain, Floki developers told CoinDesk on Friday.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a broader plan to make FLOKI, which was originally a meme coin named after billionaire Elon Musk's pet dog, as a serious decentralized-finance token.</p>
      <p>Venus provides a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing product that allows users to directly borrow against collateral at a high speed while losing less to transaction fees. It held over $800 million in locked tokens as of Friday.</p>
      <p>Venus will be integrating FLOKI in its money-market platform, thereby allowing FLOKI holders on the BNB Chain to borrow USDT, USDC, BNB and a basket of other cryptocurrencies while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
      <p>This allows FLOKI token holders to easily access liquidity without having to sell their tokens.</p>
      <p>The move is expected to benefit FLOKI holders, developers say, as they continue to build and seek strategic partnerships that ultimately benefit the token’s value.</p>
      <p>The FLOKI integration process on Venus has started, and is expected to be completed in March. After that, FLOKI holders will be able to seamlessly lend and borrow on Venus while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
      <p>FLOKI has so far been one of the strongest crypto performers this year, tripling in value over a 30-day rolling period, according to CoinGecko. Interest in the tokens has heightened in recent months following a $100 million token burn and a push to target Valhalla, Floki’s metaverse game, to the multibillion-dollar Chinese gaming market.</p>

      <p>A customer hands Indian currency notes to an attendant at a fuel station in Mumbai</p>
      <p>By Nimesh Vora</p>
      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee rose against the dollar on Thursday, helped by a broad recovery in Asian currencies following losses fuelled by worries over rising U.S. yields.</p>
      <p>The rupee was at 82.77 to the U.S. dollar by 10:29 a.m. IST, up from 82.85 in the previous session. Following the higher opening, the local currency has been in a three-paisa range.</p>
      <p>The rupee, it can be safely assumed, will stick to the 82.80 level through the session, a currency dealer at a private sector bank said. Volumes are likely to be on the lower side and speculative interest will be minimal, he said.</p>
      <p>The Korean won, the Asian currency worst impacted by the market's ongoing reassessment of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike path, lead the recovery against the dollar on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was up 0.8% while others rose 0.2% to 0.3%. The dollar index declined slightly.</p>
      <p>The Fed minutes released overnight noted that almost all participants preferred a 25 basis points (bps) hike at the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 Fed meeting, and a few would have liked a 50 bps hike.</p>
      <p>However, the minutes did not have a significant impact on Asian currencies, as they were considered "outdated". Since the Fed's February meeting, there has been a series of data points on inflation and economic activity that surprised the market.</p>
      <p>We’ve already been hearing from some Fed officials that they may be open to up the size of the rate hikes and that a higher terminal rate may be needed, Scotiabank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Risk appetite in Asia was better, weighing on demand for the dollar. Asian shares were mostly higher and futures indicated a positive opening for U.S. equities. Oil prices inched up, recovering from two-week lows.</p>

      <p>On-chain liquidity and derivatives trading protocol Synthetix has deployed version 3 (v3) on the Ethereum mainnet following security audits, developers said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Synthetix (SNX) is a protocol that enables the issuance of synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain – allowing users to mint, hold, and trade a wide range of derivatives – including commodities, fiat currencies, and even stocks.</p>
      <p>The protocol holds over $450 million in locked tokens over the Ethereum and Optimism blockchains as of Thursday. It held just shy of $3 billion in total locked value (TVL) at its February 2021 record high.</p>
      <p>Developers previously stated said that Synthetix v3 will have much more efficient architecture to allow developers to create faster, complex and more efficient decentralized financial (DeFi) applications.</p>
      <p>V3 will allow the creation of products that offer a liquid market for any financial derivative that developers want to build, from traditional financial markets to more exotic markets such as no-loss lotteries or even wholly separate protocols.</p>
      <p>V3 will also offer simplified staking and differentiated debt pools, allowing network stakers to supply collateral to, and receive fees from, specific asset pools without having to be exposed to every Spartan Council-supported asset.</p>
      <p>The Spartan Council (SC) is the central governing body of the Synthetix protocol that votes on overall improvement proposals and parameter changes.</p>
      <p>Synthetix’s native SNX tokens saw nominal price changes in the past 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Intel INTC reported Q4 results after market close yesterday. The world’s largest chipmaker missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers.</p>
      <p>As such, shares of INTC plunged about 10% in after-market hours. Given this, ETFs like First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK, and Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJD having the highest allocation to the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will be in focus.</p>
      <h3>Q4 Earnings in Focus</h3>
      <p>Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and the year-ago earnings of $1.09. Revenues declined 32% year over year to $14 billion and came in above the estimated $14.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Client computing, data-center and AI, and network and edge revenues declined 36%, 33% and 1%, respectively. However, accelerated computing systems and graphics, Intel Foundry Services and Mobileye revenues were up 1%, 30% and 59%, respectively (see: all the Technology ETFs here).</p>
      <p>The chipmaker continued to suffer from dismal PC and data-center markets. Shoppers choose to hold on to the laptops and desktops they purchased at the peak of the pandemic. According to Gartner, Q4 worldwide PC shipments declined 28.5%, the biggest decline since the firm started following shipments in the mid-1990s.</p>
      <p>As such, Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share. Both revenue and earnings per share guidance are well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion and 26 cents per share, respectively.</p>

      <p>While Intel INTC and Qualcomm QCOM disappointed investors, Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research Corporation LRCX and Advanced Micro Devices AMD came up with solid earnings reports. As such, semiconductor ETFs remained strong over the past month with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL rising 12.8%, 12.7%, 12.4%, 10.4% and 8.7%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Let’s dig into the individual performances:</p>
      <h3>Semiconductor Earnings in Focus</h3>
      <p>Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers. Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and revenues of $14 billion also came in below the estimated $14.5 billion. Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share (read: Intel Plunges on Earnings Miss, Weak Guidance: ETFs in Focus).</p>
      <p>Texas Instruments reported solid Q4 results topping our earnings estimate by 17 cents and revenue estimate by $84 million. For first-quarter 2023, the company expects revenues in the range of $4.17-$4.53 billion and earnings per share of $1.64-$1.90.</p>
      <p>Lam Research also topped on both revenue and earnings for second-quarter fiscal 2023. Earnings per share of $10.71 strongly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 76 cents, while revenues of $5.28 billion edged past the estimated $5.08 billion. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects revenues of $3.8 billion (+/- $300 million) and earnings per share of $6.50 (+/- 75 cents).</p>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings by three cents and on revenues by $58 million. It expects first-quarter 2023 revenues of $5.3 billion (+/-$300 million), which indicates a year-over-year decline of 10%.</p>
      <p>At Qualcomm, earnings per share of $2.37 for first-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents, while revenues of $9.46 billion fell short of the estimate of $9.56 billion. The company projects revenues of $8.7-$9.5 billion and earnings per share of $2.05-$2.25 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, as we have seen quite a bit of volatility. Again. The 50-Day EMA has been offering resistance, and of course the 200-Day EMA also is an area where we have seen the light of pressure as well. Now that we have pulled back a bit, it’s likely that we continue to see a lot of noise between here and the 1.20 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that a lot of people will be paying attention to. Furthermore, the 1.20 level is an area where we had seen quite a bit of support previously, so I think everything comes together quite nicely for that being a bit of the support barrier.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 1.20 level, then it’s likely that we go down to the 1.1850 level. The 1.1850 level course was a swing low, and I believe that will be the bottom of the uptrend. In other words, if we break down below there, it’s likely that we drop down to the 1.15 level as it should open up a bit of a vacuum. The shooting star from last week suggests that we have a lot of resistance just above near the 1.2250 level, so if we were to break above there it opens up the possibility of a double top, which is at the 1.24 level, with resistance extending all the way to the 1.25 level. Now that we have formed a double top in that area, one would have to believe that it is going to continue to be a very important level.</p>
      <p>If we were to break above all of that resistance, then it would continue the overall uptrend in the British pound, and as things stand right now it looks like we are essentially close to the bottom of the consolidation area. However, I would point out that the price action over the last several weeks has been somewhat soft, and therefore one would have to believe that all it would take is a kick to the market to knock it over and have a go lower.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell in Wednesday morning trading in Asia along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon saw the biggest drop, while BNB dropped the least. A series of economic data in the U.S. released on Tuesday, including earnings reports from retail giants and the rising rate of some Treasury bills, weighed down on equity markets.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin fell 1.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$24,442 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, though it was still up 10% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum fell 2.6% to US$1,658, rising 6.5% over the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Polygon lost 6.1% to US$1.39, though it still booked 10% gains over the past seven days. BNB fell 1.2% to US$311.48, but was still up 5.2% for the week.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.8% to US$1.11 trillion at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The total trading volume over the past 24 hours was up by 3.3% to US$66.70 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday, which was the first trading day of the week, as markets closed on Monday for President’s Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%, the S&P 500 Index dropped 2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day down 2.5%.</li>
        <li>The three key indices posted the biggest single-day losses since Dec. 15 as the S&P 500 cut its year-to-date gains in half while the Dow Jones wiped out almost all of its 2023 gains.</li>
        <li>The two-year Treasury note yield rose to 4.7% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 3.9%. Elevated levels in Treasury bond yields represent a larger upside risk for yields, placing downward pressure on equities.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 policy meeting on Wednesday, which investors will look to for hints on how the central bank may act to tackle inflation.</li>
        <li>Retail giants Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc., released their holiday season earnings reports on Tuesday. Walmart’s revenue rose 7.3% to US$164 billion from the previous year, while Home Depot fell short of expectations, reporting US$35 billion in Q4 revenue. Both companies projected a challenging quarter ahead due to headwinds from supply chain shortages and ongoing inflation in the economy.</li>
        <li>Economic data released on Tuesday suggested that business activity in the U.S. is expanding. The S&P Global services purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to an 8-month high of 50.5 in February, up from 46.8 in the previous month, while the manufacturing PMI rose to a four-month high of 47.8 from 46.9.</li>
        <li>The Fed raised interest rates to the range of 4.5%-4.75% on Feb.1 to fight the inflation, the highest level since October 2007, with the latest Consumer Price Index data up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict a roughly 75% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

      <h3>Coinbase (COIN)</h3>
      <p>Coinbase Global shares jumped after the crypto exchange’s fourth-quarter revenue of $629.1 million came in above Wall Street expectations of $581.1 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg .</p>
      <p>The bar was set relatively low for Coinbase amid a sharp fall in trading volumes last quarter following a decline in crypto prices, the collapse of FTX.com, and increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“Coinbase and crypto proved to be largely resilient in 2022 despite major shocks to the system,” read the company’s shareholder letter. “Idiosyncratic events throughout 2022 exacerbated already weak macro conditions.”</p>
      <p>Coinbase slashed about 20% of its staff in January. The company says it expects a decrease in expenses of more than 30% given its reduced headcount.</p>
      <p>Coinbase shares, which lost about two-thirds of their value over the last year, have rallied sharply since the start of 2023, up roughly 80%. The rise comes amid a resurgence in the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which currently hovers above $24,300 per token.</p>
      <h3>Palo Alto Networks (PANW)</h3>
      <p>Palo Alto Networks’ total revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2023 grew 26% year over year to $1.7 billion. Shares of the cybersecurity firm rallied in after hours.</p>
      <p>"We continue to see our teams execute well in the midst of macroeconomic challenges, helping customers consolidate their security architectures," said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date shares of the Palo Alto-based firm are up about 20% amid an overall rise in tech equities. Cybersecurity firms held up relatively well last year compared to the rest of technology stocks, as demand for keeping networks safe grows amid rising geo-political tensions.</p>
      <h3>Caesars Entertainment (CZR)</h3>
      <p>Caesars Entertainment posted fourth quarter net revenue of $2.8 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.</p>
      <p>The gambling company’s results were positively impacted by a continued consumer shift towards spending in services and experiences, from goods.</p>
      <p>"Our fourth quarter delivered another set of strong operating results as both our Las Vegas and Regional segments each set a new fourth quarter record for Adjusted EBITDA,” Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars Entertainment said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
      <h3>Toll Brothers (TOL)</h3>
      <p>Toll Brothers posted first-quarter earnings per share of $1.70 compared to $1.24 for the same period last year. The home builder also gave upbeat guidance after the housing market started to slow down last year.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/stocks-moving.png" alt="ncx-stocks"/>
      <p>“Since the start of the calendar year, we have seen a marked increase in demand beyond normal seasonality as buyer confidence appears to be improving,” Douglas Yearley, Jr., chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers, said in the company's earnings release.</p>
      <p>Toll Brothers reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance for an adjusted gross margin of 27% and an earnings per share range between $8.00 and $9.00.</p>
      <p>U.S. existing home sales fell to the lowest level in more than 12 years in January, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors. However the pace of decline slowed, signaling the housing market slowdown could could soon be bottoming.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as we continue to see a lot all volatility in this pair. We are hanging around the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that a lot of people pay attention to. Because of this, I think it makes quite a bit of sense that we would see choppy behavior. The 0.69 level being in the same general vicinity probably as to the volatility as well, so it is worth pointing that out also.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, we have to ask whether or not this is an area where the Australian dollar is going to see a little bit of support, or if we are going to continue to see negativity. A lot of this will come down to the interest-rate markets, and whether or not traders are starting to focus on tight monetary policy in the United States, or if they are going to focus more on the China reopening situation. After all, the Australian dollar is highly levered to the Chinese economy and of course the demand for Aussie commodities.</p>
      <p>The global growth situation is tenuous at best, but a lot of traders are starting to pin their hopes on China pulling everybody through. If that’s the case, then Australia will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. However, if this market were to break down below the hammer from the Friday session, I suspect at that point we will see further selling pressure on the Aussie dollar, sending it toward the 0.67 level. Regardless, I would anticipate a lot of choppy behavior, but it is worth noting that we have recently seen a significant selloff from the 0.7150 level that has yet to be truly challenged.</p>

      <p>STX, the native token of Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks Network, is surging as the recent arrival of the Ordinals protocol has unleashed a new narrative of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p>Stacks Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 for smart contracts focused on establishing the world's biggest and oldest blockchain programmable – a dominant feature of Ethereum and its competitors like Solana, which currently account for a majority of global NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.</p>
      <p>Stacks has a separate ledger to store data outside the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications similar to those on Ethereum and Solana. STX, known for being the first token offering qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is used to incentivize Stacks miners and participants in the proposed Stacks bitcoin (sBTC) system, which is aimed at making bitcoin fully programmable.</p>
      <p>The token has risen nearly 50% to $0.60 in the past 24 hours, taking the month-to-date gain to 125%. Prices were quoted as high as $0.84 early Monday, the highest since May, CoinDesk data show. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin (BTC) has risen just 6% this month.</p>
      <p>The outsized move comes as the crypto community goes gaga over Ordinals, which went live on Jan. 21, allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, Ordinals are like drawing artwork directly on satoshi (sats), the lowest denomination of a bitcoin, while NFTs on Ethereum are analogous to an authenticity certificate from the creator that is separate from ether.</p>
      <p>The number of newly created Ordinals or NFTs inscribed directly into Satoshis on Bitcoin crossed the 100,000 mark last week, causing network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p>Per Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, the growing popularity of Ordinals would bode well for layer 2 solutions.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals on Bitcoin L1 are complementary to Bitcoin NFTs on L2s like Stacks. Ordinals have a natural limit on the L1 scale, and L2s provide a clear scalability path," Ali tweeted Monday. "Wallets like Xverse and & Hiro are amongst the first to release or work on Ordinals."</p>
      <p>Activity in NFTs on Stacks has picked up in the wake of the Ordinals' rising popularity. Data from DappRadar shows trading volume on Gamma.io, a Stack-based Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has increased by more than 1,000% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, volumes on Megapont have increased by 125%. Per data tweeted by Ali, there is an active community of artists and creators on Stacks and people have minted 650K Bitcoin NFTs on the layer 2 solution.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin blockchain has been very successful, leading to a general Bitcoin NFT fever," CK Cheung, investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, said. "Stacks is a beneficiary of this as it is an L2 supporting smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin Network. People could mint new Bitcoin NFTs on top of Stacks with a lower cost and higher speed."</p>
      <p>Last week, the bitcoin-focused Web 3 wallet Xverse rolled out support for Ordinals. At the same time, Hiro Wallet added support for inscriptions on its testnet, with Ali describing the same as Metamask for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Early this month, Gamma.io unveiled a no-code creator platform for NFTs on native Bitcoin through the use of ordinals, opening doors for users to create inscriptions without having to run a full Bitcoin node or write any code. Gamma's new launch essentially made Ordinals accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals (inscriptions) are similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the smallest value of Bitcoin (satoshis). This is now opening up the use case for NFTs and merging them with the Bitcoin network security layer," Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in an email while pointing to the upcoming "Building on Bitcoin Hackathon" as the key event to watch out for in the short term.</p>
      <p>The hackathon, scheduled from Feb. 24 to March 7, will have participants build their own smart contracts using Clarity, programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.</p>
      <p>"This virtual hackathon is driving a lot of attention as Stacks uses 'Clarity,' a programming language for writing smart contracts that might be easier to learn than Solidity. The hackathon will reveal in the next two weeks if everybody can now build smart contracts without too much technical knowledge," Thielen noted.</p>
      <p>Finally, on top of all this, STX is seemingly drawing a haven bid, according to Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik.</p>
      <p>"STX is also one of the rare tokens approved by the SEC. So in these uncertain times when the regulator is going after a lot of crypto companies, an SEC-approved token also sounds like a good thing to the market," Malik said.</p>

      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin (BTC) gained 1.97% to US$25,002 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, and has gained 14.79% on the week. Ether inched up 0.46% to US$1,704, gaining 13.2% over the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
        <li>“BTC repeated its March 2020 downside wicking depth below the 200-day MA (moving average),” wrote pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital, adding that Bitcoin will rally once it reclaims the 200-day MA as support, which is around US$25,000.</li>
        <li>XRP rose the most, gaining 2.37% to US$0.3998, and strengthened 7.85% on the week. Ripple Labs, which developed the Ripple payment network powered by XRP, said on Monday it is hiring engineers and has about 75 open positions.</li>
        <li>Solana dropped the most among top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos, by 1.78% to US$26, but gained 23.84% in the last seven days. Polygon’s Matic fell 1.46% to US$1.47, but strengthened 24.54% on the week.</li>
        <li>Asian markets were mixed on Tuesday. The Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.12% while the Shanghai Composite strengthened by 0.49%.</li>
        <li>“While the current macroeconomic environment may cast a shadow over global exports, and the Fed may still continue with its rate hikes, China’s domestic demand remains robust,” Jack Lee, China A-shares fund manager of Schroders, said.</li>
        <li>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.71% at Tuesday’s close while Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.21%.</li>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA, near the 0.69 level. 0.69 level has been important more than once, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see noise there. As we have broken above that moving average, we also saw a bit of downward pressure, so now it looks as if the market is trying to figure out what it wants to do for a longer-term move.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar will be highly levered to commodities, and of course the idea of global growth. With China reopening, there is a bit of hope, but it also is probably worth noting that the global economy itself looks a bit shaky to say the least. The market had recently rallied all the way to the 50% Fibonacci level, only to start selling off quite drastically. Those impulsive candlesticks above should continue to weigh heavy upon the market, especially if we see commodities lose some steam.</p>
      <p>It is probably worth noting that the hammer from the Friday trading session is a candlestick that you should be paying close attention to, because if we were to break down below there, it would be a serious breach of support. Not only would we be breaking down below the hammer, and also the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that will attract a lot of attention by systematic traders. To the upside, I think that the 0.70 level will continue to be a bit of the ceiling, as it is psychologically important, and we have seen a lot of action in that area.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that inflation is still an issue in both Australia and the United States, so the interest rate situation between the 2 currencies may not be as clear as others, but as a general rule of the dollar tends to move in one direction against all currencies. In other words, you can pay attention to multiple currency pairs, and notice the overall direction of the dollar in order to trade this market.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier.

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier. That being said, the market also is sitting just above the crucial 200-Day EMA, so the question will be whether or not it can offer support. The 50-Day EMA sits underneath there and is trying to curl back to the upside so I would anticipate quite a bit of noisy behavior. The market has been repudiated at the ¥135 level, but if he can break above there it has a clear shot to the ¥137.50 level.</p>
      <p>If we can break above there, then the market can continue to go much higher. All things being equal, this is a situation where we see a lot of volatility over the next several days as the Bank of Japan continues to fight higher interest rates, meaning that they will be printing more Japanese yen, thereby driving down the value of that currency. On the other side of the equation, you have the Federal Reserve keeping a very tight monetary policy, so thereby offering a bit of support to the US dollar, despite the fact that may not necessarily be their intention. As long as there is a huge amount of inflation in the United States, that will be a continuous issue.</p>
      <p>It may also be worth noting that the market had recently bounced from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, so that is something that a lot of technical traders will pay close attention to. Beyond that, the ¥127.50 level was where that 50% Fibonacci level showed up, and of course it’s also an area that previously had seen support. With all that, it’s very possible this may remain a “buy on the dips” type of market.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin is closing in on $25,000 per coin as the entire cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose to $1.17tn.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation was trading at $24,500 on Monday, up 12.4% in the past week.</p>
      <p>The second largest cryptocurrency ethereum ETH-USD stood at $1,689 as of the time of writing, up 11.7% in the last seven days.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin shot above $25,000 late on Sunday evening UK time as Asia began the working week, revealing a positive price-movement signal.</p>
      <p>Other cryptocurrencies such as Solana SOL-USD, Polkadot DOT-USD, and Polygon MATIC-USD also experienced gains, with increases of 20%, 19%, and 18.5% in the past week respectively.</p>
      <p>Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told Coindesk that $23,000 was bitcoin’s new support level, adding that the coming week would decide whether the digital asset would hit $30,000 or not.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was critical for bitcoin to reclaim $23,000 if we were to see more upside action.</p>
      <p>“With February coming to an end, another bullish monthly close may be what the market needs for bitcoin to test $30,000.”</p>
      <p>On Monday morning bitcoin trader Matthew Hyland tweeted: "Bitcoin lower time frame, really hard to tell if the big breakout above $25.2k comes right here."</p>
      <p>Hyland tweeted a chart that suggested bitcoin would drop to a low of around $22,000 before rebounding above $25,000.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is heading into a quiet week in terms of macroeconomic triggers that could affect the price. There are a few US data releases, such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, coming up.</p>
      <p>All eyes are on the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting being held on 15 and 16 March where a decision for the next benchmark interest rate hike will be made. Futures markets are pricing in a less hawkish Federal Reserve, forecasting a 25 basis point rate hike at the meeting in March.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>
      <p>The Euro has seen a lot of action at 1.06, but I suspect it is only a minor support level, perhaps opening up the possibility of a challenge of the 1.05 level, which is much more important in the sense that it was a swing low, and of course the 200-Day EMA sitting in that same area has a huge effect as well. Because of this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we see that area challenged, especially as we have seen a couple of impulsive negative moves over the last couple of weeks. With this, I think the real battle begins in that area.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA on a daily close, then I think you could have a situation where the Euro gets hit really hard. At that point, it would not surprise me at all to see the Euro go down to parity again. On the other hand, if we turn around and take out the shooting star from the Tuesday session, it opens up a move to the 1.10 level above, but that area looks extraordinarily difficult to break higher than, due to the fact that we had seen so much massive selling at what is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and the 50% Fibonacci level from the big move lower.</p>

      <p>The US dollar has rallied during the course of the week to test the ¥135 level. The ¥135 level of course is an area that has been important multiple times, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have failed there. Nonetheless, the overall candlestick is rather bullish looking, and therefore I think we probably have a little bit of follow-through coming.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied during the course of the week to test the ¥135 level. The ¥135 level of course is an area that has been important multiple times, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have failed there. Nonetheless, the overall candlestick is rather bullish looking, and therefore I think we probably have a little bit of follow-through coming. After all, if the Bank of Japan continues to have to fight interest rates, it’s likely that we will continue to see the US dollar overcome the Japanese yen strength. We also had recently pulled back from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and now it looks like we are ready to go to the upside again. Given enough time, I do think that we probably have a much higher exchange rate.</p>
      <p>If we can break above the ¥135 level, then it is possible that we could go to the ¥137.50 level. After that, the ¥140 level is worth paying close attention to. On the other hand, if we turn around and break down below the ¥130 level, that would probably show quite a bit of negativity, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move down to the ¥127.50 level. You can see that the pullback was rather brutal, but then again, the move higher was brutal to get up there. Now that the Federal Reserve may finally be convincing people that they are serious about keeping interest rates higher for longer, we could very well see this market take off to the upside. Ultimately, this is a market that remains very noisy, but I do think given enough time we probably try to get back to those highs at this rate.</p>

      <p>Binance secretly moved large sums of money from its supposedly independent US partner to a company managed by the crypto giant's boss Changpeng Zhao, according to Reuters</p>
      <p>The publication said Thursday that Binance's US partner started transferring money to Merit Peak in 2020 and sent the trading firm over $400 million in the first quarter of 2021, citing banking records and company messages.</p>
      <p>Merit Peak is a market-maker trading firm owned by Binance CEO Zhao, who's often referred to by his initials CZ.</p>
      <p>Binance claims that Merit Peak and Binance's US partner Binance.US operate independently from the global exchange, which CZ co-founded in 2017.</p>
      <p>But Binance.US executives didn't know that it had been sending money to Merit Peak and were concerned when this came to light, according to company messages seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>Then-CEO Catherine Coley reportedly asked a Binance executive for an explanation in late 2020, calling the transfers "unexpected" and saying that "no one mentioned them".</p>
      <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has previously probed ties between Binance.US, Merit Peak, and another CZ-owned trading firm called Sigma Chain AG, according to a Wall Street Journal report published in February 2022.</p>
      <p>Binance.US did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment.</p>
      <p>It's not clear why the money was sent from Binance.US to Merit Peak or if any of the funds belonged to US customers.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in November that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had used at least $4 billion of customers' money to prop up Alameda Research, a supposedly independent trading firm that he managed.</p>
      <p>FTX had already filed for bankruptcy when that story broke but Bankman-Fried was subsequently arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the US to face eight counts of fraud.</p>

      <p>It's been a tough couple of years for Chinese stocks. The Covid pandemic, and Beijing's zero-Covid policy, have slammed the economy. Meanwhile, regulatory crackdowns vs. technology and data-centric firms such as Alibaba, Tencent TCEHY and NetEase NTES have been a major headwind. The tech crackdown seems to have eased.</p>
      <p>U.S. tensions are a concern. In recent months, the White House has barred shipments of key chip technology to China, adding to tariffs and other curbs on Chinese goods. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China has rolled back Covid restrictions significantly. With an end to lockdowns and other severe controls, a massive wave of infections took hold. But investors are looking beyond to brighter days ahead. With China New Year holidays out of the way, will the Chinese economy finally rebound?</p>
      <p>While the current top China stocks to buy or watch are dominated by e-commerce plays, don't forget EV startups such as Nio (NIO) and Li Auto (LI). Like global giant BYD (BYDDF), all are taking on Tesla (TSLA) in the world's largest EV market.</p>
      <h3>Tencent Stock</h3>
      <p>Tencent is China's messaging and gaming giant, with major payments exposure and with key holdings in an array of Chinese companies, including JD.com.</p>
      <p>Earnings have declined for the past four quarters, and revenue for the past two, as a big crackdown on internet platforms and new mobile games took a toll. Earnings growth is expected to return in 2023.</p>
      <p>JD.com stock peaked at 94.46 in February 2021, tumbling to a five-year low of 23.52 on Oct. 24, 2022. Since then shares have doubled, vaulting above moving averages</p>
      <p>Shares hit 52.88 on Jan. 27 and have pulled back. TECHY stock has fallen below its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Ideally, Tencent would forge a new base after its big run.</p>
      <p>Tencent stock is listed in Hong Kong and trades over the counter in the U.S.</p>

If that support withholds, we might see another impulse toward US$25,300,” wrote Kenjaev, adding that “there will be more speculations over the SEC and Paxos, so keep your newsfeed open.”</p>
      <p>Kenjaev sees less correlation between traditional and crypto markets, as prices are mainly driven by industry developments.</p>
      <p>“The cryptocurrency market is more focused on developments inside its own ecosystem and the connectivity of this decentralized ecosystem to the centralized one. Hence, every development related to the regulators vs crypto companies, especially U.S. regulators, does and will affect the crypto market,” wrote Kenjaev.</p>
      <p>“Be mindful of the release, testing, deployment and adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The major macroeconomic data I would like to see is the national debt. There has been a lot of money spent in recent years and governments will be looking to recover it,” wrote Kanjaev, adding that “the government knows that there is a good portion of funds floating in Web3.”</p>
      <p>The global crypto market cap stood at US$1.09 trillion on Friday at 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 6.86% from US$1.02 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$458 billion market cap represented 42.2% of the market, while Ether accounted for 18.7%.</p>
      <h3>Biggest Gainers</h3>
      <p>Astar Network’s Astr token was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Astar Network is a multi-chain smart contract network focused on Web3 innovation.</p>
      <p>Astr rallied 51.72% this past week to change hands at US$0.1099 after the announcement of its partnership with Sony to launch a Web3 incubation program to support developers building Web3 projects.</p>
      <p>Decentralized gaming developer’s Magic token was the second biggest gainer, up 44.94% to trade at US$2.18. The token started its rally on Feb. 13, after the company launched a new Game Builders Program supported by Arbitrum to incentivize high-potential games building on Treasure, by offering developers access to open-source code as well as advisory and marketing support.</p>
      <h3>Next Week</h3>
      <p>For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, a “death cross” appeared on its weekly chart. This meant that the 50-week small moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator, stood below the 200-week SMA for the first time.</p>
      <p>Kasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, said that the death cross “gives very little input,” since it only shows that Bitcoin price performed better in the last 50 weeks compared to the last 200 weeks.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin prices charted another significant formation, with its first “golden cross” on the daily timeframe since the beginning of the crypto bear market in November 2021. A golden cross means that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. Historically, Bitcoin has charted multiple golden crosses in previous cycles before a sustained rally.</p>
      <p>“A record high 66.9% of circulating BTC has not moved in over a year,” tweeted Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, adding that “Bitcoin bear markets end when there are no sellers remaining, the price slowly starts drifting up due to (any) marginal buyer, and the next wave of adopters learn BTC is the least uncertain money.”</p>
      <p>According to Kenjaev, this suggests that Bitcoin holders were more conservative. “They are waiting for the right time to sell and are hedging over the upcoming recession. The state of the global economic conditions now leads to more uncertainty than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The reason why the situation is not changing with current global developments is that investors do not see the same scenario happening. Current market conditions look risk-attractive and favorable, although it’s very early to call it the next bull run. We shall at the very least wait for improvements from regulatory bodies globally.”</p>
      <p>“Some patterns suggest that an ideal scenario for Bitcoin would be to drop near US$19,500-19,300,” he added, hoping for “a decline to US$19,500 and a jump to US$30,000.”</p>
      <p>On Feb. 12, Blockstream chief executive officer Adam Back predicted that Bitcoin would exceed US$200 million in market cap, bringing BTC prices to US$10 million by 2032.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether rebounded in Thursday morning trading in Asia amid broad gains in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies after a bout of profit-taking and mixed economic indicators sent prices lower on Wednesday. Solana, Polygon and Cardano led gains among the top 10 by market capitalization. U.S. equities were mixed overnight. Tesla beat earnings forecasts but the poor outlook from Microsoft on Wednesday and an interest rate hike expected next week kept a lid on trading.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin rose 2% to US$23,096 in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen 11.66% in the seven days to date and resumed a strong run up since the start of the year after hitting a speed bump on Wednesday. Ether added 3.43% to US$1,610, up 6.36% in the same week, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
        <li>Solana jumped 7.78% to US$24.56 to post a week-to-date growth of 17.9%. Solana recently opened pre-orders for its blockchain-focused mobile phone Solana Saga, which is expected to launch as early as Q1 this year.</li>
        <li>Polygon added 3.85% to US$0.99 after the Fractal NFT gaming site on Wednesday said it was expanding onto the Polygon network. Cardano rose by 3.91% to US$0.37.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization grew 2.72% to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume saw a 12% increase to US$61.86 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equity markets had a mixed day on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dipped almost 0.2%.</li>
        <li>More economic indicators are out on Thursday in the U.S., including GDP, durable goods orders and jobless claims, which could provide direction to equities through the end of the week.</li>
        <li>Members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are in a so-called blackout period before they meet next week – Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 – to decide the next move on interest rates. Analysts from CME Group predict a 99.8% chance of an increase of 25 basis points.</li>
        <li>Last month, the Fed raised interest rates by 50-basis points to between 4.25% and 4.5%, the highest in 15 years, to try and slow the pace of inflation and a number of indicators suggest that slowdown is happening. However, some investors remain concerned about the U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, tipping into a recession.</li>

      <p>By Stephen Culp</p>
      <p>NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced in choppy trading on Thursday as investors grappled with an onslaught of economic data and a string of mixed corporate earnings, all while eyeing the clock as it ticks down toward next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.</p>
      <p>While all three major U.S. stock indexes were green, megacap momentum stocks, buoyed by Tesla Inc's earnings beat and upbeat sales forecast, helped put the Nasdaq in the lead.</p>
      <p>A raft of data showed the U.S. economy fared better in the fourth quarter than analysts expected, and the labor market remains tight, despite some signs of weakening demand. This is a double-edged sword for investors, as it could embolden the Fed to keep key interest rates at restrictive levels for longer.</p>
      <p>While financial markets have largely priced in a 25 basis point rate from the central bank next Wednesday, that sentiment is not unanimous.</p>
      <p>The data "suggests a 50-basis-point rate hike next week and 25 basis points in March, and then possibly an end to the tightening cycle," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "I think the Fed wants to make sure that the markets don’t get ahead of themselves."</p>
      <p>"(The Fed tightening) hasn't worked its way through the system, but you’re beginning to see cracks in consumption and inflation," Cardillo added. "I'm sure the Fed is going to take note of that."</p>
      <p>Fourth-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with more than one fourth of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 69% have beaten consensus estimates, up from 67% on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Analysts now see aggregate fourth quarter earnings falling 2.7%, worse than the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1, but an improvement over the 3% annual decline as of Wednesday, per Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.4 points, or 0.26%, to 33,831.24, the S&P 500 gained 24 points, or 0.60%, to 4,040.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 122.49 points, or 1.08%, to 11,435.85.</p>
      <p>Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy led the percentage gainers, boosted by rising crude prices due to signs of increasing demand from China.</p>
      <p>Tesla Inc provided the most upside muscle to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, its shares jumping 9.4% in the wake of its earnings report.</p>
      <p>Chevron Corp announced it would triple its budget for share buybacks, which sent the oil major's stock up 4.4%.</p>
      <p>Among losers, IBM Corp fell 4.3% in the wake of its announcement that it would cut jobs divest some assets after falling short of its annual cash target.</p>
      <p>Southwest Airlines Co slid 4.0% after warning of current quarter losses.</p>
      <p>And despite forecasts of strong demand for air travel in 2023, the broader S&P 1500 Airlines index was off 1.6%.</p>
      <p>That might have something to do with Mastercard Inc's disappointing current quarter revenue forecast, cited an expected diminishing pent-up travel demand. The consumer payments company's shares were down 1.7%.</p>
      <p>Mastercard rival Visa Inc is due to post results after the bell, as is chip bellwether Intel Corp.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 26 new lows (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Johann M Cherian and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)</p>

      <p>BNB could oscillate in a range in the next few hours/days.</p>
      <p>Short-term holders saw a sharp decline in profits after Tuesday’s sudden drop.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin [BTC] dropped from $23k to below $22.5k on Tuesday, pulling the altcoin market into a short-term plunge. Binance Coin [BNB] declined by 9% in the same period, dropping from $323 to $293. </p>
      <p>However, bulls found steady support of around $297 and launched a price recovery. At press time, BNB’s value was $303.6o and could oscillate in the range below for the next few hours/days. </p>
      <h3>BNB remained steady at the $300 – $310 range</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>On the three-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded from the 40 level and showed that buying pressure increased after dropping to the 40-mark.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was rejected at the zero mark, forcing it into an uptick on the positive side, which indicated that the BNB market was strengthening.</p>
      <p>Therefore, BNB could oscillate between the demand zone ($293 – $300) and $310 in the next couple of hours. BNB has traded within this range since 21 January, only to witness a false breakout on 24 January. A retest of the $319 could also be likely if BTC reclaims the $23k zone.</p>
      <p>However, BNB could drop below the demand zone if BTC breaks below $22.5k, invalidating the bias described above. But such a drop could settle on the 100-period EMA (exponential moving average) or $286.9 level.</p>
      <p>Swing traders should therefore track RSI rejection at the 50-mark, CMF crossover, and BTC price action to minimize risk exposure.</p>
      <h3>Short-term holders’ profits tanked and sentiment flipped into negative</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>According to Santiment, BNB’s 30-day MVRV (market value to realized value) dropped from 36% to 6% at press time. Short-term holders’ profit tanked by 30% as BNB’s price correction wiped out recent gains.</p>
      <p>The price decline was also followed by an elevated negative weighted sentiment and a drop in demand in the derivatives market, as evidenced by the drop in the Funding Rate. However, the Funding Rate rested on the neutral line and any increment could boost BNB’s recovery.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, a further drop in the Funding Rate could set BNB to retest the demand zone below $300. Moreover, the active address in the past 24 hours also dropped, but there was a slight uptick at press time. Any further increase in active addresses could boost the recovery momentum.</p>

      <p>The S&P 500 metric showed a price correction while Ethereum continued an uptrend.</p>
      <p>Percent Supply in Profit was over 67% at press time, representing a four-month high for Ethereum.</p>
      <p>The price of Ethereum [ETH] rose dramatically over the last few days, which indicated a bull trend. Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum and equity prices go in opposite directions</h3>
      <p>Recent information indicated that Ethereum’s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment’s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.</p>
      <p>When the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor’s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.</p>
      <h3>Percent Supply in Profit hits four-month high</h3>
      <p>Besides the stock market’s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.</p>
      <p>The graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <h3>MVRV shows reduced loss</h3>
      <p>When the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of Ethereum.</p>
      <p>Though a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <h3>Ethereum remains in the overbought zone</h3>
      <p>A daily timeframe chart of Ethereum’s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory.</p>

      <p>This article is the first in what I hope will be a regular weekend series. A variety of technical analysis techniques will be used to look at probable moves for the S&P 500 (SPY) in the week ahead. No personal bias will be shown and no predictions will be made either. Rather, the market will be viewed in probable outcomes using inflection points - if it is going down, where is it likely to go? If it is going up, where is it likely to test? Likewise, if it breaks a key level to the downside, what does that tell us about the market and where is it likely to go?</p>
      <p>The technical analysis itself will be kept fairly simple. After all, one line drawn from the early 2022 top and through the peaks has been the main technical barrier all last year and continues to be important. Tried and tested techniques such as classic patterns, trendlines, major moving averages and horizontal support form the body of the analysis. Demark systems are also used to detect exhaustion and volume profile shows additional areas of interest.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 chart will be analyzed on monthly, weekly and daily timeframes, then the information collated into an actionable summary at the end.</p>
      <h3>The Market Narrative</h3>
      <p>While the focus of this article is primarily on technical analysis, a more complete picture combines it with fundamental and sentiment studies.</p>
      <p>Last week saw the sixth consecutive drop in inflation and there is now plenty evidence it should continue to fall. The Fed won this particular battle. However, the labor market, and particularly wage growth, remain a risk to any further shift away from the hawkish stance. For now, the message from the Fed is that rates will stay high for an extended period.</p>
      <p>But is this warning just a bluff to keep markets from getting too bullish too quickly? The market seems to think so - the expectation is that the Fed are going to slow the pace of hikes to a halt over the coming months and then start cutting in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>The question next week and beyond is whether this situation merits the bullish breakout brewing on the charts. Sentiment has improved drastically in recent months and is reflected already in today's price. A Fed pivot has been a primary driver for months. What is left to continue the rally? Easing in the labor market and confirmed dovish signals from the Fed would complete the bullish narrative, but neither are going to happen next week. Personally, I wouldn't trust the rally until a weekly close above 4050.</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Monthly</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The monthly chart shows the SPX trading inside the range set in December. Resistance is at the range high of 4101 and beyond that, 4325 at the high of August. Support is at December's low of 3764 and the 3491 low.</p>
      <p>There are no exhaustion signals in either direction (using Demark methods).</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Weekly</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>Last week's bar closed near the highs. This gives an upside bias into early next week to at least take out last week's 4003 high.</p>
      <p>Resistance comes in at 4048.5 at the 50ma, which will drop to around 4045 next week. There is also trendline resistance (or the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern) near the same level at 4040. If this area is broken, 4101 is the next resistance, then 4203 at the large weekly gap. Support is at the 3764 pivot low and the 200ma at 3680.</p>
      <p>Again, there are no exhaustion signals in either direction.</p>
      <p>The trend is down (lower lows and lower highs).</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Daily</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The daily chart is at a very important juncture. Friday's session closed at 3999 which was above the 200dma at 3981 and above the trendline at the same level.</p>
      <p>Resistance has been cleared and now only comes from higher timeframe references. Initial support is at 3928 and the gap, then last Tuesday's low of 3877.</p>
      <p>There are no exhaustion signals but a sell set up is now on bar 6. This could become active on Tuesday and Wednesday (bars 8 and 9) and suggests a pause/pullback could materialize.</p>
      <p>The trend is neutral/up. Price is above all major MAs and the bearish trendline.</p>
      <h3>Scenarios for Next Week</h3>
      <strong>Bullish</strong>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, there is a bullish bias due to the strong weekly close and the close above the daily 200ma and trendline. A test of weekly resistance at 4040-45 therefore looks likely. If this breaks, it should bring the monthly resistance of 4101 into play, with 4203 a stretched target above that.</p>
      <strong>Bearish</strong>
      <p>Exhaustion signals could trigger on Tuesday/Wednesday should there be a rally early in the week. Failure to break 4040-45 could flip the view bearish/neutral if it leads to a drop back under 3975-80 and the 200dma/trendline which is declining by around 3 points a day. Daily references of 3928 and 3877 could then be tested, with 3764 good weekly support and unlikely to be broken.</p>
      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>The S&P 500 is testing very important technical resistance and looks to be making a bullish breakout following the positive CPI report last week. One thing to note is that this is a rather obvious and closely watched move and it still needs to clear weekly resistance at 4040-45 and hold its gains to cement a bullish look.</p>

      <p>One of last year’s top-performing equity exchange-traded funds, the VanEck Steel ETF (SLX), stealthily outperformed broader markets. After 2022’s 14% gain, investors may wonder, can it do so again?</p>
      <p>The ETF is the only one covering steel specifically, investing in global steel producers. It manages $101.3 million in assets, only one-fourth of what it managed in 2008. Still, SLX is about the only way to access the performance of steel directly.</p>
      <p>Those outflows may seem surprising. SLX has performed well in in previous years, with three-and five-year annualized returns of 21.2% and 10.2%, respectively. Still, it’s lost nearly $19 million last year despite its positive performance and its indirect exposure to a key global commodity.</p>
      <p>Although nearly half of the portfolio is invested in U.S. equities, the fund also offers exposure to countries like Brazil (19.4%), the U.K. (10.7%) and Italy (5.6%). Top holdings include Rio Tinto plc (12.4%), Vale, S.A. (12.1%) and Nucor Corp. (6.8%).</p>
      <p>SLX’s liquidity isn’t great, with FactSet rating it at the lowest end of its scale, but SLX’s volumes and spreads are within the normal range relative to other similarly sized equity funds. It’s also not likely to close given it has more than $100 million in assets and has been trading for more than 14 years. Its 0.55% expense ratio is at the low end for a specialty equity ETF.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that SLX has a dividend yield for the past 12 months of 4.26% versus 1.65% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).</p>
      <h3>What’s Ahead for Steel</h3>
      <p>Steel price gains may be fairly muted this year after having been driven up by supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war, but nothing too extreme in either direction, according to Christos Rigoutsos, a senior economist with S&P Global.</p>
      <p>“It's not a matter of weakness in pricing—it's the fact that prices will tend [toward] normal rather than actually being weak or lower than that,” he told ETF.com, pointing out that steel prices over the past year have been “sky high” and that the situation is simply normalizing.</p>
      <p>He notes that steel producers will idle production when surpluses of the commodity build up. Add that to the fact that prices are already only slightly above cost, there’s not much downside, according to Rigoutsos. However, he also emphasizes steel is not recession-proof, as manufacturing tends to fall off in that kind of environment.</p>
      <p>Given all that, there may be some upside remaining for SLX, while a similar level of outperformance is unlikely to continue very far into 2023. However, its specific focus and global nature could provide additional diversification to a portfolio with little added risk.</p>
      <p>With recession fears high, a fund focused on companies producing a crucial commodity could be seen as an attractive prospect.</p>

      <p>Solana was on track to bring some developments to its network.</p>
      <p>SOL’s TVL and price suffered a decline while NFT trades ran smoothly.</p>
      <p>Solana [SOL] has been locked in FUD for a long time, affecting its price drastically. However, the network had some positives to show as its development continued.</p>
      <p>After rumors surfaced linking the Solana ecosystem to the troubled FTX and SBF debacle, SOL came under close examination. The FTX incident left a lasting impression on the network, and the corresponding FUD was difficult to dispel.</p>
      <p>It appeared, however, that Solana had not let up on the gas in its pursuit to prove its worth. Given current statistics, how well has this worked out?</p>
      <h3>Upcoming updates</h3>
      <p>The Firedancer is an upcoming improvement scheduled for rollout on Solana to bolster the reliability of its network. Formed by Jump Crypto, Firedancer is a decentralized validator client written in C++.</p>
      <p>After going live, Solana will join Ethereum as the second multi-client chain. The likelihood that a flaw may cause severe damage to the network is reduced when numerous sets of code exist that can “run” the chain from scratch. </p>
      <p>Additionally, in the event of a flawed implementation, the network gains from a second, unrelated implementation are less likely to suffer from the same flaws simultaneously. Similarly, Firedancer will be released in 2020 and can provide significant performance boosts.</p>
      <h3>Dev activity resumes an upward trend</h3>
      <p>There was some relief after Solana suffered from a noticeable decline. Development on Solana was steadily picking up, according to the Development Activity statistic at press time. Dev activity, according to the metric, was approximately 20.2.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-SOL-13.33.27-16-Dec-2022.png" alt="santiment" />
      <h3>Active developers reduce on Solana and other blockchains</h3>
      <p>Data from the Token Terminal also showed a decline in developers working on well-known blockchains. Because of the decrease in Solana’s developers from over 2,000 to 75, the number of active developers in the general crypto space fell from 3,700 to roughly 1,600.</p>
      <p>This would imply that the drop in Solana affected the crypto industry.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-active-developers.png" alt="token-terminal" />
      <h3>Price and TVL face sharp decline</h3>
      <p>In recent weeks, SOL’s price has been stagnant at best. It was trading at roughly $13 at the time of this writing, a sharp decline from its $30 price at the start of November 2022.</p>
      <p>The Price Range statistic revealed that Solana lost 60% of its value since the last time it was in the $30 range. The low volume, devoid of any significant spikes – indicated by the volume indicator – showed that the asset had not been traded actively in recent weeks.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SOLUSD_2022-12-16_13-33-39.png" alt="Tradingview" />
      <p>A review of Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also revealed that it had drastically decreased in value. The TVL observed was still over $1 billion as of October.</p>
      <p>However, it was discovered that the current worth was around $280 million. The TVL showed a severe decline to which the FTX event and the current market trend contributed.</p>
      <h3>NFT trade remains active</h3>
      <p>The NFT measures provided some promise despite the negative trends shown in the SOL price and Solana’s TVL. Solana was still active, as indicated by the Total NFT trade Volume statistic, expressed in USD. The statistic revealed that NFT sales on the network had sales of over $1.4 million on 6 December alone.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-SOL-13.33.20-16-Dec-2022.png" alt="santiment" />
      <p>Additionally, Helium will switch to the Solana network in the first quarter of 2023, according to the Helium Foundation. This is despite the present difficulties of the Solana network. The network hasn’t ceased developing despite its challenges; therefore, it might endure and emerge from the FTX fallout.</p>

      <p>Around 13% of the American population — or 43 million people — have held cryptocurrency at some point in their lives, new research from JPMorgan Chase has revealed.</p>
      <p>According to a Dec. 13 report titled "The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use,” this number has risen dramatically since before 2020, when the figure was only around 3%.</p>
      <p>The latest data from JPMorgan comes from analyzing checking account transfers from a sample of over 5 million customers. It found that 600,000 customers in this sample group transferred cash to crypto accounts at some point during period from 2020 to 2022.</p>
      <p>The study also noted that cryptocurrency holders typically made their first crypto purchases during spikes in crypto prices. During this time, the amount of cash being sent into crypto exchange accounts typically far outweigh the cash being removed. In other words, most people were holding onto their crypto during this time period.</p>
      <p>This changed in early 2022 as crypto prices fell, according to JPMorgan. In recent months, cash transfers into crypto exchanges have only slightly exceeded cash transfers out of them.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan says that this is a result of both price declines in crypto and a broader trend of the savings rate declining in the United States since the pandemic:</p>
      <p>“We view the rise and fall of crypto use since the onset of COVID as consistent with the joint relationship between retail flows and market prices seen in prior research. Additionally, the trend in crypto flows also tracks dynamics of household savings, which spiked to historic highs early in the pandemic but has begun to reverse.”</p>
      <h3>Who's buying?</h3>
      <p>The report also weighed in on whether certain demographic groups are more likely to buy crypto. It found that men of all ages buy significantly more crypto than women, and that younger people buy significantly more than older people. For example, the report found that over 25% of millennial men have bought crypto, whereas only around 12% of millennial women and 5% of male baby boomers have.</p>

      <p>A breakdown of crypto ownership by demographic. Source: JP Morgan Chase</p>
      <p>he research also found that crypto holdings were relatively minor for most individuals, with median flows equal to less than one week’s worth of take-home pay. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, about 15% of crypto owners had more than a month’s pay invested in crypto</p>
      <p><strong> Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin has bottomed as “everyone who could go bankrupt has gone bankrupt”</strong></p>
      <p>The crypto market has gone through a dramatic fall in 2022. Bitcoin has fallen from a 2022 high of $47,459 in March to $17,208 at the time of writing, while Ether has fallen from $3,521 in April to $1,273 at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>This fall in the crypto market has been the result of market shocks such as TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin losing its peg in May and crypto exchange FTX going bankrupt in November.</p>
      <p>Trading fees have fallen on many crypto exchanges, and Coinbase has even stated that its revenue has fallen by nearly 50%.</p>
      <p>But despite this decline in crypto prices and trading activity, this new report indicates that crypto ownership has still increased over the course of the last few years.</p>

      <p>A tweet by the blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment in the past day shows that several altcoins have seen “big upticks in address activity and dormant wallets awakening to move their funds.” The tweet read: “Others [altcoins] are staying stuck in the mud and are more likely to fall behind.”</p>
      <p>Santiment focused on three altcoins in its latest report such as Uniswap (UNI), Ren (REN), and yearn.finance (YFI).</p>
      <p>One example of an altcoin that has seen its network activity increase quite impressively after a consolidation period is YFI, according to the blockchain intelligence firm.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the report showed that network activity for REN did not pick up as much as YFI because of the project’s “complicated financial situation.”</p>
      <p>Lastly, UNI experienced strong growth before when the project announced its NFT marketplace. Network activity for UNI has continued to grow, even compared with the NFT-related pump, according to the report.</p>

      <p>REN on the other hand, is up 2.88% over the last 24 hours. In addition to strengthening against the U.S. dollar, REN’s price has become resilient against BTC and ETH by 4.80% and 4.61%, respectively.</p>
      <p>UNI is also currently down 1.52%, but, it strengthened against Bitcoin by 0.44% and also strengthened against ETH by 0.24% over the same time period.</p>

      <p>Per the terms, PayPal has been added as an option for cryptocurrency transactions to ConsenSys’ MetaMask, which is a digital cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
      <p>Notably, users of MetaMask will now be able to buy and transfer the second-most-popular cryptocurrency called Ether seamlessly by just tapping the “buy” button and logging into their PayPal accounts.</p>
      <p>The underlined integration will aid MetaMask in expanding its reach to customers using Web3 applications like play-to-earn games and metaverse applications, among others.</p>
      <p>Similarly, PayPal will also be able to gain traction among Web3 application users, whose number is rising rapidly.</p>
      <p>Currently, the PayPal option within MetaMask is available to selected U.S. users. The feature will be rolled out eventually across the United States.</p>

      <p>PayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. Quote</p>
      <h3>Growing Crypto Efforts</h3>
      <p>The latest move bodes well for the company’s strengthening crypto initiatives.</p>
      <p>Apart from the latest move, PayPal offers a feature called crypto on Venmo, which lets Venmo customers buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly within the Venmo app. Customers can also check cryptocurrency trends from the app. </p>
      <p>Further, the company offers its cryptocurrency service in the United Kingdom, which allows users to buy, hold and sell digital currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin directly from their PayPal accounts.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s acquisition of a digital asset security technology provider — Curv — remains noteworthy.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of a feature called Checkout with Crypto, which allows customers to seamlessly convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency at the checkout, is another positive.</p>
      <p>With all these endeavors, PayPal remains well-poised to penetrate the booming cryptocurrency market rapidly amid the pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of digital currency transactions.</p>
      <p>Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.2% between 2022 and 2030.</p>
      <h3>Competitive Scenario</h3>
      <p>We note that the latest move, along with the above-mentioned efforts, is likely to strengthen PayPal’s competitive position against one of its biggest peers, Block SQ.</p>
      <p>Block facilitates the buying and selling of bitcoins via its Cash App. It also intends to develop a bitcoin mining system, with the help of which it strives to carry out the processes of mining, maintaining, setting up and purchasing bitcoin efficiently.</p>
      <p>Apart from Square, Shopify SHOP is also leaving no stone unturned to gain a strong foothold in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
      <p>Shopify allows its merchants to accept payments in bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies. It recently took a step further in the crypto market by making its platform NFT-enabled, which allows users to mint and trade collectibles.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, PayPal’s strong crypto initiatives and the growing crypto volume are likely to strengthen its position in the intensifying cryptocurrency battle against the above-mentioned companies.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider</h3>
      <p>Currently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector can consider a better-ranked stock like Arista Networks ANET, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
      <p>Arista Networks has lost 8.9% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ANET is currently projected at 17.5%.</p>

      <p>Avalanche recently announced the launch of the mobile version of its Core Wallet.</p>
      <p>Avalanche’s latest developments have caused AVAX to rally by over 5% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Avalanche has recently started rolling out new features and forming new alliances to impact the ecosystem. Owners of AVAX have been forced to grasp onto hope despite these actions because the effects have been minimal if any at all. However, the most recent developments revealed by the ecosystem may attract new users and impact AVAX.</p>
      <h3>Mobile core wallet</h3>
      <p>On 13 December, Avalanche announced the release of its Core Wallet app for mobile devices. In its initial release in June of this year, the Core wallet had native Avalanche bridging capabilities, allowing users to connect with dApps on the Avalanche network.</p>
      <p>In the past, users who wished to transfer their assets to the network had to resort to third-party tools like MetaMask, which offered a similar Ethereum-Avalanche bridge.</p>
      <p>Avalanche’s latest change could pave the way for the company to attract more consumers. This has the potential to boost both ecosystem participation and user count.</p>
      <p>The network claimed that the Core wallet’s other distinctive features included the ability to trade Avalanche, Bitcoin easily, and Ethereum assets. Also, the transfer of Bitcoin and Ethereum to participate in Avalanche DeFi dApps, and track real-time asset price movements in a unified watchlist. </p>
      <h3>Avalanche’s recent partnership</h3>
      <p>Avalanche has also recently launched a learn-and-earn program in collaboration with Robinhood. By incorporating Robinhood’s “learn and earn” feature, the ecosystem would be able to onboard a wider variety of users.</p>
      <p>In related news, Avalanche had also recently established a relationship with Alibaba Cloud. As a result of the collaboration, the platform would be offering Node-as-a-Service. This service would allow any operator interested in running a node to do so by simply connecting to an already-built architecture without a complex set-up.</p>
      <h3>AVAX in daily timeframe</h3>
      <p>By taking a glance at AVAX in a daily timeframe, it was possible to see more clearly how these feature enhancements and partnerships are yet to have the expected impact.</p>
      <p>The asset’s price movement trend was underwhelming when examined. But it was clear that it had increased by more than 5% over the preceding trading period.</p>
      <p>This would imply a favorable reaction to the network’s most recent news. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading with less than a 1% increase in value, and it appeared to be rising.</p>

      <p>While actuarial tables and claims adjustments sound boring, market-beating returns are always a good time.</p>
      <p>This year, the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK) has been one of the few stock exchange-traded funds outside of energy that handily topped broader markets like the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>The fund is up about 12% and recently hit its all-time high. It did this in one of the worst equity market environments in years, and without exposure to energy stocks. Energy is the only major sector with positive returns year to date, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 16%.</p>
      <p>Three ETFs trading on U.S. exchanges provide exposure to insurance stocks. With 58 holdings, IAK is the broadest that covers this category in addition to being the top performer year to date. With $558 million in assets under management, it’s also the largest compared with the $525 million SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the $347 million Invesco KBW Property & Casualty Insurance ETF (KBWP). Those two funds are up 4.3% and 11.2%, respectively.</p>
      <p>All but one of IAK’s top 10 holdings—including names like Chubb Corp., Progressive Corp. and MetLife Inc.—have notched positive returns during 2022, the majority of them in the double digits. The top firms in the fund have mostly reported strong earnings and revenues this year, boosting their performance in a tough market, and spurring the ETFs gains.</p>
      <p>IAK is probably doing well for a number of reasons, one being that insurance companies do well in unstable economic times because as more or less steady companies, they aren’t affected by the downturn in the economy like other industries. They also provide essential services whose demand profile doesn’t fluctuate with economic cycles.</p>
      <p>Rising interest rates also boost insurance companies’ “float,” the pool of money, collected as premiums, which they invest conservatively and use to make claims payments. The Federal Reserve boosting rates from around zero to 4% Monday has helped IAK’s companies, and with more hikes expected this year and next, the insurance industry may be positioned well for strong profits for some time.</p>
      <p>So far this year, IAK has seen strong inflows, gaining $422.3 million year to date, while KBWP pulled in $248.5 million, and KIE—a broadly based insurance fund like IAK—gained just $62.8 million. With more room to run, those funds could pull in even more.</p>
      <h3>An Analyst’s View</h3>
      <p>The Deloitte Center for Financial Services’ report on its 2023 outlook the insurance industry in September 2022 noted that while insurers are “facing a host of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges,” they exhibited agility during the pandemic in terms of adopting remote work and adapting to customer needs.</p>
      <p>They should continue to maintain that momentum, Deloitte advises, by investing in technology and their workforce while focusing on innovation and their customers.</p>
      <p>The report also notes that ESG considerations will become increasingly important to stakeholders, and that those could be major differentiators in competing within the insurance peer group. The firm declined to comment further when contacted.</p>
      <p>Deloitte U.S. Insurance Leader Karl Hersch said in a video in its outlook that the sector is at a “post-pandemic inflection point” during which it could “reset the narrative” around it.</p>
      <p>While the report cites inflation as cutting into profitability, it notes several opportunities for growth. Those include small businesses, in particular when it comes to cybersecurity-related mishaps.</p>
      <p>The push toward green energy could result in $125 billion in spending on such matters projected by 2030. In the digital realm, including cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse, the report notes that only 17% of related assets are insured.</p>

      <p>Aave grew on the Arbitrum network but declined on Ethereum</p>
      <p>Arbitrum’s TVL witnessed growth, and the number of transactions on the protocol rose</p>
      <p>According to new data from Dune Analytics, Aave [AAVE] users on Arbitrum witnessed major growth. More and more users have increasingly switched to Arbitrum, indicating that L2 adoption was rapidly rising.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ARB-ETH.jpeg" alt="What does aave growth on arbitrum" />
      <p>Arbitrum is a major layer 2 solution that has been contributing to the growth of the sector. Its TVL grew tremendously over the last few weeks and sat at 1.08 billion at the time of writing after appreciating by 1.24% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>However, despite the TVL growth, Arbitrum’s activity and TPS were unable to rise. The latter declined by 26.78%, according to data from L2beats.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hp-image.png" alt="defiLama"/>
      <p>Regardless of the momentary decline in Arbitrum’s TPS, the number of transactions on the protocol grew significantly since September. Even though there was volatility observed in the number of transactions, overall, the number of transactions kept moving in a positive direction.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the number of unique users on the L2 protocol increased from 1.7 million to 12.16 million in the last month, according to Arbiscan.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-11-at-1.28.31-PM.png" alt="arbiscran"/>
      <h3>State of Aave on Ethereum</h3>
      <p>The growing presence of Aave on Arbitrum had a correspondingly negative impact on Aave’s presence on the Ethereum [ETH] network.</p>
      <p>As can be seen from the image below, the volume for Aave on Ethereum decreased rapidly. Additionally, large addresses also lost interest in Aave. This was indicated by the declining top addresses holding AAVE on the network.</p>
      <p>Aave’s network growth decreased as well, thus, signifying that the number of new users transferring the coin for the first time on Ethereum’s network shrank.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether the growth of Aave on the Arbitrum network points to a larger shift to L2 networks.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, AAVE was trading at $61.52, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

      <p>Auditing firm Mazars has released 
      a report about Binance’s BTC reserves. The auditing firm has reached the same conclusion as Binance itself. As of November 
      22 at 23:59 UTC, Binance held enough bitcoins and wrapped bitcoins to cover all users’s balances on the exchange.</p>
      <p>Binance had already launched a proof-of-reserves website nearly two weeks ago to reassure its users following 
        the collapse of FTX. Today’s audit just confirms that Binance doesn’t appear to be lying, according to Mazars</p>
      <p>As always, there are some limitations with these proof-of-reserves exercises. The biggest caveat is that Binance 
          is only focusing on BTC assets for now. If you hold other cryptocurrencies, there is no proof-of-reserves system 
          just yet.</p>
      <p>While bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency, Binance offers hundreds of different crypto assets. So let’s 
        hope this is just a first step.</p>
      <p>Similarly, both Binance and Mazars looked at the BTC reserves on November 22 at 23:59 UTC. While it’s hard to provide 
        an instant snapshot, Binance hasn’t committed to a timeline for its proof-of-reserves reports. For instance, the crypto 
        exchange could share data every week or every month.</p>
      <p>Now that you are aware of all that, let’s talk about what’s in Binance’s proof-of-reserves system and the Mazars 
        auditing report. Binance uses a Merkle tree to include all individual user accounts and generate a cryptographic seal. 
        This Merkle tree covers user balances across several Binance products — Spot, Funding, Margin, Futures, Earn and Options 
        Wallet.</p>
      <p>Binance also listed all the wallets that hold customer assets. Blockchain explorers let you obtain the balance of 
        crypto wallets just by looking at the public addresses of those wallets.</p>
      <p>Binance found that its users collectively held 575,742.4228 BTC ($9.7 billion at today’s exchange rate) and that it 
        has enough BTC and wrapped BTC to cover 101% of these funds. It then contacted Mazars so the auditing firm could 
        independently verify what the crypto exchange was saying.</p>
      <p>Mazars asked Binance to perform tiny transactions at a specific time to show that the wallets were indeed under 
        the control of Binance. For some wallets, it used a different method. In that case, Mazars used Etherscan and BSCscan 
        to check that the ETH and BSC wallets belong to Binance.</p>
      <p>The auditing firm checked the scripts that Binance is using to extract the total value in user accounts. Mazars 
        checked that there wasn’t any duplication of user IDs and constructed its own Merkle tree using this open source 
        script developed by SilverSixpence.</p>
      <p>Some users have a negative BTC balance because they have been using the margin and loan service with other crypto 
        assets as collateral. “Binance’s margin and loan products are always over-collateralized and subject to additional 
        risk controls (such as auto liquidation). These products ONLY utilize funds from customers actively using Binance 
        Earn products such as savings whose terms permit this,” Binance said as a comment in the auditing report.</p>
      <p>If you take everything into account, Mazars and Binance reach the same conclusion when it comes to BTC reserves. 
        This is a good step when it comes to transparency. Now, let’s hope there will be more announcements in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released a new report on Wednesday from global 
        financial audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showing that Binance's customer bitcoin  reserves are 
        overcollateralized.</p>
      <p>"At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total 
        platform liabilities," Mazars said in an announcement. 
        The exact percentage was 101%.</p>
      <p>The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX because of liquidity issues has rivals rushing to improve the 
        transparency of their financial reserves. The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin 
        is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.</p>
      <p>However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting 
        at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "They did a comparison of balances per public key address 
        from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or 
        depositories," said McKenna.</p>
      <p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report," she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based 
        accounting firm that provided auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017 was accused of “serial 
        violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
        Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports in August.</p>
      <p>Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis. 
        Assets included were customers’ spot, options, margin, futures, funding, loan and earn accounts for BTC and wrapped 
        bitcoin held on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.</p>

      <p>Messari’s statistics revealed that the top three DEXes, Uniswap, Balancer, and Sushiswap had a combined transaction volume of nearly $7 billion over the previous 30 days. However, a closer look at each one showed how much growth had occurred.</p>
      <p>In terms of transaction volume and TVL, Uniswap was ranked first among all DEXes. The trading volume for Uniswap revealed that there had been noticeable rises in recent weeks. This demonstrates the platform’s increased trading activity.</p>
      <p>The trading volume for the DEX reached approximately $300 million, which was a record for the year so far, according to the trade volume chart.</p>

      <p>It had experienced $3.57 billion in trade volume over the previous 30 days, a rise of 65.32%. Although the TVL showed a modest dip, it still had $2.6 billion, at the time of writing.</p>

      <p>In the previous 30 days, its revenue had likewise climbed by over 64%.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a glance at Balancer revealed that the DEX experienced a sharp increase in trade volume. Trading volume reached its all-time high during this time, rising by a staggering 730.38% in the past 30 days to reach $2.09 billion</p>
      <p>The overall revenue climbed by 40.68% and was $1.09 million during the same time frame. Also, TVL had grown by almost 600% and was worth $699 million, as of this writing. </p>
      <h3>Overall TVL sees an uptrend</h3>
      <p>It was also evident that there had been a rise in total TVL during November, according to DefiLlama data. From the statistics, it was clear that there had been a reduction in recent months. Starting from $57 billion in October, the TVL observed at the time of this writing was above $92 billion.</p>

      <p>The obvious increase in these DEXes’ trading volumes is evidence of how recently that area has come to receive a lot more attention. The increased interest could lead to a more balanced crypto economy and encourage participation outside of centralized exchanges.</p>
      <p>This is not meant to minimize or overlook the significance of centralized exchanges within the ecosystem; rather, DEXes provide investors with different options.</p>

      <p>Semiconductor exchange-traded funds surged after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed Monday it bought more than $4 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>ETFs including the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD), the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) gained more than 4% and were among the five biggest ETF movers on Tuesday. A handful of Taiwan and semiconductor funds rounded out the top 10 ETF movers.</p>
      <p>Berkshire’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing disclosed 4.12 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to Apple Inc., purchased in the third calendar quarter. Apple is the top holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares have been among the most beaten-down in what has been a declining tech market this year. Even with today’s more than 12% gain, TSMC—as it’s also known—has dropped 32% this year, more than the 27% decline in the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ).</p>
      <p>That decline may have been seen as a buying opportunity for Buffett, who, along with business partner Charlie Munger, are the world’s most famous value investors. Semiconductors are generally priced low at present: XSD’s price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times earnings falls beneath QQQ’s 22 times.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Berkshire purchases, geopolitical tensions in the region may have taken a breather after President Joe Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Indonesia Monday and committed to working together to solve economic and security issues.</p>
      <p>China has promised to reunify Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, which the U.S. opposes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s July trip to Taiwan in support of the country infuriated China and led the country to cut off some diplomatic channels with the U.S.</p>
