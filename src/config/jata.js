      <p>Meta Platforms Inc. META 7.25%increase; green up pointing triangle said it would cut roughly 10,000 jobs over the coming months, the Facebook parent’s META 7.25%increase; green up pointing triangle second wave of mass layoffs in what it says is an effort to be more efficient in a difficult economy.</p>
      <p>Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an email to staff on Tuesday that the company would in the coming months conduct multiple rounds of job cuts, as well as cancel some projects and reduce hiring rates as part of what he has dubbed the “year of efficiency.”</p>
      <p>Company recruitment teams will be cut first, followed by restructuring and layoffs in its technology groups in late April, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Business teams will face layoffs in May, he added. The company will also stop hiring for about 5,000 open positions.</p>
      <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said his company must cope with a longer term change in the economy, marked by the end of low interest rates, growing geopolitical tensions and costly new regulations.</p>
      <p>“At this point, I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “Given this outlook, we’ll need to operate more efficiently than our previous headcount reduction to ensure success.”</p>
      <p>Meta said in a securities filing Tuesday that it expects to lower its annual expenses by roughly $3 billion from an estimated range it gave on Feb. 1. It now expects to spend a total of $86 billion to $92 billion this year, including the costs of its layoffs and restructuring, which it said could total $3 billion to $5 billion.</p>
      <p>Meta’s share price rose more than 7% in Tuesday trading to just above $194, far outpacing the broader market. The stock is up more than 60% so far this year, though well below its all-time high of more than $380 in September 2021.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s announcements come after Meta’s layoff of about 11,000 employees—or roughly 13% of its workforce—last fall, in the first broad head-count reductions in the company’s history. The new round of cuts is likely to add up to roughly the same magnitude as those layoffs, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p> 
      <p>The new rounds of layoffs are likely to hit non-engineering roles especially hard, and among projects that will be cut are some wearable devices that were in the works at Reality Labs, Meta’s hardware and metaverse division, the Journal reported.</p> 
      <p>While saying that layoffs were difficult, Mr. Zuckerberg in his email on Tuesday also described what he said were the advantages of a leaner organization, expanding on a new view of management for the current economy that he has been laying out in recent months.</p>
      <p>He said that many managers will “become individual contributors.” He also said that managers might now have up to 10 direct reports, rather than just a handful because the company now doesn’t expect to increase its head count as quickly as in the past.</p>
      <p>“It’s well-understood that every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “Every manager typically reviews work and polishes off some rough edges before sending it further up the chain.” He said the company will be “focused on canceling projects that are duplicative or lower priority” because those can take broader resources and managers’ attention from core priorities.</p>
      <p>“In retrospect, I underestimated the indirect costs of lower priority projects,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.</p>
      <p>Mr. Zuckerberg said the company analyzed performance data and found that engineers who joined the company in person before working remotely or remained in person performed better on average than those who joined the company remotely. The analysis also showed that engineers perform better on average when they work in person with teammates at least three days a week, he said. The company’s hypothesis is that in-person work helps build trust and is more effective, he said.</p>
      <p>He encouraged employees to find more time to work with colleagues in person. “We’re focusing on understanding this further and finding ways to make sure people build the necessary connections to work effectively,” he said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Meta reported a head count of 86,482 employees at the end of December, up 20% from a year earlier, but said that figure still included most of the 11,000 employees affected by the November layoffs.</p>
      <p>Meta’s new layoffs add to waves of job cuts that have roiled Silicon Valley, where tech giants are now retrenching after adding employees by the tens of thousands through the pandemic. Technology companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have cut thousands of jobs in recent months.</p>
      <p>Since 2022, layoff tallies at tech companies have reached nearly 300,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that is tracking job cuts in the industry. Broadly, employment in the information industry was unchanged between July and January, according to federal data. Total employment rose in that time.</p>
      <p>Meta said Tuesday that it plans to extend a hiring freeze and pause internal transfers in the company while the layoffs and restructuring occur. Those freezes will lift in each unit once the restructuring there is complete.</p> 
      <p>U.S. employees affected by the layoffs will get 16 weeks of severance pay, plus an additional two weeks for every year they worked at Meta, the company said. Outside the U.S., packages will vary depending on local laws.</p>

	    <p>(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, according to a source familiar with the matter, as scrutiny mounts over the firm's sudden collapse and regulators scramble to contain the fallout.</p>
	    <p>The U.S. Justice Department is probing the sudden demise of the bank, which was shuttered on Friday following a bank run, the source said, declining to be named as the inquiry is not public. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a parallel investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probes.</p>	
	    <p>Spokespeople for the SEC, SVB and the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>	
	    <p>The investigation is in early stages and may not result in allegations of wrongdoing or charges being filed, the source said. Officials are also examining stock sales by officers of SVB Financial Group, which owned the bank, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Sunday said in a statement the agency is particularly focused on monitoring for market stability and identifying and prosecuting any form of misconduct that might threaten investors during periods of volatility.</p>
      <p>The rapid demise of Silicon Valley Bank and the fall of Signature Bank have left regulators racing to contain risks to the rest of the sector. On Tuesday, ratings agency Moody's cut its outlook on the U.S. banking system to "negative" from "stable."</p>
      <p>SVB Financial Group and two top executives were sued this week by shareholders, who accused them of concealing how rising interest rates would leave its Silicon Valley Bank unit susceptible to a bank run.</p>

      <p>US stocks rallied Tuesday as traders digested the latest inflation data, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track to snap a five-day slump.</p>
	    <p>The consumer price index increased 0.4% in February from January, putting the annual rate at 6%. Both were in line with estimates and signaled continued cooling in inflation as the Federal Reserve weighs its next step on interest rates.</p>
	    <p>Regional bank stocks staged a comeback after getting demolished on Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank contagion concerns on Monday. Shares of First Republic, PacWest, and Western Alliance were up double-digit percentage points.</p>	
	    <p>The collapse of both banks has fueled speculation the Fed will take a less hawkish stance. Goldman Sachs predicted the central bank will pause interest rate hikes at next week's FOMC meeting, citing "considerable uncertainty."</p>	
	    <p>"In light of recent stress in the banking system, we no longer expect the FOMC to deliver a rate hike at its March 22 meeting with considerable uncertainty about the path beyond March," analysts wrote in a Sunday note.</p>

The asset class is also benefiting from market talk that turmoil in the banking industry could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to halt interest rate increases.</p>
	    <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
      <ul><li>Bitcoin, world’s largest cryptocurrency, gained 8.2% to US$24,404 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 8.8%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum rose 3.93% to US$1,677, after rising 6.72% on the week.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Dogecoin strengthened 2.31% to US$0.07242, but lost 3.54% in the past seven days. Polygon’s Matic token gained 2.04% to US$1.16, after rising 0.83% on the week.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization, rose 0.75% to US$0.999, but slipped 0.09% on the week. USDC had momentarily lost its peg to the U.S. dollar after the shutdown of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) but recovered after Circle, its issuer, announced a new partnership with Cross River Bank.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>“We expect the stress in the banking sector, and the wider impact on confidence, now will give the central bank [U.S. Federal Reserve] cause for pause on its rate hike program,” said Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The global crypto market capitalization gained 4.39% to US$1.07 trillion, while the total crypto market volume rose 16.93% to US$90.47 billion in the past 24 hours.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>All Asian equity markets dropped on Tuesday as investors braced for the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 2.27%, while South Korea’s Kospi fell 2.56% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 declined 2.19%.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The Shanghai Composite lost 0.72% while the Shenzhen Component Index dropped 0.77%, despite China announcing it will resume issuing visas from March 15 as it eased its Covid-zero policy. Investors are also looking forward to a series of China’s economic indicators expected to be published on Wednesday.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Investors also await U.S. inflation data later on Tuesday. The February consumer price index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, is expected at 6% on year, dropping from the 6.4% for the year that ended January 2023, but still well above the U.S. central bank’s 2% target.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>“Despite most warning signs flashing red, the U.S. has continued to defy gravity,” said Keith Wade, chief economist and strategist at Schroders. “We still think that higher interest rates, which we now expect to peak at 5.25% in the second quarter of 2023, will lead to a recession. However, it is likely to be relatively short and shallow.”</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The Forkast NFT 500 index rose 0.7% to 4,064.39. Planet IX – Gravity Grade rallied 51.67% as the day’s biggest gainer, followed by EGoldMiner that strengthened 44.63%.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>European stocks traded slightly higher after a two-day sell-off. The STOXX 600 inched up 0.1% and Germany’s DAX 40 rose 0.53%, while Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.32% to a two-month low, as investors assessed spillover effects from the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>HSBC’s shares fell 1.28% during the day, following news that the bank would inject £2 billion (US$2.4 billion) of liquidity into the U.K. unit of SVB.</li></ul>

      <p>Yahoo Finance’s Jennifer Schonberger joins the Live show to discuss Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte’s call on Congress for the urgent approval of stablecoin regulation.</p>
      <p>RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, well, turning now to Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger, who's been following this story all day and has more on this. Hey, Jennifer.</p>
      <p>JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Hey there, Rachelle. That's right. Just spoke with Circle's Chief Policy Officer and Head of Strategy Dante Disparte, who is urgently calling on Congress to pass legislation to regulate stablecoins in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure that led their stablecoin to break the buck.</p>
      <p>In a conversation just moments ago, Disparte saying that he favors legislation from House Financial Services Committee Chair and Ranking Member Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters. Disparte telling me, quote, "I have been uploading to the internet since 2019. And since 2019, there has been an ongoing persistent conversation about risk. And we've been met with complete inaction."</p>
      <p>"I do think if this is the digital assets Dodd-Frank moment, then it is the time to act. Just as it took 2008 to get comprehensive banking reforms, I think it's well past time that the US acts. And to act is not to ban innovation, it's to encourage responsible innovation. But there is a shortfall in action right now"</p>
      <p>Now, Disparte also told me it was a run on a bank that triggered a loss of confidence in a fully reserved digital dollar. He says, that's the irony. Whereas, with the Tarra LUNA blowup, he called that financial alchemy of the very worst kind. He says, the way Circle operates is more conservative than the Paypals of the world, and it was a loss in confidence in a bank that triggered a crisis and risk in Circle's business.</p>
	    <p>Now, Circle's stablecoin broke the buck after it revealed that it had a $3.3 billion in reserves tied up in Silicon Valley Bank, causing investors to dump the stablecoin. Circle pledged from its balance sheet over the weekend to make any holder whole If the bank didn't go through an orderly wind down. And that helped to restore that deep peg on the chain.</p>
	    <p>Circle holds 80% of its reserves in short term treasuries and 20% in cash. As a depositor of Silicon Valley Bank, Circle will be made whole by the FDIC. Now, Rachelle, Disparte told me that there is a serious policy conversation that needs to be had here. And that regulators' intervention over the weekend was the right move to stave off contagion. I will have more on our website on finance.yahoo.com. Rachelle.</p>

      <p>US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced Monday that it had reached a deal to buy biotech firm Seagen, specializing in innovative cancer treatment, for $43 billion.</p>
      <p>Pfizer is offering $229 per share in cash, and the companies expect to complete the transaction later this year or in early 2024, they said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Pfizer is deploying its financial resources to advance the battle against cancer," said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.</p>
      <p>"Oncology continues to be the largest growth driver in global medicine, and this acquisition will enhance Pfizer's position in this important space," Bourla added.</p>
	    <p>Seagen -- leading in the research, development and commercialization of cancer treatments -- is growing, with a 12 percent increase in revenue forecast this year to $2.2 billion.</p>
	    <p> Targeting cancer -</p>	
	    <p>The company, headquartered in Washington state, came to major drugmakers' attention with its work on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are "designed to preferentially kill cancer cells."</p>
      <p>The agreement has been approved by the boards of both firms, and will be subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.</p>	
      <p>A deal would have to pass heightened scrutiny from antitrust regulators.</p>	
      <p>The Biden administration has also been seeking to keep down drug prices.</p>	
      <p>Pfizer expects to finance the deal through $31 billion of new long-term debt and a "combination of short-term financing and existing cash."</p>	
      <p>For now, Pfizer Oncology has a portfolio of 24 approved innovative cancer medicines that generated $12.1 billion in 2022, it said.</p>	
      <p>The deal with Seagen would double Pfizer's early-stage oncology clinical pipeline, the pharmaceutical firm added.</p>	
      <p>"The addition of Seagen's world-leading ADC technology will position us at the forefront of innovative cancer care," said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief development officer of oncology and rare disease.</p>	
      <p>Seagen CEO David Epstein added that "the proposed combination with Pfizer is the right next step for Seagen to further its strategy."</p>	
      <p>According to reports, Pfizer competitor Merck was in talks with Seagen previously but these did not go through.</p>	
      <p>Pfizer expects that Seagen may contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030, "with potential significant growth beyond 2030," the company said.</p>		
	    <p>Seagen's portfolio includes three products with ADCs, including Padcev, which is used for the treatment of urothelial cancer.</p>
      <p>The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into combining Padcev with Merck's Keytruda in treating patients with advanced bladder cancer who are not eligible for chemotherapy.</p>

      <p>The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) lost 2.25% to close at 7,574 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris tumbled 2.58% to 7,034 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) fell 2.66% to 15,017.</p>
      <p>Across the pond, US stocks started off the week with a sour sentiment before bouncing back after federal banking regulators took aggressive actions to stem the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) rose 0.47% to 32,060 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.49% to 3,880 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) gained 1.13% to 11,264.</p>
      <p>President Joe Biden addressed the nation on Monday regarding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Biden said that “no losses will be borne by the taxpayers” and he assured customers that they would be protected. The president also vowed to ask Congress and the banking regulators to strengthen rules for banks.</p>
      <p>Biden explained that he instructed his team to protect US workers and small businesses and detailed their actions to protect customers' deposits and not put taxpayer dollars at risk, to hold those responsible accountable, and not to protect investors in the bank.</p>
    	<p>Back in London, HSBC (HSBA.L) bought the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank (SVBUK), securing the deposits of more than 3,000 customers worth £6.7bn ($8bn).</p>
	    <p>The Treasury said the deal with HSBC involved no taxpayer money and the Bank of England said deposits were secure.</p>	
	    <p>HSBC said it paid just £1 for SVBUK after the bank failed on Friday.</p>
      <p>All SVBUK services will continue to operate as normal and customers should not notice any changes, the statement said.</p>
      <p>"This acquisition makes excellent strategic sense for our business in the UK," HSBC said.</p>
      <p>"It strengthens our commercial banking franchise and enhances our ability to serve innovative and fast-growing firms, including in the technology and life-science sectors, in the UK and internationally," Noel Quinn, HSBC group chief executive, said.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank — which specialised in lending to technology companies — was shut down by US regulators on Friday in the largest failure of a US bank since 2008.</p>
      <p>UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “Today the government and the Bank of England have facilitated a private sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK. This ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support.</p>
      <p>“I am pleased we have reached a resolution in such short order.</p>
      <p>“HSBC is Europe’s largest bank, and SVBUK customers should feel reassured by the strength, safety and security that brings them.”</p>
      <p>"HSBC shareholders may have some concerns about the bank snapping up assets which have been under such a cloud of uncertainty, particularly the exposure to bonds, but HSBC says it expects a gain to arise from the acquisition.</p>
      <p>"This will be hugely welcomed by the government, given the looming crisis risked overshadowing budget day, as a big tech sector bailout would not have been a good look when millions have been told there is little extra money to ease the cost of living crisis."</p>
	    <p>Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: "It means that SVBUK will avoid insolvency proceedings and its customers will be able to access deposits and banking services as normal from today. European markets look set to open higher as a crisis in the banking sector is averted for now."</p>
      <p>Dom Hallas, executive director of Coadec, a lobby group representing UK tech start-ups, said Monday’s deal “saved hundreds of the UK’s most innovative companies".</p>
      <p>Financial stocks were among the fallers in London, with Standard Chartered (STAN.L) losing 6.52%, investment manager abrdn (ABDN.L) off 3.41%, and Barclays (BARC.L) falling 5.79%.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) lost ground and was trading at around $82 per barrel amid concerns of further interest rate increases.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 (^N225) lost 1.11% to 27,832 points, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) in Hong Kong gained 1.98% to 19,702. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also gained ground, climbing 1.20% to 3,268 points.</p>

      <p>The U.S. bank crisis deepened Monday as the financial industry continued to reel from last week's closing of vital venture capital lender Silicon Valley Bank and its parent SVB Financial (SIVB) Friday — marking the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. On Sunday, regulators shuttered cryptocurrency-focused Signature Bank (SBNY) and moved the assets to a bridge bank while agencies search for a buyer. Investors continued to dump bank stocks early Monday.</p>
      <p><strong>Bank Stocks Reel</strong></p>
      <p>Financial stocks continued to fall Monday as investors felt for the limits of the bank crisis triggered on Friday. Trading for First Republic was halted early Monday after FRC stock fell nearly 68% after the open to 26.45 after sliding roughly 15% on Friday. WAL stock trading was temporarily paused as shares of Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) toppled 80% Monday morning after shedding 20.88% Friday. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) was briefly halted as the stock plummeted nearly 52% Monday after collapsing 37.9% before the weekend. Zions Bancorp (ZION) retreated 34% Monday.</p>
      <p>First Horizon (FHN) trading halted early Monday as FHN stock fell 23% in the morning. And Regions Financial (RF) trading was paused after sliding nearly 6% Monday.</p>
      <p>Charles Schwab (SCHW) slid more than 16% Monday morning after losing 11.7% Friday. Bank of America (BAC) weakened about 4.3% in early trading after inching lower Friday.</p>
      <p>JPM stock pared early losses to less than 0.5% Monday. It climbed 2.5% Friday, one of the day's few banking bright spots.</p>
	    <p><strong>Bank Crisis: Signature Bank Closed</strong></p>
	    <p>On Sunday, state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank and appointed the FDIC as the receiver. Signature Bank is the 20th largest bank in the U.S. and roughly 30% of its deposits came from crypto customers.</p>	
	    <p>The FDIC transferred all deposits and "substantially" all of the assets to Signature Bridge Bank. The bridge bank is a full-service bank operated by the agency as it markets the institution to potential bidders.</p>
      <p>As of Dec. 31, Signature Bank had $110.4 billion in total assets and $82.6 billion in deposits. Signature Bank operations and banking activities will resume Monday, March 13. Regulators guarantee that, "all depositors of the institution will be made whole. No losses will be borne by the taxpayers." In a joint press release Sunday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg approved systemic risk exceptions for Signature Bank to soothe fears of a bank crisis.</p>
      <p>"Today we are taking decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system," the regulators wrote in the release. "This step will ensure that the U.S. banking system continues to perform its vital roles of protecting deposits and providing access to credit to households and businesses in a manner that promotes strong and sustainable economic growth."</p>
      <p><strong>A Special Assessment On Banks</strong></p>
      <p>Regulators approved similar systemic risk exceptions for Silicon Valley Bank. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected. In addition, officials removed senior management, according to the announcement. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law. And Sunday, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will make additional funding available to eligible institutions to assure banks have the ability to meet all their depositors' needs.</p>
      <p>"The U.S. banking system remains resilient and on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry," regulators wrote. "Those reforms combined with today's actions demonstrate our commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors' savings remain safe."</p>
      <p><strong>First Republic Shores Up Funds</strong></p>	
	    <p>On Sunday, First Republic Bank (FRC) secured additional liquidity from the Federal Reserve Bank and JPMorgan (JPM) to shore up its operations. The additional borrowing capacity brings the total available, unused liquidity to fund operations to more than $70 billion, the company announced in a press release.</p>
      <p>"First Republic's capital and liquidity positions are very strong, and its capital remains well above the regulatory threshold for well-capitalized banks," CEO Jim Herbert said in the announcement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on Monday, Bank of America removed its rating price target on First Republic, from its previous Buy rating and $90 price target. The unexpected bank failures resulted in First Republic "no longer trading on fundamentals," and made the previous targets unreliable, Bank of America wrote in a research note.</p>
      <p><strong>PacWest Operations Update</strong></p>
      <p>On Friday, following the Silicon Valley Bank failure, PacWest Bancorp released an operations update on its current liquidity. PacWest listed $41 billion in assets and $33.2 billion in deposits as of March 9. The Los Angeles-based bank lists $28.3 billion in loan balances, $1.9 billion in cash on hand, $5.3 billion in liquid securities and about $2 billion available from the Federal Reserve Discount Window.</p>
      <p>"Though the banking industry is experiencing significant volatility in light of recent events, we want to reiterate that Pacific Western Bank is a well-performing, well-diversified, full-service commercial bank with more than 20 years of history," CEO Paul Taylor said in the release. "We have been a proven partner to our customers through all economic cycles and are actively adapting in the current economic environment."</p>
      <p>Following the update, DA Davidson analyst Gary Tenner upgraded PacWest to Buy from Neutral on Monday, but lowered the price target to 29 from 31. The bank's financial update was largely in-line with the firm's Q1 expectations, despite contagion concerns, Tenner wrote in a research note.</p>

      <p>On the economic front, eyes will be on the consumer price index on Tuesday. The CPI is expected to rise 0.4%, both overall and excluding food and energy. That would bring the headline CPI inflation rate down to 6% from 6.1% in January, with the core inflation rate easing to 5.5% from 5.6%.</p>
      <p>Earnings continue trickling out at the tail end of the season this week. Among them are Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO), Adobe (ADBE), Dollar General (DG), FedEx (FDX), Five Below (FIVE), GitLab (GTLB) and Lennar (LEN).</p>
	    <p><strong>Stock Market Today</strong></p>
	    <p>Drug giant Pfizer (PFE) agreed to pay $43 billion for biotech Seagen (SGEN). Pfizer shares rose 0.3%, while SGEN stock soared 15%.</p>	
	    <p>Genetic screening tools leader Illumina (ILMN) jumped more than 11% early, on news reports that activist investor Carl Icahn planned to nominate three persons to the company's board of directors.</p>	
	    <p>Electric-vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) traded down more than 2% Monday morning after Wolfe Research downgraded the stock to peer perform from outperform. Dow Jones tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were up after the stock market open.</p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and New Relic (NEWR) — as well as Dow Jones stock Salesforce (CRM) — are among the top stocks to watch in the new stock market correction.</p>
      <p>Palo Alto is an IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock. New Relic was recently an IBD Stock Of The Day. And Salesforce was featured in last week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Today: Oil Prices, Treasury Yields</strong></p>
      <p>After Monday's market open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, and the S&P 500 was down 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite erased sharp losses in morning action, with Seagen and Illumina leading the index.</p>
      <p>Among U.S. exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.1% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) dropped 0.2% early Monday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield tumbled to 3.69% Friday. Then on Monday, the 10-year yield dived to 3.47% in early morning trade, as safe haven trade drove bonds sharply higher following the SVB collapse. The dollar angled lower, losing ground against the euro and the yen.</p>
      <p>Oil prices sold off Monday morning after Friday's brief bounce. West Texas Intermediate futures slid nearly 5% in early trade, trading below $73 a barrel early Monday. Gold and silver also moved sharply higher as investors sought solid ground. Gold jumped 1.4% to above $1,892 an ounce. Silver rallied 3.3%, clearing $21 an ounce.</p>
      <p><strong>Stock Market Correction</strong></p>
      <p>On Friday, the stock market sold off sharply, as the major stock index ended with big losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.45%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.8%.</p>
      <p>Friday's Big Picture column commented, "IBD changed its market outlook to 'uptrend under pressure' Thursday. And after Friday's selloff we've cut our outlook further, to 'market in correction.' This requires investors to avoid any stock purchases and pivot to defensive trading, such as taking profits and cutting losses short."</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Stocks To Watch: Salesforce</strong></p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Dow Jones leader Salesforce showed big upside strength after strong fourth-quarter results. But those gains have mostly disappeared amid the recent market weakness, and now the stock is back below a 178.94 cup-with-handle entry. Still, the stock's recent strength is a reason to monitor the software leader in the coming sessions. CRM stock rose 0.5% Monday.</p>
      <p><strong>Top Stocks To Watch: Palo Alto, New Relic</strong></p>
      <p>IBD Leaderboard watchlist stock Palo Alto Networks continues to trade quietly in a handle after the stock's 12.5% surge on Feb. 22.

      <p>Backstory: New Relic provides a cloud-based suite of software products that enables organizations to collect, store and analyze massive amounts of data in real time. Customers gain increased visibility into their enterprise software to help make data-driven decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>Tesla Stock</strong></p>
      <p>Tesla stock snapped a four-day losing streak Friday, with modest gains. It's trying to find support around its key 50-day line and closed Friday around 55% off their 52-week high.</p>
      <p>Tesla shares fell 2% Monday morning, threatening to erase Friday's gains.</p>

      <p>Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, lost and then regained parity to the U.S. dollar after regulators took over the failed Silicon Valley Bank and guaranteed deposits, including Circle’s, to prevent a broader run on the banking industry.</p>

      <p>Circle Internet Financial’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, lost and then regained parity to the U.S. dollar after regulators took over the failed Silicon Valley Bank and guaranteed deposits, including Circle’s, to prevent a broader run on the banking industry.</p>
      <p>USDC was trading at US$0.9948 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong on Monday, after falling to as low as US$0.8774 on Saturday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Circle held about US$3.3 billion in USDC reserve deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, known as SVB.</p>
	    <p>Cryptocurrencies also bounced back from losses last week, with Bitcoin jumping almost 10% in early trading in Asia, after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – a government body set up after the 1930s Great Depression to provide deposit insurance at savings and commercial banks – said on Sunday that it has taken over SVB.</p>
	    <p>The move to backstop SVB, which had total deposits of more than US$175 billion, went all the way up to the White House and President Joe Biden for approval at the weekend, according to a joint statement by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, indicating the seriousness with which U.S. regulators took the threat of bank failures spreading.</p>	
	    <p>The fall of SVB followed the earlier collapse of another California-based and crypto-linked bank Silvergate Capital last week. The FDIC said Sunday it has also taken control of New York-based Signature Bank, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto industry, due to banking industry risk.</p>	
	    <p>“Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer,” the joint official statement said.</p>
      <p>“We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.”</p>
      <p><strong>Circle</strong></p>
      <p>Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO of Circle, said in a statement dated March 12 in Boston, U.S.: “We are heartened to see the U.S. government and financial regulators take crucial steps to mitigate risks extending from the banking system.”</p>
      <p>Allaire said the US$3.3 billion in USDC reserve deposits held at Silicon Valley Bank “will be fully available when U.S. banks open tomorrow morning. No USDC cash reserves were held at Signature Bank. As a regulated payment token, USDC remains redeemable 1:1 with the U.S. Dollar.”</p>
      <p>FDIC data shows SVB had about US$209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, making it the biggest bank failure in the U.S. since the 2008 financial crisis that included the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a 158-year old investment bank that is the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history with more than US$600 billion in liabilities.</p>
      <p>The FDIC in its Sunday statement said all insured depositors at SVB will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning in the U.S. and that the FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week.</p>
      <p>“As the FDIC sells the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors,” the federal agency said.</p>
      <p><strong>Crypto link?</strong></p>
      <p>New York-based Signature Bank was closed down on Sunday by its state chartering authority, with the FDIC appointed as receiver. At the end of last year, Signature Bank held total assets of around US$110.36 billion with US$88.59 billion in deposits, according to the FDIC.</p>
      <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted on Monday morning in Asia that the firm had about US$240 million in corporate cash at Signature as of Friday, and it is currently facilitating all client cash transactions with other banking partners.</p>
      <p>The U.S. bank failures could be seen as contagion from the crypto industry, but “the collapses of Silvergate and SVB didn’t appear to have direct links with cryptocurrency,” Winston Hsiao, co-founder and chief revenue officer of Taipei-based fiat-crypto exchange XREX, wrote on Sunday in a Facebook post.</p>
      <p>“Crypto firms are actually victims just like many corporates and individuals that deposited at the two banks,” he said.</p>
      <p>US President Joe Biden on Twitter said he is “firmly committed” to holding those responsible for the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapse “fully accountable.”</p>

      <p>As we laid out in last Friday's AAP Weekly Roundup, over the weekend a plan was hatched to stem the impact from SVB Financial (SIVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) via a joint statement released Sunday night by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

      <p>As we laid out in last Friday's AAP Weekly Roundup, over the weekend a plan was hatched to stem the impact from SVB Financial (SIVB) and Signature Bank (SBNY) via a joint statement released Sunday night by the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. This included the Fed sharing it "will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors."</p>
	    <p>Our view is this action is a Band-Aid approach to reassure depositors in order to prevent a repeat of what we saw late last week, but the fallout to come likely will see banks becoming more disciplined with their loan programs. This could pressure early-stage companies that are contending with the tech downturn, but it could also jump-start merger-and-acquisition activity in the coming months.</p>
	    <p>Given the speed with which this unfolded and the impact that Silicon Valley Bank had on the market -- with its $212 billion in total assets, $74 billion in total loans and $342 billion in total client funds as more than 2,500 venture capital firms banked with it and 15% of its loans were secured by residential mortgages and commercial real estate -- odds are there will be ripple effects. And there will still be questions over similar exposures at banks and other institutions tied to the venture debt market. That is going to raise questions about bank profitability, and indeed we are seeing some of those questions emerge today.</p>	
	    <p>We are also seeing the market question the Fed's next steps when it comes to monetary policy and its fight against inflation. Following the weekend's developments, the CME FedWatch Tool tells us the odds of a 50-basis-point move by the Fed next week is off the table, but we are still likely to see a 25-basis-point move. Without any fresh inflation data since Friday's February Employment Report, it's fair to say the market is thinking the Fed will factor the happenings of the last few days into its thinking.</p>	
	    <p>We are seeing a mixed outlook in equity futures this morning, with those for Nasdaq moving higher while the ones for the Dow Industrials and S&P 500 are bouncing back and forth between slightly up and modestly down. The yield for the 10-Year Treasury is also moving lower, hitting 3.515%, pretty much back to where it was in early February. What is climbing this morning, is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which is up double-digits to levels we haven't seen since late. October. This move along with the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index that fell sharply to Extreme Fear from Neutral over the last week suggests the next few days are likely to be volatile and potentially emotional for some investors.</p>
      <p>The next few days bring not only the February Consumer Price Index report as well as Wednesday's February Producer Price Index report but also the February Retail Sales report. If tomorrow's CPI data is more in line with the Cleveland Fed's Inflation Nowcasting model that calls for headline CPI to come in at 6.2% in February with the core reading up 5.5%, showing little progress against January's respective readings of 6.4% and 5.6%, we could see the market react negatively as it once again rethinks what the Fed is likely to do next week. The key to is remember the Fed's dual mandate - stable prices and maximum employment. </p>
      <p>What this all means is the market will continue to trade day to day based on what is learned that day. Only once we get through the coming days will we have more answers that will tell us what is likely to happen. For now, we will sit on the sidelines, letting our cash, inverse ETFs and the position in gold via the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) fulfill their role in the portfolio. As we noted in Friday's Roundup, there are several holdings that have been hit, putting them back at more than interesting price levels. However, given a potential for the market to whipsaw in the coming days, we will bide our time for at least a bit longer.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, we would note that this Friday we have a triple witching event with the expiration of stock options, stock index futures and stock index options. This happens roughly four times a year and has been known to produce strong swings in the market. As we move toward that and digest the week's data we will also be closely watching the technical levels for the S&P 500 we shared earlier this morning. </p>

      <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell Monday, while Nasdaq futures rose after a flurry of news Sunday evening. The FDIC and other financial regulators announced that all SVB Financial depositors would get access to all funds Monday, while also announcing a plan to limit the contagion. Regulators also closed embattled Signature Bank (SBNY).</p>
      <p>Treasury yields plummeted while Fed rate hike odds faded, but bank stocks continued to sell off, including such as First Republic Bank (FRC), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) as regulators stressed their would be no bailouts for shareholders.</p>
      <p>President Biden will speaking on the banking crisis at 9 a.m. ET.</p>
      <p>First Republic stock crashed more than 60% Monday morning, even after saying it got fresh funding from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan. Western Alliance also is off over 60% as well. Schwab lost 6% despite a Citigroup upgrade. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which found support on Friday, fell 1% even with a Wells Fargo upgrade. Bank of America (BAC) retreated 3%. The XLF financial ETF fell modestly and KRE regional bank ETF declined sharply.</p>
      <p>The stock market suffered big losses last week as SVB Financial (SIVB) and crypto bank Silvergate Financial (SI) collapsed, triggering intense losses for bank stocks. The major indexes sold off hard, breaking multiple areas of support during the week as many leading stocks also came under pressure.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
      <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.7% after surging more than 1% Sunday night. S&P 500 futures sank 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.%. Futures are active and volatile.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield, which dived last week on safe-haven flows, tumbled 21 basis points to 3.48%. But the 2-year Treasury yield plunged 50 basis points to 4.9%, as Fed rate hike odds fall.</p>
	    <p>Markets are now pricing in just one quarter-point rate hike, with a solid chance that the Fed will pause on March 22. A few days ago, markets expected 50 basis points on March 22, with at least two more quarter-point hikes after that.</p>
	    <p>Crude oil futures plunged 5%.</p>	
	    <p>Bitcoin rose sharply Sunday and largely held those gains Monday morning. The cryptocurrency tumbled last week on the Silvergate and SVB collapses.</p>
      <p>In other news, Pfizer (PFE) will buy Seagen (SGEN) for $229 a share, with an enterprise value of $43 billion, following weeks of talks. PFE stock fell modestly while SGEN stock leapt nearly 20%. Sanofi (SNY) will acquire Provention Bio (PRVB) for $2.9 billion, or $25 a share. SNY stock was little changed while PRVB stock more than tripled.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <p>The video embedded in this article discussed the market action in depth while also analyzing JPMorgan Chase, Palo Alto Networks and META stock.</p>
      <p><strong>FDIC, Regulators Protect SVB Financial Depositors</strong></p>
      <p>Shortly after Dow futures opened, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Reserve issued a joint statement that SVB Financial's "[d]epositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13." They also announced that Signature Bank, which had a lot of crypto exposure, would be closed due to systemic risks. Signature Bank's depositors also will be protected.</p>
      <p>California regulators shut down SVB Financial and its Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary on Friday, the largest bank failure since Washington Mutual in the 2008 financial crisis.</p>	
      <p>The FDIC held an auction over the weekend for Silicon Valley Bank, with final bids due Sunday afternoon, according to multiple reports. No winner has been announced.</p>
	    <p>HSBC Holdings (HSBC) will buy SVB's U.K. arm for just over $1.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Fed is creating a new financial backstop for other banks. The facility will offer loans of up to one year to banks and other institutions. They'll have to pledge high-quality collateral such as Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Notably, that collateral will be valued at par, not mark to market. Banks have been sitting on unrealized debt losses as Fed rate hikes sent rates soaring over the past year. That was a big facto in SVB Financial's collapse.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of companies, including many venture capital and tech startups, have deposits or business ties to Silicon Valley Bank. There were reports that many will struggle to meet payroll without access to accounts soon.</p>
      <p>Notably, SVB and SBNY shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected.</p>
      <p>Stocks Near Buy Points</p>
      <p>Amid a weak, volatile, uncertain market, investors should not be making new position trades and instead be largely or entirely in cash. But keep an eye on stocks holding up near buy points. Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and United Airlines (UAL) are five stocks showing strength, near buy points. PANW stock has formed a handle on a long consolidation, while META stock has a new flat base. ULTA stock is finding support at key levels. Monolithic Power is working on a long cup-with-handle base while UAL stock has retreated from a buy zone.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has a new flat base as well. Tesla (TSLA) sold off hard this past week, but did find support at its 10-week line on Friday. TSLA stock is far from being actionable. Wolfe Research downgraded Tesla to peer perform on Monday, saying the SVB collapse adds to macro pressures.</p>
      <p>Insulet (PODD) will replace SIVB stock in the S&P 500 before Wednesday's open. PODD stock jumped Friday night.</p>
      <p>PANW stock is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist. MPWR stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders watchlist. Monolithic Power, United Airlines and ULTA stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.</p>
      <p><strong>Stock Market Weekly Action</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market started off higher but quickly reversed lower for major losses on Fed rate hike fears and later the SVB Financial and Silvergate shutdowns.</p>
      <p>Twice on Friday, stocks bounced as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed confidence in a "resilient" banking system. But the positive momentum quickly faded.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4.4% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index sold off 4.55%. The Nasdaq composite skidded 4.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 dived 8%.</p>
      <p>Apple stock fell just 1.7% for the week to 148.50, holding above its 200-day line. But that's after reversing from Monday's intraday high of 156.30, nearly hitting AAPL's 157.48 buy point.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield plunged 29 basis points to 3.69% this past week, after hitting a 2023 high of 4.09% on March 2. The 2-year yield tumbled 27 basis points to 4.59%, including 31 basis points on Friday and 48 points on Thursday-Friday.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell 3.8% to $76.68 a barrel this past week, but did rise on Friday.</p>
      <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) plunged just over 6% last week, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) slumped 3.4%.  The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gave up 5.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 3%, with MPWR stock an SMH holding.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) dived 10.9% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 11.4%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. TSLA fell 12.3% for the week, amid fresh price cuts and safety probes. But shares edged up on Friday.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) sold off 11.1% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 7.1%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 4.8, with UAL stock a key component. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 4.85%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) gave up 5.3%.  The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) slumped 3.85% to the lowest point since October.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dived 8.5%, with JPMorgan and SCHW stock big holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) plummeted 15.7%, its worst weekly loss since the Covid crash in March 2020. SIVB stock and Western Alliance are notable components.</p>
      <p><strong>Market Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market suffered damaging losses this past week, with the major indexes selling off hard and breaking through multiple support levels. The indexes tried to bounce back from early losses Friday, briefly turning positive, before tumbling to fresh lows.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 tumbled through their 21-day lines early in the week and finished decisively below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 finished Friday below the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones is at its worst levels since early November.</p>
      <p>Fed chief Jerome Powell's signal that he favors "faster" rate hikes hit the market on Tuesday-Wednesday. But SVB Financial and crypto bank Silvergate Capital rocked banks late in the week.</p>
      <p>A Friday morning rebound attempt fizzled as the FDIC announced SVB Financial's failure.</p>
      <p>If bank contagion fears grow, that would be grim for Wall Street and the economy. However, if SVB Financial's woes are seen as isolated and broader banking fears quickly fade, that could restore overall market confidence. But that would also likely send Treasury yields and the dollar rebounding higher, with Fed rate hike odds also increasing.</p>
      <p>The odds of a half-point Fed rate hike surged from 30% on Monday to over 80% following Fed chief Powell's testimony, then fell back below 40% on Friday. The odds fell further over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Leading stocks also sold off hard last week. A number of names held up for much of the week, but most of those were struggling by Friday's close.</p>
      <p>Up until Thursday, Friday's jobs report and the upcoming March 14 CPI inflation report seemed like major events. And they are still important. A relatively tame CPI inflation rate could give Fed chief Powell and his colleagues the excuse they need to raise rates by only a quarter-point.</p>
      <p>But in the very near term, Wall Street will likely take its cue from the banking sector. So pay attention to banks, from the biggest recent losers such as First Republic to broad ETFs and relative stalwarts such as JPM stock.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan was the S&P 500's second-best stock on Friday, even as SBNY stock, First Republic and Schwab were the worst performers. That's a sign that investors see JPMorgan as relatively safe. But if JPM stock breaks this past week's lows, that would be concerning.</p>
      <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market is selling off hard amid bad news and even-greater uncertainty.</p>
      <p>This is not a healthy environment. Investors should be largely or entirely on the sidelines, waiting to see how this shakes out. If conditions clear up in a few days or weeks, new buying opportunities will arise.</p>
      <p>Build your watchlists with a focus on the stocks showing strong relative strength. If they're near potential buy points like META stock, Monolithic Power or Palo Alto, great. But that's not the priority right now.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether led a strong price rebound in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies in morning trading in Asia as U.S. banking regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, both with ties to the crypto industry, and guaranteed deposits at the institutions as well as additional backstops for the banking industry. The moves followed the failure of Silvergate Capital last week that raised the threat of a systemic run on banks. Solana led the gains.</p>
	    <h3><strong>Fast facts</strong></h3>
	    <ul><li>Bitcoin jumped 9.60% in the past 24 hours to US$22,601 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether gained 9.77% to US$1,621.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Solana surged 12.85% to US$20.38 to lead the gainers, but still has more ground to make up as it’s down 2.93% over the past seven days.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization, traded back in line with its U.S. dollar peg in the Asia Monday morning after briefly losing the peg following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank where it holds about US$3 billion in deposits, according to Circle, the issuer of USDC.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>USDC fell to US$0.8774 on Saturday and its market cap slumped 15% to US$36 billion from US$43 billion. Circle said the same day the company had the funds to back USDC and it would remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. dollar. USDC recently traded at US$0.9941.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Monday that all Circle deposits will be available when banks open on Monday.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The total crypto market capitalization rose 6.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.01 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours was down 34.52% to US$60.19 billion.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>U.S. equities slid on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.07%, the S&P 500 fell 1.45% and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.76%.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The slump in equities followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by the FDIC on Friday, in the biggest U.S. bank failure since 2008. However, U.S. stock futures were trading higher on Monday morning in Asia, reflecting the moves to backstop the U.S. banking industry.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Amid the banking scares, investors had to contend with the job report from the Labor Department on Friday that showed February nonfarm payrolls came in at  311,000, beating the projected 225,000. This furthers the narrative that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates more than previously expected to curb inflation.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>However, with banking failures now the center of attention and concern, analysts at the CME Group predict a 17.4% chance of a 50 basis point hike this month, a sharp drop from 60.9% last Friday. This reflects a view the Fed is unlikely to raise rates by that much in the middle of a series of bank failures.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>CME expect a 82.6% chance the Fed will raise rates by the forecasted 25 basis points this month, but other commentators say the Fed may postpone any hike until next month because of the banking industry jitters.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The Fed meets on March 22 to make its next decision on interest rates, which are currently between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The U.S. annual inflation rate is 6.4% for the year ended January 2023, according to Labor Department data released on Feb. 14, which is well above the Fed’s long-term goal to keep inflation in a 2% band. The next inflation update is scheduled for March 14 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.</li></ul>

      <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices fell $2 in volatile trading on Monday as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank hit equities markets and raised fears of a fresh financial crisis, but a recovery in Chinese demand provided support.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures were down $2.03, or 2.5%, to $80.75 per barrel by 1401 GMT. West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell $2.11, or 2.8%, to $74.57 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Brent earlier in the session hit lows last seen in early January while WTI touched prices last reached in early December.</p>
	    <p>Fears of contagion from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to a sell-off in U.S. assets at the end of last week, while state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank on Sunday.</p>
	    <p>Europe's STOXX bank index was down 5.8%, having shed 3.8% on Friday. U.S. authorities launched emergency measures on Sunday to shore up confidence in the banking system.</p>	
	    <p>"Investor sentiment towards these sectors will be hit in the near term. The crisis indicates that there continues to be sizeable risks in financial markets", said Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners.</p>	
	    <p>"Interest rates have moved a long way in a short space of time, exposing weaknesses across the global financial system."</p>
      <p>Market sentiment was already fragile as worries about further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve have been exacerbated by high U.S. crude oil inventories.</p>
      <p>In recent days a weaker dollar, which makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies, has lent some support to prices.</p>
      <p>Oil's fall follows positive momentum on Friday, when U.S. employment data surprised to the upside. Data for February beat expectations, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 311,000, compared with expectations of a gain of 205,000 in a Reuters survey.</p>
      <p>From a medium- to long-term supply perspective, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co on Friday said U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a fourth week in a row for the first time since July 2020.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- China’s efforts to ramp up lithium extraction could see it accounting for nearly a third of the world’s supply by the middle of the decade, according to UBS AG.</p>
      <p>The bank expects Chinese-controlled mines, including projects in Africa, to raise output to 705,000 tons by 2025, from 194,000 tons in 2022. That would lift China’s share of the mineral critical to electric-vehicle batteries to 32% of global supply, from 24% last year, according to a note on Friday.</p>
    	<p>The race to secure lithium is playing out at the highest levels, with nations including the US prioritizing access to the materials necessary for making batteries as the world turns away from fossil fuels. China’s needs are particularly acute because it’s home to the world’s biggest market for new energy vehicles.</p>
	    <p>The rise in Chinese output will include an increase in material derived from lepidolite, a lithium-bearing rock often overlooked as poor quality and environmentally unsound because of its low yield and high energy costs. UBS sees lepidolite in China accounting for 280,000 tons of lithium in 2025, or 13% of global supply, from 88,000 tons last year, as the government continues to support the sector.</p>	
	    <p>Beijing has already moved to curb unlicensed lepidolite extraction in Jiangxi province, a major mining hub, as it seeks to exert more control over its deposits.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The second-largest stablecoin in crypto fell from its intended $1 peg on Saturday, trading as low as 81.5 cents, hurt by the exposure of issuer Circle Internet Financial Ltd. to the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
      <p>USD Coin, or USDC, is a key plank of crypto markets and is supposed to hold a constant $1 value, fully backed by reserves of cash and short-dated Treasuries. But $3.3 billion of that roughly $40 billion stockpile is with Silicon Valley Bank, which has just become one of the largest US bank failures in recent history.</p>
      <p>Regulators seized the bank on Friday and investors are awaiting more clarity on the return of deposits. In that vacuum, USDC fell below $1, trading at about 92 cents as of 9:02 a.m. in London on Saturday. Smaller stablecoins such as DAI and Pax Dollar also fell from their pegs, a sign of wider nervousness.</p>  
      <p>The worries haven’t so far spread to top stablecoin Tether, which held at $1. Tether has previously faced scrutiny over its reserves. Wider crypto markets are having a painful week and were on the back foot Saturday: Bitcoin oscillated between gains and losses, while smaller tokens like Solana and Avalanche were in the red.</p>  
      <p>Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte described the fall of Silicon Valley Bank as a “black swan failure” in the US financial system, saying in a tweet that without a federal rescue plan there would be “broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs.”</p>
      <p>USDC has a circulating supply of about 41 billion tokens and a market value of roughly $37 billion, CoinGecko data shows. A net $2 billion of USDC was redeemed in the past 24 hours, according to blockchain research firm Nansen. Data compiled by Bloomberg indicated USDC traded as low as 81.5 cents.</p>
      <p>Coinbase’s Step</p>
      <p>Stablecoins like USDC are intended to hold a set value against another, highly liquid asset like the US dollar. They come in a variety of forms and some, like Circle’s, are underpinned by reserves of cash and bonds. Investors often park funds in stablecoins as they move between crypto trades.</p>
      <p>As the selloff in USDC worsened, US-based crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. said it would be “temporarily pausing” the conversion of USDC into US dollars during the weekend, and would resume on Monday when banks open.</p>
      <p>The fall in USDC has had a knock-on effect on decentralized finance applications which let users trade, borrow and lend coins and which tend to rely heavily on trading pairs involving the stablecoin.</p>
      <p>“Unless there’s a concrete bailout plan this weekend, I think markets will be ugly again next week,” said Teong Hng, chief executive officer at crypto investment firm Satori Research, about the failure of SVB.</p>
      <p>Crypto’s Woes</p>
      <p>The crypto sector was already reeling from a prolonged rout that’s knocked $2 trillion off the value of digital assets since November 2021, precipitating a series of implosions such as the TerraUSD stablecoin, the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund and the FTX exchange.</p>
      <p>The TerraUSD token — known as UST — tried to use a mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving a sister token, Luna, to hold its value. The $60 billion wipeout of that system intensified global regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins.</p>
      <p>“I think the market ‘panic priced’ USDC like it priced USDT around the Luna collapse,” said Haohan Xu, chief executive officer of Apifiny, an institutional trading platform. “It’s driven by Circle’s exposure at SVB plus Coinbase closing off its USDC convert function.”</p>
      <p>Trying to Reassure</p>
      <p>Crypto firms including Binance and Tether on Friday used Twitter to try to reassure their customers about any risks posed by the failed bank.</p>
      <p>Changpeng Zhao, chief executive officer at Binance, the largest digital-asset exchange, tweeted that the firm doesn’t have exposure and its funds are safe.</p>
      <p>Paxos Trust Co., issuer of Pax Dollar, and crypto exchange Gemini said they have no relationship with the bank, according to statements on their official Twitter accounts. Tether’s Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in a tweet that the largest stablecoin doesn’t have exposure to SVB.</p>
      <p>By contrast, bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi has about $227 million in an account at the failed bank, according to a court filing.</p>

      <p>By Elizabeth Howcroft and RISHABH JAISWAL</p>
      <p>LONDON (Reuters) -Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) lost its dollar peg and slumped to an all-time low on Saturday before recovering most of its losses after Circle, the firm behind it, assured investors it would honor the peg despite exposure to failed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
      <p>Circle said in a tweet on Friday it has $3.3 billion of its $40 billion of USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank. On Saturday, the cryptocurrency company said in a blog post that USDC liquidity operations will resume as normal when banks open on Monday morning in the United States.</p>
      <p>"As a regulated payment token, USDC will remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar", the company said in a blog post.</p> 
      <p>The cryptocurrency firm said that in the event the bank does not return 100% of deposits, it will cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.</p>  
      <p>The coin, which broke its 1:1 dollar peg and fell as low as $0.88 shortly after 0800 GMT (3 a.m. EST) on Saturday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, recovered to trade around $0.97 by 2100 GMT.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on Friday in the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, roiling global markets and stranding billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors.</p>
      <p>Circle said in a tweet on Friday that the company and USDC "continue to operate normally" while the firm waits for clarity on what will happen to Silicon Valley Bank depositors.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase said in a tweet it was not allowing USDC to be exchanged for U.S. dollars over the weekend while banks are closed, citing "heightened activity", while it plans to resume swaps on Monday.</p>
      <p>Joseph Edwards, investment advisor at Enigma Securities, said the situation was "extremely serious" for USDC.</p>
      <p>"No matter how sound Circle's operations are, this sort of depeg on a stablecoin tends to fundamentally undermine confidence in it," Edwards said.</p>
      <p>"The short-term implications here are dramatic and unknowable, especially once systems start to have to be adjusted to the reality that 1 USDC isn't trading at 1 USD for the time being."</p>
      <p>CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE</p>
      <p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a constant exchange rate with "fiat" currencies - those backed by a central government rather than a physical commodity such as gold - for example through a 1:1 U.S. dollar peg.</p>
      <p>Used in cryptocurrency trading, they have surged in value in recent years. USDC is the second-biggest stablecoin with a market cap of $37 billion. The largest, Tether, has a market cap of $72 billion, according to CoinGecko.</p>
      <p>USDC's price usually holds close to $1, making Saturday's drop unprecedented. According to CoinGecko data, its previous all-time low was around $0.97 in 2018, though in 2022 it fell just below $0.99 when cryptocurrency markets were roiled by the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.</p>
      <p>Traders have been on guard this week for signs of contagion in the financial sector and beyond from troubles for Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-focused Silvergate, which this week disclosed plans to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate.</p>
      <p>Boston-based Circle said last week it had moved a "small percentage" of USDC reserve deposits held at Silvergate to its other banking partners.</p>
      <p>The chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet on Friday it had no exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, as did Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin issuer Paxos and crypto exchange Gemini also tweeted that they do not have relationships with the bank.</p>

      <p>Coinbase (COIN) hit the brakes on conversions between USDC stablecoin and US dollars late Friday as fallout from Silicon Valley Bank's (SIVB) collapse spread into the heart of crypto trading.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, the crypto exchange said it was "temporarily pausing" the conversions while banks are closed over the weekend. The exchange said it planned to restart conversions on Monday.</p>
      <p>The pause speaks to the chaos that's roiled the crypto industry's second-largest stablecoin in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's demise on Friday. Speculating on the stability of USDC, traders redeemed $1.6 billion of USDC, lowering its total supply.</p>
      <p>Late in the day, Circle confirmed that $3.3B of the $40B backing its stablecoin was on deposit at the now-shuttered lender. The fate of that cash is now uncertain, with Silicon Valley Bank having been seized by the FDIC, and USDC – for the moment – has lost its dollar peg.</p>  
      <p>"Circle is currently protecting USDC from a black swan failure in the U.S. banking system," tweeted Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte late Friday night. "Silicon Valley Bank is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure – without a Federal rescue plan – will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs."</p> 
      <p>"During periods of heightened activity, conversions rely on USD transfers from the banks that clear during normal banking hours," Coinbase said in its tweet announcing the conversion pause. "When banks open on Monday, we plan to re-commence conversions."</p>

      <p>A 33% plunge in the previously high-flying Nasdaq Composite is the perfect time for growth investors to pounce on some amazing deals.</p>
      <p>While I hate being the bearer of bad news, stock market corrections are a perfectly normal part of the investing cycle. Since the beginning of 1950, the benchmark S&P 500 has undergone 39 separate double-digit percentage corrections, according to data from sell-side consultancy firm Yardeni Research. In other words, the drubbing Wall Street took in 2022 is par for the course when investing for the long run.</p>
      <p>When the major indexes crossed the finish line last year, it was the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) that was hit hardest. The Nasdaq, which led the broader market to new highs in 2021, shed 33% of its value in 2022 and continues to stew in a bear market.</p>
      <p>But there's a silver lining in this bad news. Though we'll never be able to forecast exactly when a bear market will occur or how steep the decline will be, we do know that every previous bear market in the major U.S. stock indexes (including the Nasdaq) was eventually whisked away by a bull market. It effectively means that every bear market is the ideal time to put your money to work.</p>
      <p>It's an especially lucrative time to go shopping for growth stocks. What follows are five stunning growth stocks you'll regret not buying on the Nasdaq bear market dip.</p>
      <p><strong>Nio</strong></p>
      <p>The first phenomenal growth stock just begging to be bought during the bear market decline is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO). Although supply chain issues continue to weigh on Nio's production expansion efforts, a number of headwinds have been safely put in the back seat.</p>
      <p>For the past couple of years, China stocks carried extra investment risk due to the country's zero-COVID strategy, as well as the possible delisting of China stocks by U.S. regulators. However, China has abandoned its zero-COVID strategy and reopened its economy. What's more, regulators gained hold of three years' worth of financial audits for Chinese firms, which removes the fear of delisting. In short, Nio is considerably de-risked from where things stood four months ago.</p>
      <p>But what's really been impressive about this company is its various forms of innovation. Nio has been introducing at least one new EV each year and has seen sales of its ET7 and ET5 sedans take off since hitting showrooms last year. With the exception of January, when production was constrained by factory closures as a result of the Chinese New Year, Nio has delivered in excess of 10,000 EVs every month since June 2022, with its sedans regularly accounting for more than half of those deliveries.</p>
      <p>Nio's out-of-the-box innovation is on display as well. In August 2020, the company announced the rollout of its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription. BaaS allows its EV buyers to charge, swap, and upgrade batteries at more than 1,300 power swap stations and more than 1,200 power charger stations. In exchange for a reduced EV purchase price, Nio nets high-margin, recurring subscription revenue from buyers via BaaS and keeps buyers loyal to the brand.</p>
      <p><strong>Exelixis</strong></p>
      <p>The second amazing growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is biotech stock Exelixis (EXEL). Despite occasional clinical trial failures, cancer-drug developer Exelixis is well positioned to grow by double digits.</p>
      <p>A little over a week ago, Exelixis announced that a late-stage study involving its blockbuster drug Cabometyx in combination with Roche's Tecentriq failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in a trial for patients with previously treated advanced kidney cancer.  But failures happen. It's part of being a drug developer.</p>
	    <p>What's far more important is that Exelixis has around six dozen clinical trials ongoing involving Cabometyx as a monotherapy or combination treatment for a variety of cancer types. It only takes a handful of success stories to significantly expand Cabometyx's sales and pricing power. We've already witnessed one of these studies finding the mark, which led to Exelixis and Bristol Myers Squibb gaining first-line approval for their combination treatment for renal cell carcinoma.</p>
	    <p>Furthermore, Exelixis has the cash to fund ongoing internal development, collaborations, and possibly even acquisitions. The company closed out 2022 with approximately $1.31 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and had another $756.7 million in long-term investments. </p>	
	    <p><strong>Walt Disney</strong></p>	
	    <p>A third stunning growth stock you'll regret not adding during the Nasdaq bear market drop is the popular "House of Mouse," Walt Disney (DIS). Though Walt Disney is a mature business, it's expected to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate for the next half-decade. That absolutely makes it a growth stock.</p>
      <p>The biggest competitive edge that Disney offers is that its business can't be duplicated. While there are other theme parks consumers can visit and other movies on the big screen, Disney's characters and stories, along with the emotion, engagement, and imagination they evoke in consumers, can't be duplicated by any other company.</p>
      <p>As I've previously suggested, the value of this irreplaceability can be seen in Walt Disney's pricing power. Since Disneyland opened its doors in Southern California in 1955, admission prices have risen by 10,300%. By comparison, the U.S. inflation rate has jumped a little over 1,000% over the same time span.  Disney has also been able to raise prices on its ad-free streaming service, Disney+, while losing only a small fraction of its subscribers. </p>
      <p>The next step in Walt Disney's evolution is turning its money-losing streaming segment into a profit machine. Newly reappointed CEO Bob Iger increased monthly subscription prices and is targeting profitability for this segment toward the end of fiscal 2024. Once streaming becomes cash-flow positive, I'd be surprised to see Disney stock anywhere near $100 per share.</p>
      <p><strong>Innovative Industrial Properties</strong></p>
      <p>The fourth magnificent growth stock that you'll regret not scooping up during the Nasdaq's bear market swoon is marijuana-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). In spite of rent-collection speed bumps in recent months, IIP, as Innovative Industrial Properties is known, can show patient investors the green.</p>
      <p>The prevailing concern with IIP is that its on-time rental collection rate has dropped from 100% to 92% as of the end of February 2023. But it's important to understand that all REITs eventually deal with delinquencies. It's how companies handle their delinquencies that matters. IIP's fourth-quarter report and year-to-date update shows it's working through these delinquencies and should be able to sustain these revenue streams or outright sell these properties for cash.</p>
      <p>Another key point with Innovative Industrial Properties is that 100% of its properties are triple-net leased (also known as "NNN leased"). NNN-leased properties require the tenant to cover all expenses, including utilities, maintenance, and even property tax and insurance. While NNN leases reduce the rental income IIP can expect to receive, it also removes any chance of surprise expenses or inflation hurting the company.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Innovative Industrial Properties might be one of the few pot stocks benefiting from weed remaining illegal at the federal level. Since most cannabis companies have limited access to basic financial services, IIP has been able to work out sale-leaseback agreements that benefit both parties. Cultivators and processors get cash they sorely need from IIP, and IIP lands long-term tenants through this program.</p>
      <p><strong>Alphabet</strong></p>
      <p>A fifth stunning growth stock that you'll regret not buying during the Nasdaq bear market dip is Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, autonomous vehicle company Waymo, and streaming platform YouTube.</p>
      <p>At the moment, advertising weakness is Alphabet's biggest headwind. When the probability of a recession materializing rises, advertisers pull back on their spending. But this is also a two-sided coin. Even though recessions are inevitable, they're typically short-lived. Buying ad-driven stocks during these short swoons often allows investors to take advantage of long-winded economic expansions.</p>
      <p>Alphabet's competitive advantage isn't going away anytime soon, either. Since December 2018, data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for roughly 91% to 93% of global internet search share. Having a 90-percentage-point lead over its next-closest competitor allows Google to command significant pricing power for ad placement.</p>
      <p>Alphabet's ancillary operating segments provide plenty of promise, too. YouTube is the second most visited social platform in the world, with Shorts getting more than 50 billion daily views. Meanwhile, Google Cloud has worked its way up to a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure-service spending. </p>
      <p>Based on both forward-year earnings and future cash flow, Alphabet is cheaper now than at any point since it became a publicly traded company.</p>

      <p>US stocks sank Friday, with a losing week capped by the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis and the prospect of higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 was on the verge of losing its 2023 gain as it finished closer to 3,839.50, where it ended after last year's 19% plunge. The index's financial sector was the worst performing on Friday as regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank to prevent a run on the tech-startups lender. The bank collapsed after this week saying higher interest rates spurred billions in losses on a $21 billion bond portfolio.</p> 
      <p>"Silicon Valley Bank was heavily reliant on the tech industry, catering mainly to startups and the investors that fund them. However, the insular ecosystem of startups and investors that it served took a hit when the Fed began raising rates to curb inflation," Thomas Smale, CEO of FEI International, wrote Friday.</p>

      <p>Stocks had moved higher ahead of the opening bell after investors found some relief in the February jobs report.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department said the US economy added 311,000 jobs last month, much higher than expectations of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. But wage growth slowed to 0.2% from January's 0.5% pace, curbing expectations the Federal Reserve will upsize its March interest rate hike to 50 basis points.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Government-bond yields fell the most since since 2008 after a US bank failure spurred traders to reassess the outlook for additional Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Shorter-dated Treasury yields plummeted for a second day as traders reverted to pricing in a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s March 21-22 meeting, instead of a half-point move. The market also resumed pricing in a quarter-point cut by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The moves occurred even as US employment data released Friday showed job creation exceeded estimates for an 11th straight month in February, which prompted economists at Barclays Plc to forecast a half-point hike in March. The mixed data, which also showed wages rose less than expected, was overshadowed by the failure of SVB Financial Group, which buckled under the strain of declining deposits and losses on its securities portfolio.</p>
      <p>The two-year Treasury yield fell nearly 30 basis points to 4.57% at one point and ended near its session low. The yield’s two-day slide of just under 50 basis points was the biggest since 2008. Investors also piled into German short-term debt, sending those rates into a similarly steep decline.</p>
      <p>“It is incredible to see the whipsaw action in Treasury yields and it’s likely people want to own Treasuries into the weekend,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed-income strategy at Wisdom Tree Investments.</p>
      <p>Traders reasoned that the prospect of contagion in the banking system could curb the Fed’s willingness to keep raising rates despite still-elevated inflation. Swaps referencing the March meeting price in about 32 basis points of tightening, down some 13 basis points from earlier in the week. A rate cut by year end from the expected peak level had dwindled to less than a coin-toss in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>“The reaction in the market reflects the broader worry about US banks and investors did expect a beat in the payrolls number,” said Andrzej Skiba, portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management.</p>
      <p>Markets are jittery about potential fallout from the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, which has suffered losses on a portfolio including US Treasuries. Investors are turning their attention to risks that may lurk in other financial institutions — and questioning the degree to which the Fed’s rate hikes have precipitated that pain.</p>
      <p>US payrolls in February rose by more than expected while a broad measure of monthly wage growth slowed, offering a mixed picture as the Fed contemplates whether to step up the pace of rate hikes. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6% as the labor force grew, and monthly wages rose at the slowest pace in a year. Nonfarm payrolls increased 311,000 after a 504,000 advance in January, revised down from 517,000.</p> 
      <p>Traders will look to whether next week’s release of US consumer inflation data warrants pricing in a quarter- or half-point hike this month.</p> 
      <p>“The market is clearly reading that the labor report is solid but not strong enough for the Fed to re-accelerate the hiking cycle,” said Roberto Cobo Garcia, BBVA’s head of G10 FX strategy. “It would probably take very significant surprises in the CPI data next week for the Fed to change course again.”</p>

      <p>British Pound vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</p>
      <p>The British pound initially plunged during the week to show signs of weakness, reaching down to the 1.1850 level again. This is an area that previously had been support, so the fact that we held there is a good sign. However, it’s also worth noting that we have seen a lot of choppy and noisy behavior as of late, and most of this reaction was due to the Non-Farm Payroll announcement on Friday, perhaps showing a little bit of hesitation in wage pressure. With that in mind, I’m a little less likely to get bullish of the British pound that I would be under normal circumstances, especially as the preceding candlesticks were all inverted hammers.</p>
      <p>I do believe eventually the British pound falls apart, and goes looking to lower pricing against the US dollar, but right now we might be settling on some type of short-term consolidation. If that’s going to be the case, keep in mind that markets can be extraordinarily choppy at times and you need to be cautious with your position size as a result.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the weekly candlestick, then I think it opens up a move down to the 1.15 level, something that I do expect to happen sooner or later. With that, I would be increasingly aggressive to the downside. If we do rally from here, I think there’s a lot of noise near the 1.21 level and the 1.2250 level where the 50-Week EMA currently resides. Either way, volatility is going to be a major issue.</p>

      <p>Euro vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</p>
      <p>The Euro has initially fallen during the week, only to turn around to show signs of life again. The 50-Week EMA seems to be attracting a lot of attention, so therefore it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have turned around. Furthermore, we also had the non-Farm Payroll announcement come out on Friday that had people hoping that perhaps the shrinking wage inflation might have the Federal Reserve rethinking its rate of change. That of course is absolute nonsense, but in the short term it seems to be that’s the narrative that Wall Street is playing.</p>
      <p>If we can break higher, there should be a significant amount of resistance near the 1.07 level, and then again at the 1.08 level. On the downside, if we were to break down below the bottom of the candlesticks for the past couple of weeks, then I think you have a situation where you could easily see this market drop down to the 1.03 level, followed by parity. Keep in mind that parity is going to attract a lot of headlines, and therefore people will be very interested in that region. I think we will have a major fight if we do get down to that area, and whether or not we can break down below there is a completely open question at this point.</p>
      <p>At this juncture, I think the only thing you can probably count on is going to be more volatility, which is something that quite frankly I think a lot of traders are sick of. However, until we get some type of certainty when it comes to trading conditions and the economic outlook, this is a beast that we have to deal with.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin,the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 10.98% in the week from March 3 to March 10, to trade at US$19,941 at 9:00 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether slid 10.88% in the same period to US$1,397.</p>
      <p>The crypto market saw a turbulent week after New York State Attorney General Letitia James said Ether should be registered as a security in her lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin filed on Thursday, a day after crypto-friendly financial institution Silvergate Capital said it would cease operations and liquidate its banking unit.</p>
      <p>Investors digested hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said that the U.S. central bank may continue to raise interest rates this year to combat inflation.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin is still highly dependent on the monetary policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and any words hinting an increase or decrease of the key rate can have an effect on its price,” wrote Roman Nekrasov, co-founder of blockchain software firm Encry, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>  
      <p>“The depreciation of Bitcoin should not be unexpected since inflation in the U.S. and the rest of the world has not gone away. The growth of Bitcoin in January and February was expected to stop and turn into a correction. Therefore, Bitcoin was expected to move into a downtrend,” wrote Nekrasov.</p> 
      <p>The Fed will announce its rate decision at the Federal Open Market Committee’s March 21-22 meeting.</p>
      <p>Alexander Politayko, the founder of MarsDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization developing deflationary products, said that he believes Bitcoin’s main support level is US$18,000.</p>
      <p>“If Bitcoin does not hold on to this level, then the market may witness another wave of panic sales, and Bitcoin could return to the levels of last fall at US$16,000,” wrote Politayko in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, data from investment platform MacroMicro suggests that more Bitcoin owners are deciding against selling their assets despite turbulent market conditions. The percentage of Bitcoin supply that has been dormant for at least a year rose to an all-time high of 67.84% last weekend.</p>
      <p>“There is a growing number of investors who view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but also as a store of value or tool for savings. This is significant because it indicates a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a purely speculative asset to one that has a practical use case,” wrote Politayko.</p>
      <p>“As more people begin to use Bitcoin for its utilitarian value, the demand for the asset as a means to store value is likely to increase. This, in turn, can affect the price of Bitcoin in a positive way,” he added.</p>
      <p>The global crypto market capitalization stood at US$923 billion on Friday at 9:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, falling 10.3% from US$1.03 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$385 billion market cap dominated 41.6% of the market, while Ether’s US$170 billion accounted for 18.5%.</p>
      <p><strong>Kava tops winners</strong></p>
      <p>Kava, the governance token of a layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Kava rose 7.18% to US$0.86, and surpassed Solana in the total value of assets locked in the network this week, according to DeFiLlama data.</p>
      <p>STX, the native token of Bitcoin smart contract layer Stacks, was the week’s worst performer among CoinMarketCap’s top 100, as it fell 33.54% to US$0.54. MINA, the token of privacy-focused blockchain Mina Protocol, followed closely as it fell 30.89% to US$0.61.</p>
      <p><strong>Next week?</strong></p>
      <p>Investors will be anticipating the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index data, a key indicator for inflation.</p>
      <p>In addition, the European Union will likely announce a 50 basis point rate hike next week, as predicted by 60 economists polled by Reuters. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the rate hike is “very, very likely.” The central bank’s interest rate is expected to rise to 3.00% as a result.</p>
      <p>The banking industry is bracing for ongoing challenges as the drop of Silicon Valley Bank’s shares, plunging over 60% on Thursday, prompted a domino effect, causing the market value of the four biggest U.S. banks to plummet by more than US$50 billion, raising widespread anxieties in equity markets.</p>

      <p>Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell slightly early Friday, while Nasdaq futures were little changed ahead of the February jobs report. SVB Financial kept plunging overnight after triggering a bank stock sell-off that slammed the broad market Thursday. Treasury yields kept falling.</p>
      <p>Oracle (ORCL) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reported earnings late.</p>
      <p>The stock market rally reversed sharply lower Thursday as questions about banks' financials suddenly came to the fore. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell to critical support levels.</p> 
      <p>Bank stocks plunged as SVB Financial (SIVB), parent of Silicon Valley Bank, cratered on a series of negative headlines while long-ailing crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) said it would shut down. Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) were among the high-profile losers.</p> 
      <p>SIVB stock continued to plunge late as fears of a bank run grew.</p>
      <p>Investors should be cautious, waiting for the market rally to show renewed strength.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Earnings</strong></p>
      <p>ORCL stock fell 5% overnight after Oracle earnings topped but revenue fell short. Oracle stock skidded 5.9% to 81.75 on Thursday, falling below its 50-day line. Shares have been working on a 91.32 buy point from a deep cup-with-handle base.</p>
      <p>ULTA stock edged lower in premarket action. Ulta Beauty earnings and revenue topped views, but same-store guidance was light. The beauty products retail giant dipped 0.8% to 519.93 on Thursday, just below its 21-day line. ULTA stock does not have a clear buy point.</p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p>Jobs Report</p>
      <p>The Labor Department will release the February jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect to see nonfarm payrolls up by 223,000, a big slowdown from January's 517,000, but that would still be a strong two-month start to the year. The jobless rate should hold at a 53-year low of 3.4%. Average hourly earnings should climb 0.3%, but the annual pay gain should pick up to 4.7%.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Labor reported initial jobless claims rose more than expected to their highest number since December. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that announced layoff plans are the highest to start a year since 2009.</p>
      <p>The February jobs report, along with next week's CPI inflation report, could lock in expectations for half-point rate hike on March 22.</p>
      <p><strong>Dow Jones Futures Today</strong></p>
      <p>Dow Jones futures fell 0.4% vs. fair value, but off overnight lows. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures were flat.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield sank 11 basis points to 3.83%. The 2-year yield slumped 11 basis points to 4.79%.</p>
      <p>Crude oil futures fell 1%.</p>
      <p>The February jobs report will be sure to swing Dow Jones futures, Treasury yields and Fed rate hike expectations.</p>
      <p>Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.</p>
      <p><strong>Stock Market Rally</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market rally got off to a decent start Thursday on rising jobless claims, but soon reversed lower on bank concerns. The major indexes steadily worsened, closing near session lows.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index tumbled 1.85%, with SIVB stock, First Republic Bank (FRC) and Schwab the biggest losers. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.05%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has a lot of financial components, plunged 2.8%.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.2% to $75.72 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 3.92%. The two-year Treasury yield plunged 16 basis points to 4.9%, while the six-month T-bill yield dipped 3 basis points to 5.28%.</p>
      <p>Fed rate hike expectations have shifted, but not decisively.</p>
      <p>As of early Friday, Markets see a 62% chance of a 50-basis-point move on March 22, down from Thursday's 68.3% and Wednesday's 78.6%. The odds spiked from around 30% before Fed chief Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony on Tuesday. Markets are now pricing in 75 basis points of rate hikes over the next three Fed meetings, with another quarter-point increase likely over that time.</p>
      <p><strong>Bank Stocks</strong></p>
      <p>SIVB stock plummeted 60% to 106.04, the lowest price since 2016. SVB Financial late Wednesday announced a $1.75 billion share sale. The Silicon Valley Bank parent also cut guidance. Deposits are dwindling due to startups facing a funding drought. There are also big concerns about SVB's loans to the tech industry.</p>
      <p>SIVB stock plunged over 60% in heavy premarket trade Friday. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is advising companies to pull money from Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported. SVB Financial still has to price that share offering.</p>
      <p>Silvergate Capital, which has been in free-fall for months, announced late Wednesday that it would shut down, with its Silvergate Bank liquidating. SI stock dived 42% on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The SVB and Silvergate news slammed financials, already under pressure as the extremely inverted yield curve upends the traditional borrow short/lend long lending strategy.</p>
      <p>KeyCorp (KEY), which warned on net interest margins earlier in the week, slumped 7.2% Thursday. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) tumbled nearly 13%, and FRC stock dived 16.5%.</p>
      <p>JPM stock skidded 5.4%. On Tuesday, JPMorgan fell below a 138.76 buy point and its 50-day line. BAC stock retreated 6.2% to its lowest levels since October. WFC stock also lost 6.2%, tumbling below its 200-day line after breaking below its 50-day earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>SCHW stock plunged 12.8%, gapping below the 200-day line and the low of its base. JPMorgan offered a block sale of 8.5 million Schwab shares, Bloomberg reported. SCHW stock is at its worst levels since October.</p>
      <p>On Friday, banking giants were little changed or edged lower after big losses Thursday and for the week. But FRC stock sold off again, with Western Alliance and KeyCorp also down</p>
      <p>Investors will take a much-closer look at banks' balance sheets and capital levels, something that hasn't been a real concern up until now. Banks are pushing up deposit and CD rates significantly, while long-term rates lag. Many banks are sitting on sizable unrealized losses on loans and other securities.</p>
      <p>If banks rein in lending, that could rapidly chill the economy. Meanwhile, SVB Financial and Silvergate Capital's woes raise concerns about their tech and crypto clienteles.</p>
      <p><strong>ETFs</strong></p>
      <p>Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) tumbled 3.1%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slumped 2.3%, with ORCL stock a big IGV component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) gave up 1.9%.</p>
      <p>Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 4.2% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 3.8%.</p>
      <p>SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) shed 2.6% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) 2.2%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) descended 3.1%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped down 1.6%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) retreated 1.4% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) 1%.</p>
      <p>The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) plunged 4.1%, with JPM stock, Wells Fargo, Charles Schwab and Bank of America all notable holdings. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dived 8.2% to a three-year low. SIVB stock is a notable KRE holding, along with KeyCorp and Western Alliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Market Rally Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The stock market rally had a highly negative day, with a downside reversal damaging the major indexes and leading stocks.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 opened by rising above its 50-day line, but soon hit resistance at the 21-day moving average and reversed lower to below its 200-day line and its March 2 low.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq initially rose above its 21-day line, but then reversed to below the 200-day line. The tech-heavy composite briefly undercut its 50-day before settling just above that level.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones knifed below its 200-day line to a four-month low.</p>
      <p>The Russell 2000 fell decisively below its 50-day line, all the way to its 200-day line.</p>
      <p>Some leaders held up, but most did not.</p>
      <p>Banking concerns triggered by SIVB stock, Silvergate and KeyCorp don't mean a financial crisis is on the way. Banks, especially the giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, are far-better capitalized than they were in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. But the fact that the words "financial crisis" are even being mentioned is a big shift.</p>
      <p>If banks rein in lending aggressively, that would hit the broader economy quickly. That also would raise the already-hefty risk that the Federal Reserve will overshoot rate hikes, triggering a hard landing. That also could spur the Fed to be more cautious with rate hikes.</p>
      <p>Friday's jobs report will be important, but it's the market reaction that matters. Keep in mind that if the economy suddenly stalls, lagging employment data won't offer a warning.</p>
      <p><strong>What To Do Now</strong></p>
      <p>With the S&P 500 and other major indexes heading south once again, it's not a time to add exposure. Investors should be looking to cut losses on recent buys that are struggling.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the market rally will once again find support with a tame jobs report or upcoming inflation data, but hope isn't a strategy. The key indexes are on the cusp of breaking decisively lower.</p>
      <p>On the upside, wait for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to retake their 21-day lines. If that happens, new buying opportunities will emerge. So keep working on those watchlists.</p>

      <p>Silvergate served the cryptocurrency industry, while SVB was the bank for Silicon Valley tech startups.</p>
      <p>It's a black week for the American financial system: In just 48 hours, the banking sector has been shaken by the collapse of two major banks.</p>
      <p>Most worrying is that these banks served two so-called growth economic sectors: the tech sector and the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
      <p>SVB Financial Group,  (SIVB) - Get Free Report the lender to Silicon Valley startups, failed on March 10, falling into the hands of the FDIC. The federal agency has taken control of the banking company, reviving the ghosts of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>"Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed today by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver," the federal agency said in a news release.</p>
      <p>"All insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, March 13, 2023. The FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week. Uninsured depositors will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds."</p>
      <p>It added that it may pay a dividend to uninsured depositors as it sells the assets of SVB</p>
      <p>The FDIC is a guarantor for bank depositors.</p>
      <p><strong>SVB: The To-Go Bank for Tech Startups</strong></p>
      <p>At the end of last year SVB had $209 billion in total assets and $175 billion in total deposits. SVB becomes the second biggest failure of a U.S. bank after Washington Mutual in 2008.</p>
      <p>SVB was a central player in the innovation economy. It was the backbone of the tech industry in Silicon Valley. It played an important role in the startup ecosystem by providing specialized financial services, industry expertise, a valuable network, and a strong reputation.</p>
      <p>It also offered a range of financial services tailored specifically to the needs of startups, such as venture debt, corporate banking, and asset management. These services are designed to help startups manage their finances, optimize their cash flow, and scale their businesses.</p>
      <p>SVB suffered from the rise in interest rates from the Federal Reserve because it hurt the value of its investment assets, especially bonds. As a result, the bank had to resort to a capital raise as many startups withdrew their deposits from the bank since they were burning a lot of cash.</p>
      <p>SVB had to sell bonds, primarily U.S. Treasury securities, at a discount to cover these withdrawals. The rise in interest rates has made existing bonds less valuable. In selling these bond positions, SVB had to take a significant loss.</p>
      <p>But its attempt to raise $2.25 billion failed.</p>
      <p><strong>Crypto Bank Silvergate Collapsed</strong></p>  
      <p>Two days earlier, Silvergate, the crypto bank, collapsed. The bank was where most of the big crypto firms went, because traditional banks did not want to do business with them. And that reluctance stemmed from warnings from regulators who consider the crypto industry a risky sector.</p>
      <p>The company said on March 8 that it intended "to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate the bank in an orderly manner and in accordance with applicable regulatory processes."</p>
      <p>It added: "In light of recent industry and regulatory developments, Silvergate believes that an orderly wind down of bank operations and a voluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward."</p>  
      <p>"The bank’s wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits. The Company is also considering how best to resolve claims and preserve the residual value of its assets, including its proprietary technology and tax assets."</p>
      <p><strong>Verging on Bigger Fall Than 2008: Economist Schiff</strong></p>
      <p>The rout of the La Jolla, Calif., bank was due to pressure from regulators, in particular the Department of Justice, which has opened an investigation into its business relations with the empire of the former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
      <p>Bankman-Fried has been charged with 12 counts of fraud, stemming from the collapse of his crypto empire, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research.</p>
      <p>Silvergate was established in 1988. The bank initially specialized in lending to industrial customers and at the time also offered loans for both residential and commercial real estate.</p>
      <p>But in 2013, the bank began to court crypto firms, when traditional banks were reluctant to do so due to the opacity prevailing in the sector. Silvergate thus became the crypto bank. </p>
      <p>In 2019, the firm made its initial public offering, promising a complete refocus on the industry, which was then experiencing a renaissance. As of Sept. 30, Silvergate had $11.9 billion in digital assets held as deposits. </p>
      <p>But the bankruptcy of FTX and Alameda on Nov. 11 scared away customers. The bank thus reported only $3.8 billion in digital assets held as deposits as of Dec. 31. FTX was one of Silvergate's big customers.</p>
      <p>The question now is whether other U.S. banks will fall? Could SVB and Silvergate's issues spread to other regional banks especially since suspicion can lead customers to rush to these banks to withdraw their money?</p>
      <p>"The U.S. banking system is on the verge of a much bigger collapse than 2008," said economist Peter Schiff, known for his dire predictions. </p>
      <p>"Banks own long-term paper at extremely low interest rates. They can't compete with short-term Treasuries. Mass withdrawals from depositors seeking higher yields will result in a wave of bank failures."</p>

      <p>TAIPEI (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc.'s Google said on Wednesday it will launch a T$300 million ($9.8 million) fund over the next three years to help boost the Taiwanese media's continuing operations and digital competitiveness.</p>
      <p>Google has come under pressure in some countries to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, though not in Taiwan.Google said it will pay local publishers through what it calls a "Taiwan News Digital Co-prosperity Fund" to strengthen their digital publishing capability.</p>
      <p>The fund will help Taiwan local media "hone digital skills, gain expertise and support the sustainable development of Taiwan's news industry", the company said. "Even while Google faces many challenges in the overall international environment, Taiwan remains a crucial global stronghold," Tina Lin, managing director of sales and operations at Google Taiwan, told reporters in Taipei. Google said Taiwan's media industry has been facing major competitive challenges in adapting to the digital age, pointing out that advertising revenues for traditional media outlets have dropped 70% from 2003 to 2020. The initiative marks the latest effort by the internet giant to develop mechanisms to support and compensate regional news providers whose content appears on Google, as it faces the prospect that governments may impose regulations to require such mechanisms.</p>  
      <p>An Australian law giving the government power to compel Google and rival Meta Platforms to negotiate content supply deals with media outlets has largely worked, according to an Australian government report in late 2022.</p>

      <p>Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?</p>
  <p><strong>Why Does Debt Bring Risk?</strong></p>
  <p>Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.</p> 
  <p><strong>What Is Amazon.com's Net Debt?</strong></p>  
  <p>The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2022 Amazon.com had debt of US$85.1b, up from US$57.7b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$70.0b, its net debt is less, at about US$15.1b.</p>
  <p><strong>How Strong Is Amazon.com's Balance Sheet?</strong></p>
  <p>The latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$155.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.2b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$70.0b in cash and US$42.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$204.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.</p>
  <p>While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amazon.com has a huge market capitalization of US$958.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.</p>
  <p>We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.</p>
  <p>With net debt sitting at just 0.28 times EBITDA, Amazon.com is arguably pretty conservatively geared. And it boasts interest cover of 8.9 times, which is more than adequate. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Amazon.com if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 51% cut to EBIT over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.</p>
  <p>Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amazon.com recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.</p>
  <p><strong>Our View</strong></p>
  <p>While Amazon.com's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow makes us cautious about it, its track record of (not) growing its EBIT is no better. But at least its net debt to EBITDA is a gleaming silver lining to those clouds. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think Amazon.com's debt poses some risks to the business. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. While Amazon.com didn't make a statutory profit in the last year, its positive EBIT suggests that profitability might not be far away.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.</p>

    content: <div className="blog-content">
      <p>Meta's rival to ChatGPT has been leaked online and is now available for download. Yahoo Finance investigates how much it differs from Microsoft and Google's AI alternatives.</p>
      <p>In February, Meta (META) unveiled LLaMA, their memorably-named Large Language Model competitor to Microsoft's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.</p>
      <p>At the time Mark Zuckerberg's tech-firm stated that they would only give researchers access to the artificial intelligence application, so as to "maintain integrity and prevent misuse".</p>  
      <p>Meta's initial release statement said: "To maintain integrity and prevent misuse, we are releasing our model under a noncommercial license focused on research use cases, and access to the model will be granted on a case-by-case basis to academic researchers."</p>  
      <p>However, someone has now leaked Facebook/Meta's Large Language Model alternative to the public via fringe online messaging platform 4Chan.</p>
      <p>After the leak, developers have taken the new chat-bot app out for a test drive, so what do we know so far?</p>
      <p>So far Meta's offering in the AI gold-rush to create the ultimate 'automated companion' for our journeys throughout cyber-space is similar in style to ChatGPT and Bard, with an ability to generate human-like responses to prompts and questions.</p>
      <p>According to popular AI newsletter The Neuron, "early testers are saying that LLaMA isn't as good as the models powering ChatGPT.</p>
      <p>"That's mostly because ChatGPT has anchored people to chat, and LLaMA wasn't taught how."</p>
      <p>On machine learning platform Hugging Face, one developer inquired, "anyone know how to get going with LLaMA?"</p>
      <p>Another platform released the code for LLaMA, on the popular website Github. Where developers had quickly used Meta's code to introduce 'ChatLLaMA', which was described as having a training process that was 15 times faster than ChatGPT.</p>
      <p>After the leak was detected Meta sent a takedown notice to Hugging Face, citing legal issues.</p>
      <p>Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun has also claimed that although LLaMA is a smaller AI model that uses less parameters than rivals it will be just as powerful, if not more, than other leading language models.</p>
      <p>Rivals ChatGPT and Google's Bard are trained following the scaling law, which attests that the more parameters the model has access to, the better the result.</p>
      <p>However, a paper released last month by Meta artificial intelligence researchers claimed that "although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of performance, a smaller one trained longer will ultimately be cheaper at inference".</p>
      <p>Within artificial intelligence technology, 'inference' explains how an AI model can use the data that it has been trained on to understand new information that it has never been exposed to before. In application, this gives the AI the ability to make decisions and evolve its understanding when fed fresh data.</p>
      <p>According to AI news outlet The De-Coder, Meta's alternative to ChatGPT "is more compact and faster and is even said to be on par with Google’s PaLM-E model".</p>
      <p>Google's PaLM-E combines language, speech and robotics, but has not yet been released.</p>
      <p><strong></strong></p>
      <p>What are Large Language Models?</p>
      <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured mass media headlines across the globe since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November, which has received investment from Microsoft (MSFT) to the tune of $10bn (£8.3bn).</p>
      <p>ChatGPT now has over 100 million users, the fastest application to mass adoption on record, and Microsoft has stated that the new technology will operate as a user's 'co-pilot' as they navigate the web.</p>
      <p>Large Language Models allow 'artificial intelligence' to generate content on request via a trawl of large data sets, in a matter of seconds.</p>
      <p>These generative-AI tools can produce haiku, jokes, corporate emails, business plans, fix computer code, write academic essays and even pieces of original fiction in the style of any writer you want, from Joyce and Dostoyevsky, to Shakespeare.</p>
      <p>Microsoft and Google (GOOG) are competing to build the best models to boost their search engines.</p>

      <p>In this article, we will discuss the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks. If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Most Profitable Renewable Energy Stocks.</p>
      <p>There has been a global energy crisis since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. European countries realized they heavily relied on Russian natural gas and crude oil and needed to transition away from these sources to reduce their dependence. During the conflict, the price of crude oil and natural gas spiked significantly due to global uncertainty, and the importance of oil and gas supply took center stage in the political landscape. As a result, there has been an acceleration in the installation of renewable energy resources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the capacity growth of renewable energy is set to double in the next five years. During this process, renewable energy sources will overtake coal and become the biggest energy source for the generation of electricity.</p>
      <p>The IEA anticipates the capacity of renewable energy to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) during the 2022 to 2027 period. The increase in the capacity growth of renewable energy is 30% higher than the forecast one year ago. This reflects the positive intent of governments around the world on transforming towards renewable energy sources. The IEA also notes that 90% of the increase in electricity capacity globally will be done through renewable sources, and as a result, renewable energy will become the biggest source of electricity generation by early 2025. IEA Director Fatih Birol shared that in the next five years, the world will add as much renewable energy as in the last two decades.</p> 
      <p>Besides Europe, India, China, and the US are also aggressively pursuing the rollout of renewable energy at various levels. The 14th Five-Year Plan rolled out by China in January 2022 focuses on making China a behemoth in the field of renewable energy, as the country will be responsible for nearly 50% of new capacity additions through renewable energy during the 2022 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 in the US intends to provide long-term support to the aggressive expansion and adoption of renewable energy by various corporations. Meanwhile, India is also set to increase its investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion between 2022 to 2027. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) are some of the most profitable renewable energy stocks in the industry currently.</p> 
      <p>A thorough research was conducted on the renewable energy sector, including its current market trends, growth projections, and key players, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and identify the most promising companies within it. We then shortlisted the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks on the basis of their trailing 12 months’ net income.

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell in afternoon trading in Asia on Wednesday, with XRP the sole gainer among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The new Forkast NFT 500 index slipped, and Asian equity markets were mixed following declines in the U.S. as investors reacted to Tuesday’s comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin fell 0.76% to US$22,028 in 24 hours as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down over 7% on the week. Ether fell 1% to US$1,554, after losing about 6% in the past seven days.</li>
        <li>XRP was the day’s biggest gainer, extending gains from Tuesday. The token increased 2.42% to US$0.38 but declined 1.25% on the week.</li>
        <li>Altcoin Bone ShibaSwap was the top gainer of all cryptocurrencies, rising over 10% over 24 hours to trade hands at US$1.69.</li>
        <li>The global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 1.82% to US$1.01 trillion, but the total crypto market volume increased 41.44% to US$46.71 billion in the last 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Asian stocks were mostly flat despite losses in the U.S. after hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised the possibility of the U.S. central bank returning to significant rate hikes to settle inflation. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng saw the biggest loss of 2.35% while Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.48%.</li>
        <li>Investors remained cautious after Powell’s hawkish remarks. European stocks were trading flat, as Germany’s DAX 40 inched down 0.02%, while the STOXX 600 slid 0.17%.</li>

      <h3>KEY POINTS</h3>
      <ul><li>Amazon ads are the most effective and cheapest way to advertise online, making their ads more attractive for brands versus competitors.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The ad business is likely already its most profitable and valuable segment.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>The best thesis for investing in this stock as the economy normalizes over the next year or two is its prowess in digital advertising.</li></ul>
      <p><strong>This technology conglomerate is building a sizable profitable ad business capable of challenging Meta's family of apps and Google's advertising empire</strong></p>  
      <p>It turns out that even mighty Amazon (AMZN 0.40%) is not immune to the adverse effects of inflation and rising interest rates. For example, its quarterly revenue growth rates for its North American and International e-commerce segments peaked in the first quarter of 2021. Even worse, both e-commerce businesses turned in an unprofitable fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
      <p>As for Amazon Web Services (AWS), revenue has consistently decelerated over the last several years amid intensifying competition and the law of large numbers, which states that the larger a company grows, the more difficult it is to achieve prior growth rates.</p>
      <p>For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2018, AWS grew revenue at 45% year over year, and in the fourth quarter of 2022, the cloud unit only produced 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Additionally, operating income for AWS dropped 2% year over year during the latest fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Since Amazon's primary growth engines offered investors little to be excited about since the first quarter of 2021, investors became fascinated with the growth potential of Amazon's nascent digital advertising business. However, since Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google ad business and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) family of app businesses, including Facebook, dominated the online advertising industry for about a decade, the question is whether Amazon's advertising business is worth investors' attention as a possible long-term growth engine.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look.</p>
      <p><storng>Its advertising unit is taking share</storng></p>
      <p>According to an article by Axios, which cited statistics from Insider Intelligence, Google and Meta combined in 2022 for a less than 50% market share for the first time in eight years. These statistics show that both companies are losing market share, and the prime cause is Amazon, which ended 2022 with a 7.3% digital ad market share. Still, analysts project its share to explode to nearly 13% by 2024, closing the gap with Meta's projected 17.9% share -- a drop from the 19.6% market share Meta achieved in 2022.</p>
      <p>Many advertisers are gravitating to Amazon ads since it's the most effective and cheapest way to advertise online.</p>
      <p>According to a Feedvisor report that cites a 2020 survey of over 1,000 brands, 36% of all brands say Amazon generates the highest return on media spend, followed by paid social at 29% and then Google at 27%. Even better, 59% of the brands on Amazon's e-commerce marketplace say that it drives the highest return on media spending, followed by Google at 22% and then paid social at 17%.</p>
      <p>As far as cost, according to a report from e-commerce analytics firm Sellics, Amazon ads are 68% cheaper than Google, 44% cheaper than Facebook, 79% cheaper than Instagram, and 13% cheaper than e-commerce competitor Walmart (NYSE: WMT).</p>
      <p><strong>Why investors are interested in its ad unit</strong></p>
      <p>While Alphabet's advertising unit and Meta's advertising lost approximately 4% year over year in revenue in the fourth quarter, Amazon's ad unit generated 19% year over year, despite an ad market that global media company Magna Global forecasts to slow further during 2023. And only the 20% revenue growth of the AWS segment was better for it in the fourth quarter. However, the prime rationale behind the investors' strong interest in the ad segment is that it is likely the most profitable piece of its business.</p>
      <p>While the company does not reveal the profitability of its ad business, analysts have roughly figured the profitability that Amazon gains in advertising by comparing it to Google and Meta's advertising units' profitability and using a few assumptions. Most analysts conclude that Amazon's advertising unit is more profitable than AWS.</p>
      <p>In addition, AWS also requires substantial capital investment, long-term investments in property, equipment, land, computers, and software needed to operate the cloud business. In its fourth-quarter 2021 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky revealed for the first time that just under 40% of its capital expenses go toward supporting AWS.</p>
      <p>Suppose that is true; in 2022, $25 billion of capital expenditures went into supporting AWS, while AWS only produced $22.84 billion in operating income in the same year. Amazon likely uses all of the AWS segment's operating income to pay the cloud unit's capital expenses. Thus AWS currently has a feeble free cash flow. And if you assume advertising is a less capital-intensive business, it produces better free cash flow than AWS.</p>
      <p>So however you want to parse it, advertising is a rapidly growing, profitable growth engine for Amazon that might already be its most valuable business.</p>
      <p><strong>A foggy short-term future</strong></p>
      <p>Amazon shareholders should understand that a recession would not benefit any of its businesses, including advertising, which relies substantially on the health of its e-commerce markets.</p>
      <p>Suppose you want to invest in Amazon stock for its long-term potential in advertising. Be aware that things could get much worse before getting better, and the ad business won't ride in to save the day.</p>
      <p>Still, as the economy normalizes over the next year or two, the ad business will likely become its most significant growth engine and a strong thesis for becoming a shareholder.</p>

  <h3>Key Points</h3>
  <ul><li>Alphabet has been beaten down, with shares trading 40% below their highs.</li></ul>
  <ul><li>The company has a dominant and profitable core business, as well as some big potential growth drivers.</li></ul>
  <ul><li>With massive financial flexibility and an attractive valuation, Alphabet is worth a closer look.</li></ul>
  <p><strong>This dominant industry leader still has lots of growth potential.</strong></p>
  <p>There's a solid argument to be made for most of the FAANG stocks right now. Just to name a couple examples, Amazon trades for less than half of its recent peak, and Netflix recently reported subscriber numbers that were dramatically better than analysts were expecting.</p>
  <p>However, as we head into spring, there is one FAANG stock that looks like a particularly strong long-term opportunity while interest rates and inflation remain elevated and economic uncertainty persists: Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 0.42%) (GOOG 0.51%). The company offers a rare combination of maturity, profitability, and growth potential, and with shares down by about 40% from their highs, it looks like a bargain for patient investors.</p>
  <p><strong>A core business with maturity and growth potential</strong></p>
  <p>Roughly 90% of Alphabet's revenue comes from Google Services, and to be fair, this is a collection of relatively mature, ad-driven businesses. The dominant Google Search platform is the biggest component, but this also includes YouTube, Gmail, Android, Chrome, Maps, and other popular consumer-facing platforms.</p>
  <p>There could still be significant growth potential on this side of the business, but it's not likely to happen in the years ahead. However, Google Services is a collection of rock-solid dominant businesses that produces a reliable stream of high-margin revenue.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Google Cloud, which currently accounts for about 10% of the company's revenue, could be a major growth driver in the years to come. It provides business collaboration tools, cloud storage, database services, content delivery networks (CDN), artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, app platforms, and much more. In all, Google Cloud offers more than 150 different products.</p>
  <p>For the time being, Google Cloud is a relatively small part of the business, but that could change in the coming years. For one thing, Cloud is the fastest-growing part of the company, with revenue increasing 32% year over year in the fourth quarter. It is the only one of the big three cloud providers to gain significant share of the cloud infrastructure market in recent quarters (Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure are the leaders).</p>
  <p>Not only that, but the cloud market itself is expanding rapidly. The cloud computing market was estimated at $484 billion in size in 2022, but is expected to more than triple by 2030 to a $1.55 trillion opportunity. If Google Cloud can increase its market share, this could end up being a big growth driver.</p>
  <p><strong>Lots of optionality</strong></p>
  <p>There are a few other reasons Alphabet is my favorite FAANG stock right now. The "other bets" segment doesn't produce much revenue currently, but that could potentially change in the future. The Waymo self-driving vehicle start-up is especially promising, but there are also some start-ups in healthcare and artificial intelligence, among other industries. To be clear, I'd buy Alphabet even if nothing ever came of these businesses -- but it's a nice addition to the tech titan's future potential. And it also doesn't limit the company's acquisition potential to just organizations that fit into the Google Services and Cloud segments.</p>
  <p>Finally, it's important to consider Alphabet's stellar financial condition. The company has about $140 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet, which gives it tremendous financial flexibility, especially when you consider it generated nearly $60 billion in net income over past four quarters alone. Alphabet can fund acquisition opportunities, reinvest in innovation, or opportunistically buy back shares as it sees fit.</p>
  <p><strong>Should you add Alphabet to your portfolio before the second half of 2023?</strong></p>
  <p>At some point, inflation will decline back toward historic levels and the Federal Reserve will back off of its interest rate increases, which could be an excellent catalyst for industries like advertising. More economic certainty would likely translate into more ad spending across the core Google Services businesses and would also make enterprise customers more comfortable increasing their spending on cloud services. So while I think Alphabet makes an excellent long-term investment regardless of timing, it could be an especially opportunistic buy while the stock is still about 40% below its highs due to the current economic uncertainty.</p>

      <p>By Jonathan Stempel</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc has resumed its purchases of Occidental Petroleum Corp shares after a five-month hiatus, increasing its stake in the oil company to about 22.2%, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Berkshire paid about $355 million for 5.8 million Occidental shares between March 3 and March 7, according to the filing.</p>  
      <p>The purchases were the first Berkshire has disclosed since late September. It ended last year with a 21.4% stake.</p>  
      <p>In August, Berkshire won U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission to buy up to 50% of Occidental's common stock.</p>
      <p>Buffett's company now owns about 200.2 million Occidental shares worth $12.2 billion, based on Tuesday's closing price of $60.85.</p>
      <p>Those shares would generate about $144 million of annual dividends, following a 38% increase that Occidental announced last month.</p>
      <p>Berkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock that throws off $800 million of annual dividends, plus warrants to buy another $5 billion of common stock.</p>
      <p>Occidental ended January with about 900 million shares outstanding.</p>
      <p>Berkshire began buying large quantities of the Houston-based company's stock about one year ago.</p>
      <p>After its stake surpassed 20%, Berkshire adopted the equity method of accounting for its holdings, and now reports its share of Occidental's results with its own.</p>
      <p>Accounting rules normally require the equity method above the 20% threshold, reflecting an assumption that the holder might exert significant influence.</p>
      <p>Berkshire ended 2022 with $128.6 billion of cash and equivalents. It plans to keep a $30 billion cushion.</p>
      <p>Occidental's share price more than doubled in 2022, benefiting from higher oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Though fourth-quarter profit was lower than analysts expected, Occidental said it planned to raise capital spending this year and could repurchase up to $3 billion of stock.</p>
      <p>Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, consumer brands such as Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom, and other stocks including Apple Inc.</p>

      <p>Alphabet (GOOGL) closed the most recent trading day at $93.86, moving -1.34% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's 1.53% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.72%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 3.27%.</p>
      <p>Coming into today, shares of the internet search leader had lost 7.55% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.34%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.28%.</p>
      <p>Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Alphabet as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $1.09 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 11.38%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $56.89 billion, up 1.56% from the year-ago period.</p> 
      <p>Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.12 per share and revenue of $246.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.28% and +5.48%, respectively, from last year.</p> 
      <p>Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.</p>
      <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.61% lower. Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Digging into valuation, Alphabet currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.58. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 25.2, which means Alphabet is trading at a discount to the group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, GOOGL's PEG ratio is currently 1.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.36 as of yesterday's close.</p>
      <p>The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 64, putting it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to grade how tech sector leaders performed this past earnings season amid labor trends, A.I. adoption, and TikTok facing legislative headwinds.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Meta planning another round of layoffs this week, that's according to reports from Bloomberg. Now, the move would add thousands more to the 11,000 workers that were cut from the social media giant last November. It is the latest in a tech industry that has certainly seen a massive contraction over the last several months.</p>
      <p>Here to break down how the major players are navigating this and who's coming out on top, Yahoo Finance's tech reporter Allie Garfinkle has that for us. Hey, Allie.</p> 
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Seana. So while I'm not a teacher, I want to break this down report card style because these companies are all in incredibly different positions. I want to start with Apple, who is at the top of the pack with an A. Now, Apple's earnings were actually not standard Apple. We actually saw a rare miss out of them this last cycle.</p> 
      <p>However, there's a key number that's really important here for how things are looking, and it's 2 billion devices. That is how big their install base is. I believe that's more than 20% of the world's population. So the iPhone install base is at an all-time high, and it's sending the company's services revenue to a record of $20.8 billion.</p>
      <p>What does this-- what does this all amount to? It says that analysts say that this bodes extremely well for Apple's future as they increase how much individual users spend. So not a standard quarter for Apple, but there is a lot of good news there. So we'll give them an A. Maybe we'll fudge it to an A-minus.</p>
      <p>Now, next is Microsoft. So Microsoft will get a B, slight top line B, slight bottom line miss, but they won the ChatGPT lottery. Now, while their cloud growth is slowing, it slowed to about 31%, just barely beating analysts' expectations, that $10 billion investment in ChatGPT came at exactly the right moment. So we're going to give them a B for foresight.</p>
      <p>Next, Amazon. Revenue beat, earned EPS miss. Amazon has a lot to prove here. They're really doubling down on cost cutting, and I'm giving them a C because of that cloud number. Amazon Web Services net sales came in missing. It was a $21.3 billion actual versus $21.76 billion expected.</p>
      <p>Now, that doesn't seem like a big miss. And to be fair, it is not. However, that has been a stalwart-- AWS has been a stalwart of Apple-- of Apple-- of Amazon's business for so long, that it is very important that they keep that growth up or come up with a new plan.</p>
      <p>And last, we have Meta, which is going to get a C. Yes, they beat key revenue expectations, and there are growing losses on the Reality Labs operation, hence the C. However, they are investing in a $40 billion stock buyback plan, and they're betting that this year of efficiency, this cost-cutting plan, is going to work. I'm withholding judgment for now, but they are certainly ready to bet on themselves.</p>
      <p>Of course, now Meta being in the news because they're reportedly set to do another round of layoffs that could affect thousands and could come as early as this week. That said, Meta is the only one we know is doing layoffs for the time being. However, given Jerome Powell's testimony earlier today that rates will continue rising, the macroeconomic climate that has been so difficult for so many of these companies will continue to be difficult, so we'll have to see how they navigate it moving forward.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: Very good. So, Allie, you mentioned the ChatGPT lottery being won by Microsoft. Let's shift to the other one, which is the TikTok ban boost, if you will. Who stands to benefit the most? Because you're young and I'm old and because you're our tech reporter, is it YouTube Shorts, therefore Google? Is it Meta with their Reels? Or is it even Snap, who's seen a really solid pop to start the year? Who's the closest to emulating it in terms of social media style?</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: That is a really good question, Dave, and I'll be candid. I think there are a couple of different answers, and we would have to have that whole scenario play out to really know who the winner is. That said, I'm going to actually throw my hat in on Snap here. Every analyst I've ever spoken to who's bullish on Snap has one key argument, and it's that it is essential for teenagers. And if that's like something TikTok has become known for, it's certainly something Snap is known for, definitely on Wall Street and, to be fair, among the teenagers I've talked to.</p>
      <p>So I'd say if there's anyone who's set to really benefit, I would put money on Snap. That said, YouTube Shorts is something Google has massively invested in. Meta has been preparing for the moment where, hopefully, TikTok is less of a competitor for a long time. I think we could see a massive shift in the competitive landscape. But I would say the biggest beneficiary could be Snap, and the market certainly seems to think so.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: That's an interesting take because I sat at a Celtics game with a 15-year-old the other day, and he was on Snap the entire time, not TikTok.</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: The kids love it.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: So, yeah--</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: The kids love it.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: --they really do. I'm curious--</p>
      <p>ALLIE GARFINKLE: They love it.</p>
      <p>DAVID BRIGGS: --to see where they go from here. Allie Garfinkle, thanks so much. Good stuff.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gains to show signs of hesitation. At this point, it looks like we are trying to build up enough pressure to go lower, breaking down below the support. The market has continued to fail every time we get close to the 50-Day EMA, so it is more likely going to continue to be a situation where traders are fading the rally, taking advantage of US dollar strength.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA is also backed up by the 200-Day EMA, so therefore I think there are quite a few different players that look to short this market every time it tries to rally. Ultimately, this is a situation where if we can break down below the 1.1850 level underneath, then the market is likely to drop down to the 1.15 level underneath. The 1.15 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we have seen a lot of noise previously. That previous resistance should now end up being supported.</p>  
      <p>On the other hand, if we turned around and took out the 200-Day EMA, then it’s likely that we could go to the 1.23 level. After that, then we have the 1.25 level above, that is where we have the double top, which started at the 1.24 level. Ultimately, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, but I also believe that this is a market that has a major overhang, and therefore it’s going to be difficult for it to go much higher.</p> 
      <p>Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is going to remain tighter for longer when it comes to the monetary policy, and therefore it’s likely that we would see the US dollar continue to be strong in general. All things being equal, this is a situation where we continue to see a lot of downward pressure on each rally, and therefore I will be fading each one at the first signs of exhaustion. True, support has held fairly well so far, but it is only a matter of time before it gives way to all of this mounting pressure.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro initially tried to rally during the trading session on Tuesday but gave back gains near the 1.07 level. The 1.07 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and an area where we have seen both support and resistance recently. That being said, the market also has been banging around between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which typically will mean that we have a lot of noise out there that is going to continue to be a problem.</p>
      <p>If we were to turn around and break down below the 200-Day EMA, which is basically at the 1.05 level, then it opens up a trap door to much lower prices, perhaps down to the 1.03 level, followed by the parity level. The parity level of course is an area that will attract a lot of attention due to the fact that it is a level that makes for a good headline number. However, I think at this point we’ve got a situation where we have so much in the way of noise and volatility out there that sooner or later the Euro starts to fall. After all, when you look at the chart you can see that we had fallen rather drastically from the 1.10 level. The last couple of weeks have been very noisy, but it’s also worth noting that it was kicked off by a massive shot lower.</p> 
      <p>Jerome Powell is speaking during the session, in front of the United States Congress. That could be a mover of markets, but we will have to wait and see. Either way, it looks as if the sellers are going to continue to take hold of this market, especially as we sold off so drastically from the 50% Fibonacci level of the massive selloff that occurred last year. I think we continue to see more of the same, and therefore I think it’s only a matter of time before we go lower. That being said, if we were to turn around and break above the recent highs, that could change everything but I would not hold my breath on that.</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen rather hard during the course of the trading session on Tuesday, as we are now well below the 0.67 level. At this point, the market is looking likely to go down to the 0.6650 level, which is an area where we have seen a lot of previous support. If we were to break down below there, then the market is likely to drop down to the 0.6450 level. Furthermore, we have recently seen the so-called “death cross”, when the 50-Day EMA breaks down below the 200-Day EMA indicator and is generally seen as a negative turn of events. Because of this, I think you got a situation where the market will continue to be more dollar positive than anything else.</p>
      <p>This will continue to be the case as long as the Federal Reserve has decided to be “tighter for longer”, as they have publicly stated. At this point, I think it’s only a matter of time before rallies get sold into at the first signs of exhaustion. With that being said, I like the idea of fading these rallies and taking advantage of momentum, as it continues to see a lot of noise. The Australian dollar of course is a very sensitive currency when it comes to global growth and of course the Chinese mainland, both of which are a bit shaky at the moment, despite the fact that the Chinese have less than desirable numbers at times.</p> 
      <p>The size of the candlestick does suggest that there is a significant amount of downward pressure building in this market, so I do think that a breakdown is only a matter of time before it actually happens. Rallies at this point will more likely than not be sold into at the first signs of exhaustion, and it would take the market breaking above the 200-Day EMA for me to change my opinion on this pair. All things being equal, I think the US dollar continues to be one of the favorite currencies around the world, and therefore I do believe that the Aussie will continue to be threatened by the juggernaut that is the greenback.</p>

      <p>Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, saw its share price rally almost 9% Tuesday, after a panel of judges appeared to be skeptical about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s arguments during an appeals court hearing, as Grayscale continues its push to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund. </p>
      <p>Judges at the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., asked SEC senior counsel Emily Parise details about the connections between bitcoin BTCUSD spot and futures and markets, and questioned the agency’s...</p>
      <p>In June, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC over the agency’s denial of an application to convert GBTC GBTC, +2.64% into an ETF. The SEC has greenlighted several bitcoin futures-backed ETFs, but has yet to approve any ETFs backed by the cryptocurrency itself, citing concerns about market manipulation. </p>
      <p>The lawsuit filed by Grayscale is under the spotlight as it may shed light on whether and when a spot bitcoin ETF might be available in the U.S. Meanwhile, a successful conversion of GBTC into an ETF would help mitigate the discount GBTC has been trading at to its net asset value, or the value of bitcoins it holds. </p>
      <p>Launched in 2013, GBTC traded at a premium to its net asset value for several years, as it was for a long time the only public-listed fund that holds bitcoin as its primary assets. The premium flipped to a discount in February 2021, partly due to the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETF in Canada. However, investors can only sell, but not redeem their shares in the fund, in part as GBTC was structured similar to a close-end fund.</p>
      <p>To close the discount, Grayscale had lobbied the SEC and finally filed a lawsuit against the agency to push for a conversion from GBTC into an ETF. For an ETF, institutional traders can keep creating and redeeming shares, thus closing the gap between the fund’s price and the value of its underlying assets through arbitrages.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to the Court’s final decision, and strongly believe that American investors deserve to have equal access to the Bitcoin ETF product that best suits their needs,” a Grayscale spokeswoman wrote to MarketWatch in an email. </p>
      <p>China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (600900.SS) owns the Three Gorges hydropower electricity generation unit, which has the highest power generation capacity of 22,500 MW. Overall, the company has a power generation capacity of 71,795 MW and has more than 110 other hydroelectric power units under its portfolio. Not only is China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. (600900.SS) the biggest supplier of electricity in China, but it is also the biggest publicly listed hydroelectric power generation and transmission company in the world.</p>

      <p>The dominance of Tethers USDT is rising among stablecoins amid an ongoing shakeup of the $136 billion stablecoin market.</p>
      <p>USDTs market share among stablecoins surpassed 54% on Monday, data from CoinGecko shows. This is the largest market share Tethers stablecoin has reached since late November 2021, after the crypto bull market reached its apex.</p>
      <p>Tethers gain came mostly at the expense of rival Binance USD, which has been in rapid decline since its issuer, Paxos, announced on Feb. 13 that it would halt minting new BUSD tokens due to pressure from the New York Department of Financial Services, the states top regulator. Since then, BUSD has shrunk below $9 billion from a $16 billion market capitalization.</p>  
      <p>USDTs market capitalization has grown some $5.3 billion this year so far to $71.6 billion, with $3 billion of the gains after mid-February. Circles rival stablecoin, USD coin (USDC), has also gained $3 billion since the Paxos announcement; however, its $44 billion market cap is still lower than at the start of 2023.</p>  
      <p>Stablecoins have become the backbone of the crypto economy in recent years, ballooning to a peak market capitalization of$188 billion in May 2022. They peg their price stable to an external asset, such as the U.S. dollar, and serve as a facilitator for trading on exchanges and making transactions between central bank-issued fiat money and the digital asset world.</p>
      <p>Tethers position as issuer of the worlds dominant stablecoin defies its historically opaque reporting about its reserves backing the value of USDT and heavy scrutiny of its internal dealings. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tether used bank accounts accessed by falsified documents in 2018. In September, a New York judge ordered Tether to present financial records on USDTs reserve assets in a lawsuit that alleges Tether conspired to issue USDT to prop up the price of bitcoin (BTC), CoinDesk reported.</p>
      <p>USDT is the most traded cryptocurrency with some $27 billion of trading volume in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, larger than BTC.</p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance’s David Hollerith joins the Live show to discuss the details around Binance’s reported plans to elude U.S. authorities and the expectations for Silvergate Capital.</p>
  <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
  <p>Crypto exchange giant Binance in focus this morning following a report from the Wall Street Journal that, amid the fear of prosecution, Binance had set out on a plan to neutralize US authorities. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on this story. He joins us now. David, what are some of the details here?</p>
  <p>DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, so Jared, just to take a step back, so Binance International is the world's largest crypto exchange. And Binance US is much smaller US regulated crypto exchange. There's been a long running discussion about the relationship between these two firms, and that's become notably a bigger deal as critics have pointed out. And since FTX has collapsed, there are a lot of similarities in terms of structure between the two firms.</p> 
  <p>Things reached a new boiling point on Friday, actually, in bankruptcy court. Voyager Digital is trying to sell its assets to Binance US, and notably, the SEC, the FTC, and several state securities regulators have actively been objecting. And sort of the bankruptcy court is trying to go through all this. So Binance US licenses the Binance brand and technologies, but is technically a separate legal entity, though, it's nonetheless majority owned by Binance's founder and CEO CZ.</p> 
  <p>As far back as 2020, there's actually been reports about sort of a connection to this, and even documents that have shown that Binance, at least, at one point in time, was thinking about trying to find a way to reach US investors without having to deal with US regulators. So the Wall Street Journal story from the weekend drew from chat logs from Binance employees, and this provided further evidence that Binance for some time has been potentially trying to find ways to use Binance US to reach US investors without having to deal with regulators. Reuters has also reported about this extensively, and they've also drawn-- as was in the Journal story, they've drawn a connection to Merit Peak, which was once a market maker for Binance US and is also owned by CZ, Binance's CEO.</p>
  <p>But notably from this story, I think, what was pointed out was the fact that the SEC Chair Gary Gensler was actually being recruited by Binance before he was chair of the agency when he was an MIT professor, and that's notable. If we are to believe the chat logs from Binance employees, it indicated that he was generous in offering licensing strategies to the companies. Obviously, this licensing agreement situation is the legal connection between the two firms. It's also notable as, on Friday, CZ, the founder, actually did a Twitter Space's AMA, and he sort of brought some of this to the public's attention, too, saying that he had met and previously known Gary Gensler, and that they had a good rapport. And he lectured for his MIT course. So this all just makes the connection between what's going on right now with Binance US and the SEC that much more interesting.</p>
  <p>It does, and speaking of connections, I mean, as we talk about the interconnectedness of this crypto world, as we know, one of the potential casualties that you've been watching is Silvergate. What can we expect to happen next with that sort of crypto focused bank?</p>
  <p>DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, Julie, you know, so for Q4, Silvergate fell into a situation, which is they were less than well capitalized or sort of on the brink of being less than well capitalized. There's a leverage ratio that is watched closely by banking regulators, and Silvergate was about 5.3%. Anything below 5% is a concern for regulators, and since then, Silvergate's come out saying they're going to be late on their annual report. Losses look worse, and obviously, last week, we saw the stock collapse by half between Thursday and Friday.</p>
  <p>So in this scenario, Silvergate is a bank. It's a state chartered bank, so it could go into something, which is receivership, which for banks, it's kind of like bankruptcy, not quite the same thing. And this would be decided by either the California State regulator or the FDIC, and in either situation, it would likely be the FDIC that would sort of take the mantle there.</p>
  <p>So we'll be watching that, but again, that's a worst case scenario. And Silvergate has fallen. It's lost so many deposits in the last couple of days. We are definitely expecting something like this to happen.</p>
  <p>Yeah, most definitely, and we'll count on you to keep watching it. Thanks so much, David. Appreciate it.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has gone back and forth during the course of the trading session on Monday, as it looks like it is still trying to figure out what to do with itself. Because of this, the market will be very noisy, but ultimately it looks as if we are going to have to make a bigger decision. Until we get some kind of impulsive candlestick, it’s a bit difficult to get overly aggressive in this pair. It seems as if the 1.20 level is going to continue to be a magnet for the price, therefore you need to pay close attention to how the market continues to react to this area. So far, it looks as if it’s ready to grind back and forth but if you look at the chart a little closer, you can recognize that there have been a series of lower highs along the way.</p>
      <p>Underneath, the 1.1925 level has offered a bit of support, and I think that probably extends down to the 1.1850 area where we had seen a little bit of support previously. Breaking down that level will then kick off the major leg lower, perhaps opening up a move down to the 1.15 level. The 1.15 level of course is very likely to continue to be important due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so with that in mind, I think it’s probably a nice target.</p>  
      <p>However, if we were to turn around and break above the 1.21 level, then it’s possible that we could go to the 1.24 level above, but that double top I think would be difficult to break above anytime soon and I think it extends all the way to the 1.25 level as well. In other words, there’s a lot of noise out there that is going to continue to be a major issue, so therefore I think you’ve got a situation where you have to look at this more or less from a “fade the rally” type of plan, but you should also perhaps look at this as a short-term market more than anything else at the moment.</p>

      <p><strong>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Monday but continues to find plenty of buyers near the ¥163 level. The ¥162.50 level is an area that previously had been important as well, so I do think that there’s a lot of support underneath as it shows signs of importance. The 50-Day EMA looks as if it is ready to turn around and break above the 200-Day EMA, kicking off the so-called “golden cross.”</p>
      <p>The ¥165 level above is an area that could be a target as we pierced it previously, only to turn around and fall apart. Having said that, this is all about the Bank of Japan and the fact that there is going to be a continued need by the central bank to keep interest rates lower in that country. In order to do that, they have to buy bonds in order to keep interest rates from spiking in the country. In order to buy bonds, they have to print yen, and have promised to do so in “an unlimited amount.”</p> 
      <p>Ultimately, the market has been bullish for quite some time, and therefore I think momentum will continue to be part of the picture here. However, you should also keep in mind that recently when we spiked, we tested the top of a major selloff, and therefore I think it will continue to be a major target, but it is going to be so difficult to break above there that I do not anticipate that it happens anytime soon.</p>  
      <p>Short-term pullbacks should continue to be buying opportunities, but you should also keep an eye on the fact that the market is going to be very noisy not only due to the Bank of Japan noise, but the fact that the pair is also very sensitive to risk appetite, which of course is all over the place right now. Because of this, keep in mind that sometimes people will run to the yen when either rates overall drop, or if there is a major fear out there about some type of economic issue. I do believe that eventually we will have to make a bigger decision, but right now it seems like this can be more noise than anything else.</p>

      <p><strong>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Euro has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, as it looks like we’re going to continue to see a lot of noise in this pair. The 50-Day EMA currently sits at roughly 1.0675, and the market has tested that level. Ultimately, this is an indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to, but we are also between that and the 200-Day EMA, which typically means that you are going to see a lot of volatility in general. The 1.06 level is an area that a lot of people have paid close attention to recently, but I think that the support extends all the way down to the 1.05 level. The 1.05 level also features the 200-Day EMA, so it all ties together quite nicely.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA, the market could drop down to the 1.03 level. The 1.03 level is an area that had been important previously. Ultimately, this is a market that continues to see a lot of noisy behavior, which makes quite a bit of sense considering that the economic situation seems to be all over the place. Ultimately, I think this continues to be a lot of noise more than anything else, but it is worth noting that we had seen a lot of selling pressure from the top. When you look at the recent high, you can see that the selloff began with 2 massive negative candlesticks.</p> 
      <p>If the rally did get to that area, I think it would be very difficult to break out above. Quite frankly, I see a significant amount of resistance at multiple levels. The 50-Day EMA of course is a major barrier, and then the 1.07 level is an area where we have seen resistance previously, and of course the 1.08 level. It’s not until we break above there that we can even begin to threaten those massive negative candlesticks where so much had changed in momentum. It is because of this that I think this pair ultimately remains a “fade the rally” type of situation, especially as inflation in the United States remains stubbornly high, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to remain “tighter for longer.”</p>

      <p><strong>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, as we continue to look at the 0.67 level underneath as a potential support level. It has offered support over the last couple of days, so it does make a certain amount of sense that traders continue to come back into this picture. Furthermore, there is a little bit of support underneath there reaching down to the 0.66 level, and therefore I think it’s going to be difficult for this pair to simply fall through the floor. However, it’s probably worth noting that the market has been very choppy in general, therefore I think you probably continue to see a lot of back and forth trading more than anything else.</p>
      <p>The 50-Day EMA has just broken back below the 200-Day EMA, forming the so-called “death cross”, then longer-term sellers may come in and hold short positions. That being said, the 0.68 level above could be resistance, right along with those moving averages. With that being said, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility, and therefore I would not hang on to a position for far too long, due to the fact that there are so many different things out there moving the market around.</p> 
      <p>Keep in mind that the Aussie of course is going to be very sensitive to the idea of global growth, or perhaps even the lack of it, and therefore you need to pay close attention to inflation numbers, and of course GDP numbers around the world. The Australian economy is highly levered to the Chinese economy as well, which although just reopening from the pandemic lockdowns, does not necessarily look blazing hot either, although in all fairness the Chinese economy is probably one of the better performers at the moment.</p>  
      <p>That being said, if the rest of the world is going to slow down, then the Chinese economy will of course suffer as a result. If we do break down below the support region underneath, it could open up a move down to 0.65 level, which is an area where we had seen a lot of noise previously. Breaking above the moving averages could open up a move to the 0.70 level, but that would take a significant amount of momentum.</p>

      <p>The average rate for mortgage offers clicked on by Bankrate readers Thursday was 5.38 percent, up 15 basis points from the previous week. Mortgage rates remain higher than they were a year ago, so it remains important to shop around if you want to find a good deal for a new loan or a refinance.</p>
      <p>Bankrate’s “clicked-on” rate reflects both purchase mortgages and refinances with all terms, including 30-year and 15-year loans.</p>
      <p>The best deals come with some caveats. For instance, to reel in the best combination of interest rate and costs, you generally need a credit score of 740 or higher and a down payment of 20 percent or more. Many of the lowest rates posted on Bankrate.com also require borrowers to buy discount points, a way of lowering the loan’s interest by paying a fee at closing — known as “buying down” the rate.</p>
      <p>Rates for mortgages change constantly, and they’ve recently risen. Those ups and downs reflect the volatility of the mortgage market as the economy continues to grapple with slowing-but-still-significant inflation and a looming recession.</p>
      <p>While it still might make sense to refinance your mortgage, the rationale has changed: Most refis now are being done by homeowners pulling out equity to pay for home renovations or repairs.</p>
      <p>Key Takeway</p>
      <p>Be sure to get offers from at least three lenders — you can save thousands of dollars by comparison shopping.</p>
      <h3>Average clicked on rate for purchase loans</h3>
      <p>The average rate clicked on by Bankrate readers for 30-year purchase mortgages was 6.31 percent on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Average clicked on rate for refinance loans</h3>
      <p>The typical rate clicked on by Bankrate readers for 30-year refinances stood at 6.23 percent Thursday.</p>
      <p>You can use Bankrate’s mortgage payment calculator to estimate your monthly payments and see the effect of making extra payments. The tool can also help you determine how much interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan.</p>

      <p>FILE PHOTO: Foxconn to use Nvidia chips to build self-driving platforms</p>
      <p>By Alexandra Alper</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp's plans to sell technology to China's Huawei would be thwarted if the U.S. government proceeds with a proposal to further restrict shipments to the blacklisted company, a draft report by a government contractor shows.</p>
      <p>The Biden administration has been considering limiting the items it authorizes U.S. companies to ship to telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co, which was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 but which continues to receive billions in U.S. goods under a special plan implemented by the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>"The proposed 2023 amendment of (the Commerce Department's) licensing will likely have a high economic impact on Nvidia," according to excerpts of the draft report seen by Reuters, referring to the company's "pending license value."</p>
      <p>Nvidia's plans to sell to Huawei have not been previously reported.</p>
      <p>A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the document, saying: "The China market presents a significant opportunity for the U.S. semiconductor industry. While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”</p>
      <p>A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department "would not have approved of the report in its current form." It also said the government "has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions."</p>
      <p>The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>Reuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.</p>
      <p>The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a "moderate economic impact" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei "relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering."</p>
      <p>Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.</p>
      <p>Huawei was placed on the "entity list" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level" to be shipped to Huawei was "under assessment."</p>
      <p>But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- With artificial intelligence booming, one key player in the fast-growing space is talking to investors about raising more money after just reaching unicorn status in a funding round late last year.</p>
      <p>The parent company of Stable Diffusion, an AI tool for making digital images, is seeking to raise money at a valuation of about $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because it isn’t public. It isn’t clear how much capital Stability AI Ltd. is seeking to raise in the potential round. A final decision hasn’t been made on whether to go ahead with the financing and the valuation could still change, the people added.</p>
      <p>London-based Stability, whose investors include Coatue Management and Lightspeed Venture Partners, last raised $101 million at a valuation of about $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported in October.</p>
      <p>Representatives for Stability AI didn’t provide a comment.</p>
      <p>That it’s going back to market so soon amid a tech downturn at a much richer valuation underscores how artificial intelligence in recent months has become the hottest topic in Silicon Valley, with the potential to upend entertainment, finance and even education.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Corp., Bloomberg News reported in January, is investing $10 billion in OpenAI, the parent of ChatGPT, a leader in the technology, with tools that can generate uncannily detailed pictures, text and other media with a short prompt. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said Friday that he was stepping down from the board of OpenAI, as his venture capital firm increasingly invests in other AI companies.</p>
      <p>Other tech giants including Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also competing to get out front in AI.</p>
      <p>Stable Diffusion competes with OpenAI’s Dall-E 2, another digital-image tool.</p>
      <p>The way Stable Diffusion works is that people type in a description of an image — say an astronaut riding a horse — and the program spits out a realistic or surrealistic picture. The company says it stands apart from competitors because its open-source software is available to the public. Its practical uses include designing video games to advertisements.</p>

      <p><strong>China E-Commerce Giant JD Set for $1.4 Billion Discount Spree</strong></p>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. will offer discounts across its online shopping platforms from Monday in a 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) campaign to capture new users ahead of an anticipated Chinese economic recovery this year.</p>
      <p>The campaign has spurred concerns that larger rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. or upstart PDD Holdings Inc. may retaliate with cuts of their own, igniting a margin-eroding price war. JD announced the launch of the subsidy plan in a statement on its official WeChat account Saturday.</p>
      <p>China’s internet firms are revving up efforts to outdo each other since Beijing began to wind back its bruising crackdown on the tech sector, spurring an abrupt surge in competition that’s spooking investors. Meituan is said to be expanding into Hong Kong and has embarked on a campaign to hire 10,000 people on the mainland — an effort to beat back heightened competition from new entrants such as ByteDance Ltd. in the $145 billion Chinese food-delivery arena.</p>
      <p>JD shares tumbled after news of the impending rivalry surfaced in domestic media last week. Alibaba executives have since dismissed speculation it would directly engage its longtime rival, warning that a return to the price wars of years past was in nobody’s best interest.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Beijing launched a crackdown campaign to rein in what it called the “reckless expansion of capital,” affecting sectors from e-commerce to online education and the sharing economy. The government has begun rolling back restrictions since late 2022, intent on reviving a Covid-struck economy.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. partner Foxconn Technology Group plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in India to ramp up local production, people familiar with the matter said, underscoring an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.</p>
      <p>The Taiwanese company, also known for its flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., plans to build the plant to make iPhone parts on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public.</p>
      <p>The factory may also assemble Apple’s handsets, some of the people said, and Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business. Apple declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The investment is one of Foxconn’s biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China’s at risk of losing its status as the world’s largest producer of consumer electronics. Apple and other US brands are leaning on their Chinese-based suppliers to explore alternative locations such as India and Vietnam. It’s a rethink of the global supply chain that’s accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.</p>\
      <p>Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu, who met India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not comment on a possible Karnataka investment in a statement on Saturday outlining his visit.</p>
      <p>“My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships, meet old friends and make new ones, and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles,” Liu said. “Foxconn will continue to communicate with local governments to seek the most beneficial development opportunities for the company and all stakeholders.”</p>
      <p>The new production site in India is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, the people said. The company’s sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs some 200,000 at the moment, although that number surges during peak production season.</p>
      <p>Output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain. Foxconn’s decision is the latest move that suggests suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected.</p>
      <p>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</p>
      <p>The plan may herald an accelerated relocation from China for Hon Hai. Once completed, we calculate this factory could materially improve the component supply in India and potentially boost the country’s share of iPhone assembly to 10-15 % from a sub-5% currently.</p>
      <p>— Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts</p>
      <p>Several government officials including India’s deputy tech minister tweeted confirmation of details around the upcoming plant on Friday, including that it will be built soon and create 100,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details, the people said. It’s also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities.</p>

      <p>FILE PHOTO: Twitter corporate headquarters building in San Francisco, California</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - Twitter Inc reported a drop of about 40% year-over-year in both revenue and adjusted earnings for the month of December, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The report comes after several advertisers slashed their spending on the social-media platform after Elon Musk took charge of the company on Oct. 27, resulting in a 71% drop in advertising spend on Twitter during December, data from advertising research firm—Standard Media Index showed.</p>
      <p>Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
      <p>Musk, who warned in November about the possibility of the Twitter going bankrupt, said in December that the company was on track to be "roughly cash flow break-even" in 2023.</p>
      <p>Twitter made its first interest payment in January on a loan that banks provided to help finance billionaire Musk's purchase of the social media company last year.</p>

      <p>(Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp said on Friday it made a "risk-based decision" to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network, its crypto payments network, two days after the digital asset-focused bank raised doubts about its viability.</p>
      <p>"Effective immediately Silvergate Bank has made a risk-based decision to discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN). All other deposit-related services remain operational," Silvergate said in a statement posted on its website.</p>
      <p>The Silvergate Exchange Network, one of the bank's most popular offerings, enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.</p>
      <p>Silvergate shares on Friday slumped more than 2% in after-hours trading, after closing up 0.9% at $5.77 in regular trade. The shares on Thursday had fallen to a record low, ending the day down more than 97% from their all-time high in November 2021.</p>
      <p>Silvergate on Wednesday warned in a filing that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern, disclosing that it had sold additional debt securities this year at a loss and that further losses mean the bank could be “less than well capitalized.”</p>
      <p>After the warning, cryptocurrency heavyweights including Coinbase Global Inc and Galaxy Digital dropped Silvergate as their banking partner. Stablecoin issuers Paxos and Circle, Cboe’s digital asset exchange, and crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Gemini also suspended their partnerships with Silvergate.</p>

      <p>Google is feeling the heat—from employees. With Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing making waves and Google’s answer to it, Bard, suffering a “demoralizing” demo last month, workers want to know the game plan with artificial intelligence and search.</p>
      <p>At an all-hands meeting Thursday, Google workers had the chance to pepper CEO Sundar Pichai and Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk with questions, according to CNBC, which said it obtained audio of the meeting.</p>
      <p>One worker asked the following question via Google’s internal forum Dory, according to CNBC:</p>
      <p>“Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”</p>
      <p>Krawczyk, making his all-hands debut, quickly responded, “I just want to be very clear: Bard is not search.”</p>
      <p>Instead, he said, it’s “a collaborative A.I. service.”</p>
      <p>“The magic that we’re finding in using the product is really around being this creative companion to helping you be the spark plug for imagination, explore your curiosity, etc.,” he said. But, he added, “We can’t stop users from trying to use it like search.”</p>
      <p>Of course, search is very much on the minds of Google investors and employees. When OpenAI shared its A.I. chatbot ChatGPT with the public in late November, thoughts immediately turned to how the technology might disrupt Google’s search dominance.</p>
      <p>Fears about that were hardly allayed when Microsoft launched a ChatGPT-powered rival to Google search last month. (It’s available to a limited number of users for now but will be more widely available soon.)</p>
      <p>Google responded last month with a video of a demo of Bard, but that was botched by a factual error from the chatbot concerning the James Webb Space Telescope. Wall Street promptly punished Google parent Alphabet, sending its shares down sharply.</p>
      <p>Another question on Thursday was about the demo, according to CNBC, with an employee asking, “The first public demo was demoralizing, sent our stock into a nosedive, and invited massive media coverage. What really happened?”</p>
      <p>“Questions like this can be fair and we want to reiterate the fact that Bard has not launched,” Krawczyk replied. “We acknowledged to the world that this is something that we’re experimenting with—we’re testing it. But there’s a lot of excitement in the industry right now.”</p>
      <p>Another worker reportedly commented, “Launching AI seems like a knee-jerk reaction without a strategy.”</p>
      <p>“I disagree with the premise of this question” Pichai responded, noting Google has been “working on A.I. for a long time.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, OpenAI was established in 2015 “as a counterweight to Google” in A.I., Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who helped start it, tweeted last month. He also complained that OpenAI had “become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” (Musk is now reportedly working to establish a rival to OpenAI.)</p>
      <p>But Google, though it’s long been strong on the A.I. research front, has much more to lose than anyone else if users start Googling less and turning to A.I. chatbots more for their search queries.</p>

      <p>MasterCard (MA) closed at $361.50 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.67% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 12.91%.</p>
      <p>Coming into today, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 5.17% in the past month. In that same time, the Business Services sector lost 5.68%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.54%.</p>
      <p>Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.70, down 2.17% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.61 billion, up 8.58% from the year-ago period.</p>
      <p>MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $12.13 per share and revenue of $25.03 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.9% and +12.55%, respectively.</p>
      <p>It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.</p>
      <p>Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% higher. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Valuation is also important, so investors should note that MasterCard has a Forward P/E ratio of 29.32 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.8, which means MasterCard is trading at a premium to the group.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MA's PEG ratio is currently 1.68. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Financial Transaction Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.18 based on yesterday's closing prices.</p>
      <p>The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, putting it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.</p>
      <p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- US stocks ended the week on a high note, driven by speculation that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates beyond peak levels already priced in.</p>
      <p>A rally in the S&P 500 Friday helped snap a three-week losing streak. The Nasdaq 100 scored its best day since early February. Sentiment remained upbeat despite a report showing resilience in the service sector, as some investors wagered the impact of the Fed’s hikes on the economy would be delayed. A measure of prices paid by service providers showed costs rising at a slower pace, which was cheered by traders.</p>
      <p>Bond yields rose for the week though Treasuries rallied on Friday, with the 10-year yield hovering around 3.96%. A benchmark of the dollar had its worst week since mid-January, ending four consecutive weeks of gains.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on the non-farm payrolls report next week for clues on whether the economy can handle more rate hikes. Data this week showed continued labor-market resilience in the US, supporting the case for the Fed to stick to its tightening policy, a theme that had pushed almost every major asset into the red in February.</p>
      <p>But investors were heartened after Atlanta Fed’s Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that the central bank could possibly pause its rate hikes sometime this summer. Traders interpreted his comments as dovish, even though Bostic and his colleagues said decisions would continue to be data dependent and a Fed report on Friday emphasized that further rate increases are in store.</p>

      <p>Traders are still optimistic because even the most hawkish Fed officials haven’t suggested that rates could need to go beyond levels already baked in, said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. Swap markets have been pricing a peak Fed policy rate of 5.5% in September.</p>
      <p>“I think they stay at 5.5% and we have to see how data evolves in the second quarter,” she said on Bloomberg Television.</p>
      <p>Misra also added that robust data doesn’t mean the Fed’s persistent tightening isn’t working.</p>
      <p>“It takes a long time,” she said. “Policy only turned restrictive last year.”</p>

      <p>Risk sentiment also received a boost on Friday from forecast-beating factory data from China. Oil gained for the fourth day, with confidence in China’s robust rebound supporting prices.</p>

      <p>US stocks climbed higher on Friday, snapping a weekly losing streak as investors dialed back fears of aggressive rate hikes.</p>
      <p>All three indices ended the day higher, with the Dow gaining almost 400 points to break a four-week streak of losses.</p>
      <p>Investors digested comments from Federal Reserve officials on the central bank's next policy move. Though Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller said interest rates could tread higher than markets were currently expecting, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic signaled for just a 25 basis-point hike in March, spurring a rally in stocks during the session on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from the key 4% level, falling 11 basis points on Friday to 3.96%.</p>
      <p>However, ISM manufacturing data ticked higher, from 47.4 to 47.7 last month, a sign that manufacturing activity is still expanding despite the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</p>
      <p>"The solid ISM survey and resilience to high interest rates will reinforce the Fed's resolve that interest rates should continue to move higher. Even so, the Fed is unlikely to go back to rate hikes of more than a quarter percent per decision," Comercia Bank chief economist Bill Adams said in a statement. "The Fed wants to tread lightly to minimize the risk that they overshoot and cause an unnecessarily severe downturn."</p>

      <p><strong>Stock Traders Are Ignoring Blaring Bond Alarms</strong></p>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- The fixed-income market’s unblemished record of striking fear into the hearts of equity traders is in danger.</p>
      <p>With rates on two- and 10-year Treasuries up a sixth straight week, and payouts on cash at or above the earnings yield of the S&P 500, stock investors are barely registering a shrug. Benchmark US share indexes just posted their biggest runup in a month, climaxing Friday with a jump in the Nasdaq 100 that topped any since early February.</p>
      <p>Why peace is breaking out in risky assets during a week that at one point saw yields in the entire Treasury market rise above 4% is a mystery Wall Street has no easy answer for. Charts may be one reason: the S&P 500 bounced sharply after falling below its 200-day average on Wednesday. Another may be that investors are interpreting elevated rates as a sign strong economic data is likely to persist, says Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance LLC.</p>
      <p>“It’s interesting to see stocks whistling past the graveyard,” Zaccarelli said. “Stock investors may be looking for yields to drop as a sign we are going to have a recession and are seeing an all-clear in the sense that rates are higher.”</p>
      <p>The indifference to calamity on display in stocks was particularly vivid as the week ended. Friday’s 1.6% gain in the S&P 500 pushed the Cboe Volatility Index below 19, testing lows hit when equities surged at the start of the year. A basket of most-shorted stocks rose 3.2% — it’s fifth straight advance — while a gauge of unprofitable technology companies vaulted almost 6%.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-84-1.webp" alt="ncx-blogs"/>
      <p>It’s happening even as money cascades out of stock-focused ETFs and into fixed-income funds, as risk-free yields reach multi-year highs. Short-dated Treasury bills are enticing investors as yields push above 5%, eclipsing the payout on everything from profits generated by S&P 500 companies to those offered by the traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p>
      <p>But while the trade is touted as risk free, it comes with opportunity costs. Grasping for a 5% yield right in an S&P 500 bear market strikes certain money managers as an iffy proposition.</p>
      <p>“That short rate isn’t going to be at those levels forever — it’s probably going to end up lower,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. “What we’ve seen over long periods of time is that the long-term assets outperform cash. And we have every reason to believe that’s going to be the case.”</p>
      <p>Over the past year, the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill exchange-traded fund (ticker BIL) has returned about 2%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 6.3% on a total return basis. However, over the past decade BIL is flat, while SPY soared 165% during an epic bull run.</p>
      <p>“There’s much less ‘opportunity cost’ than what we’re used to because it’s a place where you can get paid while you wait, but there’s not long-term price potential like in equities,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “So for people with more than a five-year time horizon, you still need equities in the portfolio to set you up for compounding returns.”</p>
      <p>The notion that yields may be peaking also has investors preaching caution when it comes to bonds. While bets have been building in recent weeks that the Fed will ultimately need to raise rates past 5% to stamp out inflation — boosting yields across the Treasury curve — traders are pricing in an end to increases by September.</p>
      <p>Tipp hearkened back to the 1970s, when inflation was a threat to both stocks and bonds. As growth moderated and rates leveled off and then came down, equities rose — even though the economy remained weak.</p>
      <p>“There’s a good chance that that kind of cyclicality is going to make its way through the markets, and people that lock in at the short term, exit the long-term markets and go into short term are going to suffer,” he said. “Their long-term returns are not going to be as high because the cash rates will probably move lower.”</p>
      <p>Analysts say that the haven appeal of cash-like positions combined with reliable returns means investors have an attractive place to wait out any turbulence induced by the Fed’s path.</p>
      <p>“I do think that we need to take advantage of the higher yields on the short-end of the yield curve, wait out this continued volatility,” David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management, said in an interview. “And then at some point we’ll hit a bottom, and that will be a great time to re-risk, take that money out of cash, put it back in equities and you’ll benefit from that.”</p>
      <p>Six-month Treasury bills currently yield about 5.1%, the highest since 2007, compared to the S&P 500’s earnings yield of roughly 5.3%. That’s the slimmest advantage for stocks since 2001.</p>
      <p>Though bonds look attractive at current yields relative to equities, the risk investors are taking in allocating to cash is the uncertainty of that yield going forward, said Josh Emanuel, chief investment officer at Wilshire, which oversees roughly $90 billion.</p>
      <p>“So, cash may pay you 4.5-5% today, but in one year that may not be the case, in two years that may not be the case,” he said in an interview. “The challenge in allocating to cash is that while you’re not taking any duration risk and you’re not taking any credit risk, the risk that you’re taking is the opportunity cost or the uncertainty risk associated with what that cash will pay you in the future relative to the yield you can lock in over the longer-term by moving out further on the yield curve.”</p>

      <p>Cryptocurrency markets are tumbling as the industry's once go-to bank faces a slew of financial woes, potentially threatening global crypto liquidity.</p>
      <p>The price of bitcoin hit a two-week low early Friday and experienced its largest one-hour price drop since the blowup of bankrupt exchange FTX in November. The token is trading 4% lower at $$22,394, per Messari.</p>  
      <p>Other major tokens followed suit. Ethereum shed 3%, falling to $1,573.</p> 
      <p>The market moves come after several companies like Coinbase, Circle, Galaxy Digital, and Paxos cut ties with Silvergate, which is delaying its annual report due to greater losses, flagging doubts about the future of its business.</p>
      <p>Many large digital asset exchanges work with Silvergate for transactions between entities, and a dent in those relationships could impact industry liquidity.</p>
      <p>Silvergate was entangled in a number of ailing firms such as FTX, resulting in a massive decline in deposits at the bank amid broader crypto market contagion. Shares of Silvergate have dropped 95% in the past year.</p>
      <p>"Fears are growing that a crypto-focused bank failure could constitute a new hit to investors' confidence after the bankruptcies of major crypto players during the last few months," Wael Makarem, senior market strategist at investment broker Exness, told Insider. "As a result, the market could be exposed to new price corrections while investors could be concerned about a potential impact on other market players."</p>
      <p>Makarem added: "This incident could strongly dent the market's recent rebound as cryptocurrencies remain in a delicate position. Additionally, the dwindling number of companies operating in crypto could add to the concerns."</p>
      <p>Crypto's total market capitalization sits above $1 trillion, per Messari, roughly two-thirds below its record high in November of 2021. Investor sentiment in digital assets took a beating in the past year on a series of crypto company bankruptcies, along with a rise in borrowing costs from a hawkish Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>Sentiment may have deteriorated further in cryptocurrency markets as traders brace themselves for the Fed's next move to tamp down inflation, which remains above the central bank's target.</p>

      <h3>S&P 500 Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The S&P 500 initially dipped during the trading week to show signs of weakness, only to turn around and show signs of life again. We are back above the 4000 level, so that of course is a good sign, but at the end of the day, this is a market that looks as if it is trying to roll over. Keep in mind that we have just gone through a significant portion of earnings, and it’s been a mixed bag to say the least.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the bottom of the candlestick for the week, then it is likely that we could go down to the 3800 level, an area that previously had been rather supportive. By bouncing from there, it puts an imprint of support in that region that I think a lot of people will be paying attention to. On the upside, we have the 4100 level, which was previous support, but even more importantly we have the 4200 level above that has caused quite a bit of selling pressure, almost like a brick wall. That’s an area where we continue to see a lot of noise, so it does make a target that a lot of people may look for, but breaking above there might be a completely different question.</p>
      <p>You can see that I had a channel drawn previously, and we did break out of it only to turn around and retest that area for potential support. Either way, this is a market that I think continues to see a lot of volatility, so longer term traders may struggle.</p>

We ended up forming a bit of an inverted hammer, so therefore it’s going to be interesting to see how this plays out. The previous week formed the same candlestick, and the week before that was very similar. In other words, every time we rally it looks like the sellers are starting to come back in and push lower.</p>
      <p>It looks as if the area around the 1.19 level is going to continue to be support, so I do think it’s worth watching. Breaking down through that area then opens up a bigger drop from what I can see, which of course is what would coincide with the longer-term trend. We had bounced rather significantly to test the 50% Fibonacci level, and then even formed a bit of a double top in that area. By doing so, this is a market that I believe continues to be very noisy, but in the end will find plenty of sellers to come in and punish it.</p> 
      <p>If global risk appetite continues to struggle, I just don’t see how this market takes off to the upside. A breakdown below the 1.1850 level will open up a move down to the 1.15 level, followed by the 1.1250 level. That does not necessarily mean that it will be sudden or have a lot of momentum, but that certainly looks as if it would be the more likely of scenarios right now.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin plunged nearly 5% over Thursday night following a Wednesday late notice filed by major industry bank Silvergate Capital that expressed doubts about the future of its business.</p>
      <p>In line with Bitcoin, the total market capitalization for crypto assets fell 4.6% from $1.06 trillion to $1.02 trillion between 8:18 p.m. to 9:05 p.m. Thursday New York time.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin hasn’t plunged so fast and sharp since the price fell by 4% from $20,538 to $19,704 on the morning of November 8 as FTT, the token for crypto exchange FTX, faced massive withdrawals.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin BTC-USD is changing hands at $22,381, down 4.3% for the last 24 hours and 6.4% over the past week.</p>
      <p>"After today’s drop, the pullback is close to 10%, and bitcoin is on pace to close below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time in nearly two months," according to a Friday note from BeSpoke.</p>
      <p>Over the past two days, the crypto market is coming to grips with the potential failure of industry-serving bank, Silvergate.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately, Silvergate is not FTX. Silvergate is more of a fiat on/off-ramp for U.S. Dollars, rather than a key source of liquidity and volume for the entire crypto ecosystem,” said Michael Safai, a co-founder and partner of crypto proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital.</p>
      <p>The La Jolla, Calif., headquartered Silvergate said in a Wednesday late notice it would further delay its annual report due to greater losses than it showed in January preliminary results in addition to “certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company” and its "ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements," according to the filing.</p>
      <p>Through Thursday, major crypto exchanges and businesses quickly distanced themselves from Silvergate. The shares of the bank (SI) has fallen 62% from Thursday morning to Friday's open from $13.50 to $5.14.</p>
      <p>Further exacerbating Silvergate’s business challenges, Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, BitStamp, Crypto.com, Cboe Digital, GSR and Circle each issued statements saying they have cut ties with what was once considered a crucial banking partner for the sector.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle added, it is “in the process of unwinding certain services with them.”</p>
      <p>Separately, Binance US and Kraken would not comment on their exposure to Silvergate.</p>
      <p>“There is some dismay around the Silvergate news, but it's not clear it would trigger strong selling,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, told Yahoo Finance Friday.</p>
      <p>Dexterity's Safal agreed: “It’s more a case of jaded traders digesting the news and not wanting to be left holding any potential ticking time bombs, but not understanding how this differs from the collapses of 2022."</p>
      <p>Safai also suggested the response may have come from Asian markets reacting to the exodus of firms from Silvergate.</p>
      <p>Over Thursday, March 2, $203 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated or $198 million net of short liquidations — the most in a single day in three weeks — according to crypto derivatives aggregator Coinglass.</p>
      <p>As Acheson noted in her Friday newsletter, given little change of the ETH to BTC ratio, bitcoin's sharp drop hit the second largest cryptocurrency ether "in equal measure." Ether is changing hands at $1,570 per coin, down less than 4% for the past day as of Friday morning 8:30 New York time.</p>
      <p>In a worst case scenario of Silvergate's failure, confidence could be shaken, causing some firms to yank capital from the market, Dexterity's Safai said.</p>
      <p>“That in itself could impact liquidity, but that wouldn’t have a ripple effect per se, nor would it last very long,” he added.</p>
      <p>More important for Acheson are the repercussions for banking access if a traditional bank were to “go under” due to its crypto activities.</p>
      <p>“That would give regulators strong ammunition that crypto risks could become 'systemic' and any financial instiution serving the crypto industry could come up against new barriers,” Acheson explained over a messaging app.</p>
      <p>"Uncertainty is currently high," she added.</p>

      <p>The expected launch of the Shanghai hard fork has been delayed from late March to the first two weeks of April, according to Ethereum developers at a meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Shanghai hard fork will be the first major upgrade since the “Merge” last September. A hard fork is a permanent split between a new blockchain and its latest version, often adding or fixing features of a network.</li>
        <li>The Shanghai fork will allow validators to withdraw their locked Ether for the first time since the staking feature went live in 2020. Over 17 million Ether (about US$26.7 billion) has since been staked.</li>
        <li>During the meeting, core developers agreed that the hard fork should occur at least two weeks after the “Goerli testnet launch,” which has been scheduled for March 14.</li>
        <li>The “Shanghai Capella” upgrade to Goerli, one of Ethereum’s popular testnets, will be the last chance for Ethereum clients and staking providers to ensure the Shanghai hard fork can go through smoothly when the final “mainnet” version launches.</li>
        <li>“So imagine Goerli happens on the 14th, everything goes well, and on the 16th, we agree to move forward with mainnet – I think the earliest that puts us is like the first week of April,” said Ethereum core developer and project coordinator Tim Beiko.</li>
        <li>Beiko noted in a Thursday Twitter thread that the Ethereum team did not explicitly agree to a mainnet date. Still, they will “probably” set a date during the next developers meeting slated for March 16, “assuming things go well on Goerli.”</li>

      <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Just $694 million in assets of $2.2 billion recovered are easy to cash in.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>FTX has identified a $9.5 billion shortfall in top crypto and cash needed to repay customers, its new bosses have said, with just $694 million in currency that's easy to cash in.</p>
      <p>In a press release on Thursday, FTX shared the extent of the company's deficit as bankruptcy lawyers scramble to unravel a mess that led to billions of dollars' worth of customer funds getting lost.</p>
      <p>The bankrupt crypto exchange's new executives have so far identified $2.2 billion in assets in the company's wallets, of which only $694 million were in the most liquid currencies, like fiat, stablecoins, bitcoin, or ethereum.</p>
      <p>Lawyers have also identified $385 million of customer receivables, and substantial claims against Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, the company at the center of FTX's controversial collapse. FTX lent $9.3 billion to Alameda, they said.</p>
      <p>"It has taken a huge effort to get this far. The exchanges' assets were highly commingled, and their books and records are incomplete and, in many cases, totally absent," CEO John Ray wrote.</p>
      <p>"For these reasons, it is important to emphasize that this information is still preliminary and subject to change."</p>
      <p>FTX US also has a shortfall, with $191 million in assets versus $335 million of customer claims and $283 million of related party claims payable.</p>
      <p>In January, bankruptcy lawyers said they had recovered $5.5 billion in liquid assets from FTX.</p>
      <p>But lawyers still don't know the extent of losses to customer funds, which burned famous faces like Tom Brady and Kevin O'Leary. The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has estimated that $8 billion of client money had been lost by the exchange.</p>
      <p>Its latest presentation suggested there is a $9.5 billion deficit across its most liquid assets, and a $733 million surplus in category B assets — those which are harder to retrieve — including through the FTX native coin FTT.</p>
      <p>It was reported in November that FTX could have one million creditors.</p>

      <p>By Mehnaz Yasmin</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - The reward for holding U.S. stocks over Treasury bonds has not been this unattractive since 2004, possibly setting the stage for the sought-after 60/40 portfolio diversification to make a comeback after one of its worst years on record.</p>
      <p>A 60/40 portfolio, which typically has 60% of its holdings in stocks and the remaining 40% in fixed income, counts on moves in the two asset classes to offset one another, with stocks strengthening amid economic optimism and bonds rising during turbulent times.</p>
      <p>The strategy took a backseat in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to rein in inflation. However, signals from the stock and bond markets this year are pointing to a return of the popular asset allocation strategy.</p>
      <p>At the end of February, the S&P 500 returned 5.41% in earnings yield, the reciprocal of price-to-earnings ratio, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond surged to 3.94%, according to data from Refinitiv. The 1.47 percentage-point difference is the lowest upside stocks have held over bonds in nearly two decades.</p>
      <p>Earnings yield here refers to the S&P 500 earnings per share estimate for the next 12 moths divided by the index price.</p>
      <p>Graphic:https://www.reuters.com/graphics/STOCK-SPREADS/CHART/byprlqxyepe/chart.png</p>
      <p>"The relative shine of equities is definitely dulled by rising yields across the Treasury curve," said Eric Leve, chief investment officer of wealth and investment management firm Bailard.</p>
      <p>With estimates for earnings in 2023 implying essentially no growth over 2022, rates above 5% on short-term bonds and 10-year yields on the verge of 4% represent credible alternatives to stocks, according to Leve.</p>
      <p>The thinning spread between returns from stocks and bonds is set to bring the 60/40 portfolio strategy back in favor.</p>
      <p>"This strategy does provide excellent hedging in current environment," said Glenn Yin, Head of Research and Analysis at AETOS Capital Group.</p>
      <p>The 60/40 portfolio has already had the best start to the year since 1991, according to Bank of America.</p>
      <p>The Fed's move to tighten monetary policy at the fastest pace in decades pumped up bond yields after nearly two years of near-zero interest rates.</p>
      <p>But a rise in yields poses headwinds for equities, especially growth stocks, and by extension, a large index like the S&P 500. Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among the tech heavyweights that make up nearly a fifth of the index and bore the brunt of a sell-off last year.</p>
      <p>"Equity yields will continue to struggle this year as both prices and earnings decline" amid an economic slowdown, said Lance Roberts, Chief Investment Strategist at RIA Advisors.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, "during a recession, yields will fall and Treasury bond prices will rise," said Roberts. He prefers bonds over stocks today, he added.</p>
      <p>Recent results and guidance from companies have bolstered the case for investors who believe the stock market's early-year rally is unlikely to last.</p>
      <p>As of Feb. 24, results from 465 of the S&P 500 companies showed fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have fallen 3.2% from the year-ago quarter while Wall Street's expectation for S&P earnings growth for 2023 fell to 1.7% from an expected 4.4% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Expectations for U.S. earnings to decline in the first two quarters if the year come amid weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results for 2022, which Credit Suisse estimates will be the worst earnings season outside of a recession in 24 years.</p>
      <p>Investors are hoping that in case of a severe recession, the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates. While the economic downturn would hit stock returns, drop in bond yields should provide some relief in such a scenario, according to analysts.</p>
      <p>"For me, the best risk-reward portfolio in this environment for now is long duration Treasury bonds, and deep value, dividend equities," Roberts said. Deep value refers to stocks that are trading at a huge discount to their intrinsic values.</p>
      <p>"When the recession arrives, and the Fed cuts rates to zero, I will sell my bond portfolio to lock in the capital appreciation, and buy distressed equities with high yields and companies with strong balance sheets and earnings growth," he added.</p>

        <li>Crypto companies are cutting ties with Silvergate, once the go-to bank for digital currencies</li>
        <li>This comes after the crypto bank flagged doubts about its survival.</li>
        <li>Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial and other big names have ditched the lender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the biggest names in crypto have backed away from lender Silvergate Capital after the key digital-currency player warned it's having to evaluate its ability to survive.</p>
      <p>Coinbase, Paxos Trust, Circle Internet Financial and Galaxy Digital Holdings all said Thursday they plan to suspend banking with Silvergate, as did the Winklevoss twins' Gemini.</p>
      <p>Crypto.com and Cboe's digital arm are also stepping away, Bloomberg reported.</p>
      <p>The exodus of crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers and trading desks came after Silvergate flagged doubts about its future in business.</p>
      <p>It said it was delaying the filing of its annual report to regulators because it needs more time to look into how badly its finances have been hit by the events battering the crypto world.</p>
      <p>"The company is evaluating the impact that these subsequent events have on its ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of its financial statements," the California-based firm said in an SEC filing Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Silvergate's stock price plunged to close 58% lower on Thursday, and was down 5.24% at $5.42 in premarket trading Friday. Shares have fallen almost 95% in the past 12 months, as more than a dozen of its crypto firm customers shut down, were fined or came under investigation.</p>
      <p>Silvergate used to be the go-to bank for the biggest names in crypto, operating a key payments network used for real-time transfers between the firms.</p>
      <p>But the lender has struggled in recent months thanks to its ties to embattled crypto players, and it is seen as having suffered during as prices of digital assets tumbled last year.</p>
      <p>It has been caught up in fallout from the implosion of now-bankrupt FTX, which was one of the lender's major clients. Its customers withdrew $8 billion in deposits late last year after the crypto exchange collapsed in November.</p>
      <p>In addition, it had relationships with other bankrupt crypto firms, like centralized lenders Celsius and BlockFi, along with digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital. It has also has worked with crypto exchange Binance's US arm, which is reportedly under criminal investigation for money laundering and criminal sanctions violations.</p>
      <p>As fears swirled that Silvergate's troubles would spread through the crypto sector, companies stepped up to underline their positions.</p>
      <p>MicroStrategy said it doesn't have any financial relationship with Silvergate, other than a loan it needs to pay back to Silvergate by 2025.</p>
      <p>"For anyone wondering, the loan wouldn't accelerate b/c of SI insolvency or bankruptcy. Our BTC collateral isn't custodied w/ SI & we have no other financial relationship w/ SI,"  the business intelligence firm tweeted.</p>
      <p>Stablecoin Tether is not exposed to Silvergate either, its chief technology officer said in a tweet Thursday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts cut their rating on Silvergate stock to "underweight" from "neutral" and withdrew its $14 price target, CoinDesk reported. It also said broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded the bank's rating to "hold" from "buy" and slashed its price target to $9 from $25.</p>

      <p>Interest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst 0xAcid's dashboard on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.</p>
      <p>According to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.</p>
      <p>In June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.</p>
      <p>A crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.</p>
      <p>The record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.</p>
      <p>WBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.</p>
      <p>The Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.</p>
      <p>According to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.</p>
      <p>"Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX," Osmo tweeted early Friday.</p>
      <p>At press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20. The cryptocurrency has seen a 50% appreciation in its market value this year, per CoinDesk data.</p>

      <p>Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, sold 650 bitcoins out of 683 it mined in February.</p>
      <p>The company said it sold the bitcoin to help pay for operating expenses and for general corporate purposes, according to a statement. Marathon sold 1,500 bitcoins in January, which marked the first time it had unloaded any of its holdings.</p>
      <p>Even with the February sales, said company Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, Marathon increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 8,090 bitcoins as of Jan. 31, 2023, to 8,260, valued at $191.2 million as of Feb. 28.</p>
      <p>The move to sell brings Marathon's strategy in line with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year. Prior to January, Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even though the company in May 2022 indicated it could become a seller at some point.</p>
      <p>Turning to operations, Marathon said it had installed computing power of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) at the end of February, up from 11 EH/s a month earlier, and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023. The company ended the month with $219.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, according to the statement.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the miner cancelled its earnings report and said that it will need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and currently unaudited quarterly reports from 2022 after an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) flagged technical accounting matters. Riot Platforms on Thursday also said it will delay its 10-K filings with the SEC due to due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
      <p>Marathon's shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday, remaining higher by more than 80% in 2023. Bitcoin is down about 1% over the last 24 hours and higher by 42% year to date.</p>

      <p>CORRECTION (March 3, 12:13 UTC): Corrects story to state that Riot has already filed its 10-K report after asking for an extension.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) delayed the filing of its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets.</p>
      <p>“After assessing the impact of this revised impairment assessment methodology, the Registrant determined that material errors in certain of its financial statements and reports resulted,” Riot wrote in its SEC filing on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Specifically, Riot said its previously issued financial statements for 2022, 2021 and 2020 “contained material errors and should not be relied upon.”</p>
      <p>For those reasons, Riot said it needed additional time to complete its 10-K and it has since done so and filed its report for 2022.</p>
      <p>Shares of Riot were down 2.4% in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, fellow miner Marathon Digital (MARA) said it would need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and unaudited quarter reports from 2022 following an inquiry from the SEC that questioned its method of calculating impairment on digital assets.</p>
      <p>Marathon had previously been scheduled to release its 2022 Q4 results after the close of trading on Tuesday, but now has postponed that.</p>

      <p>As firms add more and more blockchains to their strategic road maps, I grow more and more frustrated. Where, I keep wondering, do firms have the money to properly understand and implement such an enormous array of blockchains in their operations? At EY, it costs us about $500,000 to add a new chain to our Blockchain Analyzer platform and we spend between 10%-20% of that amount each year keeping up to date.</p>
      <p>While setting up network nodes may not be too difficult, understanding how networks operate and the mechanics of transfers and payments is another matter. When we add a network, we take a close look at the transaction processing model (how transactions are initiated, recorded, processed and reported); the cryptography that underpins those transactions; and the risks that might be associated with different steps in the process. When it comes to audits, we even identify control points where we can perform verification steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.</strong></p>
      <p>Nor are these networks static entities. Ethereum has two to four hard forks a year and other smart contract-enabled chains evolve at a similar rate. The result: Staying up to date on a large number of different blockchains is costly.</p>
      <p>Cost isn’t the only factor, either. Liquidity becomes an issue as well. Polling Automated Market Makers (AMM) for their sample prices by volumes of proposed swaps on different token pairs shows how quickly liquidity drops off once you leave the Ethereum blockchain. Even within public Ethereum, trading is highly concentrated among the top tokens. Tokens without liquidity are much more vulnerable to price manipulation.</p>
      <p>Insufficient liquidity in an inadequately regulated market is one of the main reasons the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected applications for bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). The last year has shown, time and again, that crypto asset prices are often manipulated. So these concerns are unlikely to go away and will increasingly deter firms for interacting with, or transacting upon, less-liquid ecosystems.</p>
      <p>As if it wasn’t complicated enough, just deciding which chains to add is a constantly changing mix. Over the last few years, there has been a constant stream of “Ethereum killer” chains taking up the #2 spot in the ecosystem. A good measure of “who’s on top” is the DeFiLlama scorecard showing Ethereum dominance of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFiLlama tracks nearly 140 different chains. At various times, Binance, Terra, Tron and Celo have been in second place, but none has ever represented more than about 20% of the total DeFi ecosystem value. Usually the second chain by volume is at 10% or less.</p>
      <p>Nor is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility a useful factor in de-risking a chain’s adoption. EVM compatibility means that (in theory) applications written for Ethereum’s virtual machine will run on any other chain making that claim. Theory doesn’t always match reality exactly, however. As a result, EVM compatibility may actually increase risk.</p>
      <p>EVM compatibility is not perfect and the implementation on each chain is slightly different. While this can definitely make it simpler to deploy new smart contracts on a different chain, they may behave differently in a fully “compatible” environment and the claim of compatibility may increase risk that people deploy without careful consideration. We often encounter novel errors when moving smart contracts from bitcoineum testnets to the mainnet. I don’t see cross-chain deployment being easier under any conditions.</p>
      <p>All of this aligns with our own experience, which has shown that the amount of work required to qualify a new asset or service for our audit tools on Ethereum is significantly lower than other chains. That’s because we already have a strong understanding of the underlying ecosystem. Ethereum also offers far more liquidity than any other chain, all of it inside the same ecosystem with no cross-chain bridge risk.</p>
      <p>One way to anticipate how a much more regulated future looks is to examine how the biggest centralized or traditional finance firms are looking at the market for crypto assets. These firms are highly regulated and need to document their processes and work extensively to demonstrate they are not mishandling their client responsibilities. What you will see, over and over again, is that many of the biggest regulated firms have largely limited their offerings to BTC and ether (ETH) and have been very slow to grow that footprint. </p>
      <p>When the most regulated firms do start adding to the mix, my own prediction is they will begin by adding more tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem and, perhaps, adding curated sets of DeFi services from Ethereum as well. I had, in the past, expected that we would have seen this expansion during 2022. But the market turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny in the second half of last year caused many firms to move more slowly and increase their focus on compliance.</p>
      <p>All of these challenges were much easier to ignore when every chain was growing, venture-capital funding was plentiful and regulatory scrutiny was light. All those sunny conditions are gone now and the game is different. Between slashing burn rates and regulatory scrutiny, the multichain era is drawing to a close.</p>

      <p>US stocks rallied Thursday as a Federal Reserve official's comments on coming interest rates hikes cheered investors.</p>
      <p>After opening in mixed territory, the major indexes closed in the green, even as the 2-year note yield reached levels not seen in over a decade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped more than 300 points to lead the gains, supported by Salesforce's strong earnings.</p>
      <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he's "very firmly" in favor of a quarter-point hike for now, adding that it's important for the central bank to move cautiously.</p>
      <p>That comes after other Fed officials have hinted at the possibility of a half-point increase as recent data have pointed to a resilient economy that needs more slowing to get inflation under control.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, jobless claims fell for a third straight week, remaining below 200,000, in a sign the labor market is still strong.</p>

        <li>Nasdaq Composite: 11,462.98, up 0.73%</li>

      <p><strong>Here's what else happened today:</strong></p>

      <p>Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are moving in Friday's intraday trading.</p>
      <p><strong>Video Transcript</strong></p>
      <p>[AUDIO LOGO]</p>
      <p>- Yeah. And taking a look at the market reaction here this morning too. You do see a little bit of just before the start of that 10:00 AM hour, it's moved lower off of, though, some of the intraday highs that we had seen early in today's trading activity on the Dow Jones Industrial average. Still holding onto gains of about a quarter of a percent in the green.</p>
      <p>The NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that also in positive territory. Up triple digits on a point basis. Percentage basis, it's up by about 1%. We'll round that off too. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 7/10 of a percent right now. Still holding on to those gains.</p>
      <p>And additionally, checking in on the major sectors here. The S&P 500 11. Taking a look at those sectors, and XLB is leading the pack, at least on that previous time scale that was loaded up on the screen. XLRE here on the day, on this Fri-yay, it's higher by about 1.25%. But you've got XLP. Yeah, indeed. Consumer staples not looking so hot, hot, hot. Down by about 7/10 of a percent here this morning, and we'll continue to watch that as we move on throughout the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>Overall though, you've got more gainers than laggards here, and we'll continue to keep a close eye on that. Taking a look at some of the Dow components as well. Apple is really leading the charge today. You're seeing that higher by about 2.5%. We've got much more on that this hour as well. And taking a look at the NASDAQ, you've also got a pretty mixed picture here. We'll kind of put this on a broader heat map view. It looks like more gainers than laggards. Just a rough look at things here on the day.</p>

      <p>For developers, decentralized and composable front ends offer a way to build and launch better apps and faster forking of existing pieces and components, while leveraging built-ins such as profiles, payments and notifications as well as searching, without the need to host anything themselves, according to the press release.</p>
      <p>“The composable decentralized front ends as a framework can work with any Web2 or Web3 back end and any wallet,” Polusukhin said. “In the future we will be offering [use of] wallets from one chain to interact with another via seamless bridging,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Near protocol currently ranks as the 35th largest blockchain in terms of market capitalization, according to data from Messari. The layer 1’s market cap was around $1.96 billion and its NEAR token was trading at around $2.28, at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>The platform is dubbed a “blockchain operating system (BOS),” according to the press release. “We are moving away from our layer 1 focus, it’s now about the user and the experience they have. We are looking at this as the frontend for blockchains in general,” said Polosukhin, in an interview with CoinDesk.</p>
      <p>Polosukhin added the platform is hoping to tackle some of the user experience issues in the Web3 space. “As a user at the moment it’s hard to find a single place to look at Web3 apps, there’s no search mechanism or way to navigate between them,” said Polosukhin. “The BOS creates a single point of entry. ”</p>

      <p>By Samuel Indyk and Rae Wee</p>
      <p>LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - The dollar slumped and China's yuan gained on Wednesday after China's manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace since April 2012, while the euro rose after regional German inflation data signalled price pressures remain high.</p>
      <p>The Australian and New Zealand dollars were also among the beneficiaries of the robust Chinese data, which smashed expectations with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) shooting up to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January.</p>
      <p>China's non-manufacturing activity also grew at a faster pace in February, while the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI reading for last month likewise surpassed market expectations.</p>
      <p>The onshore yuan finished the domestic session at 6.8854 per dollar, the strongest close since Feb. 21, while the offshore yuan jumped 1.3% to 6.8683 per dollar, set for its largest one-day gain since late November.</p>
      <p>"The data confirms expectations that the growth outlook has improved quite significantly in China, so it's positive for risk sentiment," said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.</p>
      <p>"This has put the dollar on the defensive."</p>
      <p>The kiwi surged 1.3% to $0.6263, while the Aussie gained 0.7% to $0.6774, reversing the slide to a two-month low earlier on Wednesday following soft domestic economic data.</p>
      <p>The antipodean currencies are often used as liquid proxies for the yuan.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, inflation data from five German states was largely unchanged in the high single digits in February, pointing to no let-up in stubborn price pressures at the national level.</p>
      <p>Preliminary pan-German inflation data is to be published at 1300 GMT, calculated using data from up to 16 German states.</p>
      <p>Figures released on Tuesday showed accelerating inflation in France and Spain, two of the euro zone's biggest economies, pushing up expectations for rate hikes by the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
      <p>The euro was last up 0.9% against the dollar to $1.0672 , on track for its biggest daily gain since Feb. 1.</p>
      <p>"The euro is being well supported by the inflation data," Nordea's Christensen said.</p>
      <p>"We're looking for a more solid euro area inflation reading tomorrow than we had expected going into this week."</p>
      <p>Sterling rose 0.2% to $1.2049, although trimmed earlier gains after Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said it was possible the central bank had already come to the end of its rate-rising cycle.</p>
      <p>The pound surged 1% at the start of the week after Britain struck a post-Brexit Northern Ireland trade deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. dollar index fell 0.7% to 104.25.</p>
      <p>The index rose nearly 3% in February, its first monthly gain after a four-month losing streak, as a slew of strong U.S. economic data in recent weeks raised market expectations that the Federal Reserve has further to go in hiking rates.</p>
      <p>Futures pricing currently suggests a peak of around 5.4% in the Fed funds rate by September.</p>
      <p>"We see the Fed going to 5.5%, with a growing risk of 6%," said Michael Every, global strategist at Rabobank. "The Fed is hiking. Others can't follow or match. The dollar will soar."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.65% against the Japanese yen to 135.36, having spiked close to 5% against the yen in February, its largest monthly gain since last June.</p>

      <p>Alibaba BABA –0.22%  and other Chinese stocks were rallying on Wednesday after data showed that China is quickly leaving behind the lingering impacts of Covid-19 lockdowns, which spurred a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy last year.</p>
      <p>A key measure of Chinese growth marked its fastest expansion in more than a decade in February, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI ) rising to 52.6 last month from 50.1 in January. The February PMI came ahead of expectations and also marked the highest level since April 2021.</p>
      <p>The PMI data is “the strongest sign yet that demand and supply are being fully restored following the lifting of all Covid restrictions in December,” said Raffi Boyadjian, an analyst at broker XM. “The initial tepid pickup in the economy had raised some concerns about how long it would take for the full effects of the reopening to transpire so it’s very encouraging for investors to see that the recovery is well under way.”</p>

        <p>TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were higher Wednesday after reports on key measures of China manufacturing showed a strong recovery after anti-virus controls were lifted late last year.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 3.3% and Shanghai gained 0.9%.</p>
        <p>Purchasing managers’ indexes issued by a business magazine, Caixin, and the official China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing showed gains in production, exports and new orders.</p>
        <p>Business activity is recovering after the ruling Communist Party ended stringent anti-virus restrictions in early December. That followed a slump in activity that dragged last year’s economic growth to 3%, its second-lowest level since at least the 1970s.</p>
        <p>That was good news in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng gained more than 700 points to 20,486.79.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's own outlook has improved as it also has relaxed pandemic precautions. The territory's chief executive, John Lee, announced Tuesday t hat masks will no longer be required both outdoors and indoors, but some high-risk areas including hospitals and elderly homes can still require their use.</p>
        <p>The Shanghai Composite added 28 points to 3,308.53. South Korean markets were closed for a national holiday.</p>
        <p>Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 picked up 0.3% to 27,523.17. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.1% to 7,263.10.</p>
        <p>Wall Street closed out a frigid February with more losses on Tuesday. The S&P 500 lost 0.3%, locking in a loss of 2.6% for the month and closing at 3,970.15. The Dow fell 0.7% to 32,656.70 while the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower to 11,455.54. Both also sank over the month.</p>
        <p>Investors are keeping an eye on the last of the earnings reports for this season. Several big-name retailers are still on the schedule for this week.</p>
        <p>“The consumer and inflation are in focus over the next few days. After last week’s drubbing among retail stocks, the worst since June last year, some upbeat earnings results from Target should buoy the group,” said Brian Overby, senior market strategist at Ally, while warning that more volatility may be in store later this week.</p>
        <p>After a strong start to the year driven by hopes inflation is abating, Wall Street shifted into reverse in February. A stream of data showed inflation and the overall economy are remaining more resilient than expected. That’s forced investors to raise their forecasts for how high the Federal Reserve will take interest rates and how long it will keep them there.</p>
        <p>High rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession down the line because they hurt the economy. They also drag on prices for stocks and other investments. </p>
        <p>Heightened expectations for rates sent yields jumping in the bond market Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.92%. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that shape the economy’s health, and still near its highest level since November. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, ticked up to 4.81% from 4.78%. It’s near its highest level since 2007.</p>
        <p>Reports on the economy released Tuesday showed some slight cracks. One said that confidence among U.S. consumers fell in February. Another said that manufacturing in the Chicago region weakened by more than expected.</p>
        <p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 48 cents to $77.53 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, rose $0.52 to $83.97 a barrel.</p>
        <p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to $136.37 Japanese yen from $136.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.0596 from $1.0583.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see the Japanese yen pay the price for the Bank of Japan monetary policy. As the 10 year JGB presses 50 basis points, the Bank of Japan has to step in and start printing yen in order to buy bonds. Quite frankly, at this point Japan has no other option but to accept either a weakening currency, or higher interest rates.</p>
      <p>With interest rates around the world climbing overall, it does make a lot of sense the Japanese yen will continue to get hammered as more pressure will be put on the bond market in Tokyo. As the Bank of Japan is the only major central bank in the world offering quantitative easing, the Japanese yen is an easy target for currency traders. With that being the case, not only will the US dollar continue to climb against the Japanese in but is very likely that we will see multiple other currencies do the same. In fact, when you look at the British pound, it is completely ripping the face off of the Japanese yen.</p>
      <p>Just above, the ¥137.50 level is an area that we will need to pay close attention to due to the fact that it was a previous resistance barrier, right along with support. There should be a certain amount of “market memory” in that area, and therefore it’s going to take a significant amount of momentum to break through that area. Short-term pullbacks are very likely, but those will more likely than not end up being buying opportunities.</p>
      <p>The ¥135 level underneath should be support, due to the fact that it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and it is also an area that we have seen quite a bit of noise there in both directions. The 200-Day EMA sits near the ¥134 level, and the 50-Day EMA is getting ready to cross above there in order to form the “golden cross” indicator that a lot of people pay close attention to for a longer-term “buy-and-hold” type of attitude. I have no interest in shorting this pair anytime soon, at least not until the interest rate situation around the world calms down.</p>

      <p>The British pound has skyrocketed against the Japanese yet again during the trading session on Tuesday as we have seen massive amounts of downward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen across the board.

      <h3>British Pound vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has skyrocketed against the Japanese yet again during the trading session on Tuesday as we have seen massive amounts of downward pressure on the value of the Japanese yen across the board. With that being the case, I think this is a market that is now starting to reach a little bit of noise, so perhaps the question now is whether or not we should be switching from the British pound to other currencies against the yen?</p>
      <p>As an example, the New Zealand dollar looks like it’s getting close to breaking out against the Japanese Yen, and while I do believe that the British pound can continue to climb from here, it’s got a lot more noise in the short term to deal with and it has had in the last 48 hours. I certainly wouldn’t short this pair, but I recognize that it has outstretched itself a little bit during the day. With that in mind, I would be cautious, but I would look at pullbacks as a potential buying opportunity.</p>
      <p>Quite frankly, what I would like to see is this market continue to rip higher, because there’s more value to be found in other yen related crosses. For example, the New Zealand dollar, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar all look like they are ready to rip higher against the Japanese yen as well. Simply put, I believe that this chart might be a proxy for what the yen is doing at the moment, because if an overbought condition like this can continue to find buyers, clearly other pairs will have to pay homage to this, and play catch up.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, you need to keep an eye on the fact that we are between the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, because they attract a lot of attention. Typically, when a currency pair is sitting between these 2 indicators, it means that there are probably going to be traders in both directions pushing quite hard. Typically, when you find the market in this range, there is an explosive move sooner or later as one side or the other finally loses.</p>
      <p>If we break above the 50-Day EMA, it’s possible that the market goes looking to the 1.08 level. On the other hand, if we break down below the 200-Day EMA, is very likely that we would see a huge move lower. On a break down below the 200-Day EMA, I suspect that we will eventually go down to the 1.03 level, and then eventually the parity level which of course would be an area that would attract a lot of attention. Keep an eye on the interest rate situation in the United States, because recently the 2 year and the 10 year have seen moves higher in yield.</p>
      <p>That does typically help the US dollar, but ultimately this is a situation where the markets are in flux, and therefore a lot of noisy behavior does make significant sense. The European Central Bank has reiterated its mission to keep inflation down to 2%, but at the same time the Federal Reserve has reiterated its attitude of staying tight for longer. Because of this, a lot of choppiness is more likely than not going to be the case going forward, so therefore position sizing will be crucial.</p>

      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>

      <p>Ethereum’s fee market is slowly returning to form amid a recent resurgence in NFT trading activity across the network.</p>
      <p>According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the median price for gas powering Ethereum transactions cost roughly 10 to 20 gwei over the past 9 months. This month, that cost had risen to 38 gwei—higher than during key bear market events including FTX’s collapse in November (36 gwei) and Binance’s “bank run” in December (24 gwei).</p>
      <p>“The incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway,” wrote Glassnode in its weekly newsletter on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gas prices fluctuate with network demand, meaning costs rise as more users seek to include their transactions in the next Ethereum block. In this case, rising activity in Ethereum’s NFT market appears to be a primary source of the newfound demand for gas.</p>
      <p>You Can Thank NFTs for Falling Ethereum Gas Prices</p>
      <p>Specifically, gas used by Ethereum NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two months straight, approaching levels last seen during the “NFT boom” from mid-2021 to mid-2022. Much of that rising activity is thanks to Blur, an NFT marketplace launched in October that’s now overtaken OpenSea in terms of trading volume.</p>
      <p>“The recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for block space, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559,” explained Glassnode.</p>
      <p>Other drivers of NFT activity include all-new projects launched by the industry’s biggest names, including Yuga Labs’ Dookey Dash game and the announcement of Doodles 2 last month.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Ethereum network adoption rate remains low. The number of new addresses being generated is still 40% below what it was 12 months ago. This suggests that the recent revival in NFT activity has been spurred among existing NFT users, rather than new ones.</p>
      <p>Not all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem are seeing rising revenues. In an interview with Decrypt on Friday, Doodle CEO Julian Holguin said that the competition between OpenSea and Blur is constricting cash available to many NFT projects that relied on secondary royalties for revenue.</p>

        <p>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks edged lower on Tuesday, on track for their biggest February percentage decline in over two decades, as geopolitical risks and fears about U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer cooled demand for riskier assets.</p>
        <p>The MSCI EM equities index slipped 0.5% and was down 6.6% this month, headed for its worst February performance since 2001. A rally in EM stocks at the beginning of 2023 has petered out in recent weeks after signs of strength in the U.S economy fueled fears of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and geopolitical risks including heightened U.S.-China tensions also weighed on sentiment.</p>
        <p>"It's started to get more challenging for emerging markets," said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</p>
        <p>"We think weakness in the global economy will lead to more risk-off in the next few quarters, providing a difficult backdrop."</p>
        <p>Data on Tuesday showed China's urban employment fell for the first time in six decades last year and per capita spending also marked a rare decline, as harsh COVID-19 curbs ravaged the world's second-biggest economy.</p>
        <p>Stocks in China rose 0.6% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 0.8%.</p>
        <p>Regional currencies were muted against a stronger dollar and are set to record their worst month since September 2022.</p>
        <p>The South African rand was down 0.2% ahead of the release of domestic money supply, budget, trade and unemployment data later in the day.</p>
        <p>Russia's rouble was stronger against the U.S. dollar at 74.39. Local media reported that Russia's oil output was back at pre-sactions levels for the first time in February.</p>
        <p>Turkey's lira was flat at 18.8860 after data showed the country's economy expanded 5.6% in 2022, more than expected with growth slowing to 3.5% in the fourth quarter as a decline in demand continued.</p>
        <p>In central and eastern Europe, Hungary's forint edged lower against the euro ahead of an interest rate decision by the country's central bank due later in the day.</p>
        <p>The National Bank of Hungary is widely expected to keep its base rate steady at 13%.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in emerging markets, India's GDP growth likely slowed further in the October-December quarter amid weakening demand and is set to lose more momentum as a series of interest rate hikes weigh on activity, according to a Reuters poll.</p>

        <p>The FTSE 100 and European stocks were mixed this Tuesday as investors reassess the global economy's outlook given expectations for higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 FTSE dropped 0.74% to 7,876.28 points at close of trading on Tuesday, while the CAC 40 FCHI in Paris was muted at 7,291 points. In Germany, the DAX GDAXI was also flat at 15,383.</p>
        <p>Across the pond, US stocks fell Tuesday at the open, rounding out the last day of a volatile month of February on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.34% to 32,775 points. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.31% to 3,980 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) edged lower by 0.21% to 11,472.</p>
        <p>Traders are increasingly worried that central banks around the globe will remain hawkish in order to bring down persistent inflation.</p>
        <p>“Rishi Sunak’s new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland breathed some life back into the pound yesterday, yet the currency gave back some of these gains on Tuesday as markets took time to digest the information," said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.</p>
        <p>"While the deal may provide a reset for UK/EU relations and be good for the UK economy, reports suggest some in the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] are not fully satisfied by what’s on the table.”</p>
        <p>Inflation figures in Spain and France both rose in February while the latest grocery price survey from Kantar in the UK showed food price inflation hit a record high, up 17.1%.</p>

        <p>Back in London, shares in Ocado (OCDO.L) dropped by 7.81%, the top faller on the FTSE 100 index.</p>
        <p>The online supermarket saw its pre-tax loss balloon to nearly £501m last year, nearly three times as high as in 2021.</p>
        <p>The FTSE 100 slipped 0.4% to 7,902, pulled down by poorly received results from Ocado and Croda (CRDA.L), and housebuilders falling in response to Travis Perkins’ cautious outlook in its latest figures.</p>
        <p>The builders’ merchant said it was preparing for ‘more challenged’ private domestic new-build and repair, maintenance and improvement markets.</p>
        <p>Moving in the opposite direction, online electricals retailer AO World (AO.L) was up by 23.38% as it boosted it annual earnings outlook for the third time since November as it said cost-cutting efforts and targeted price rises were paying off.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) rose and was trading at around $83/barrel as demand surged ahead of the release of fresh economic data from China, the world’s largest oil importer and second largest consumer.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 N225 rose 0.1% to 27,445 points, while the Hang Seng HSI in Hong Kong slipped 0.78% to 19,044. The Shanghai Composite edged higher, rising 0.66% to 3,279 points.</p>

      <p>Allianz Investment Management Head ETF Market Strategist Johan Grahn sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss volatility and market performances amid inflation and the Fed's interest rate hike cycle.</p>
      <h3>Video Transcript</h3>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: All right, welcome back to "Yahoo Finance Live." We're going to check on the markets with just a bit before trading closes. Let's see, the Dow falling now 222 points, and check out the S&P and the NASDAQ hovering around the level point. Down just a bit on the S&P, and the NASDAQ just barely in the positive.</p>
      <p>What is ahead for this economy and equities? Let's talk about all of it with Johan Grahn, Allianz Investment Management head ETF market strategist. Nice to see you, sir. Seems like the markets, relatively speaking, holding their breath. What could be the next catalyst around the corner?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, Dave, it's good to see you. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Catalysts? There could be all kinds of catalysts around the corner for you just lurking in the background here. The one thing that we've seen is that we have an environment of increased volatility. And even if it's been coming down a little bit this past week, we're still in a pretty high-volatility environment by historical standards, so to speak.</p>
      <p>So basically it tells you that all the known factors are baked in and that the known factors are bound to swing one way or another, or something new will pop up at any point in time. So it's a good question with a very weak answer for you because it could be a myriad of things.</p>
      <p>SEANA SMITH: Well, Johan, when you take into account what's happening today, where we are at current levels here, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how exactly to play this market given all of that uncertainty that you were just talking about. So what's your advice to those who are trying to decide what now is-- I guess what is best to do right now?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Yeah, it really depends on what kind of time you have. And I mean, frankly, most of the assets are sitting in retirement accounts, as you know. So it's really those investors and Americans that have the least amount of time left in their investing careers, so to speak.</p>
      <p>And what it leads to is a fight against this wealth destruction that the Fed has set out to navigate for us, if you will. And what it comes down to is that you have to be more conservative. You've got to think about how you can keep that wealth as opposed to rallying for the highest potential return.</p>
      <p>And there are various ways you can do it, and I think one of the benefits of the current environment, even though it's a silver lining given the volatility that we're in, is that when you look at this market with higher equity volatility and also higher fixed-income volatility, higher rates, it gives you an opportunity to invest in structured products where you can actually set the definition of what you're looking for, and it gives you more upside given the unit of risk that you're mitigating on the downside in an environment like this.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: Johan, many just feel that the 10 year is really in control and closing their eyes to the equities right now to the highest we've seen since November, 50-plus basis points this month alone. What does it tell you is around the corner?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: Well, the proverbial Fed tactics are always around the corner, as you know. And we're still looking at this environment where you have the Fed consistently telling the market that you are going to have to be more patient and the market reacting and responding consecutively to all this communication. And it's happened over and over and over again. Every time the Fed comes out to have this conversation, the market will try to call the bluff, and then they have to move aside and say, OK, fine. We'll adjust accordingly, and it keeps happening.</p>
      <p>And I think that right now we might be very much closer to the point where the market is, frankly, catching up to what the Fed has been saying all along, and now we're talking about the duration of how long the Fed is going to keep the rates high and how many more hikes they're going to pursue to get there.</p>
      <p>DAVE BRIGGS: And you see no pivot until '24, presumably?</p>
      <p>JOHAN GRAHN: No pivot until '24. The market is still-- there is a little bit of a delta between what the market is pricing in and what the Fed is speaking to the market. But in terms of a real pivot, nothing until 2024 for sure.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether traded little-changed on Tuesday morning in Asia, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell. Polygon led the losers, along with Solana and Shiba Inu. U.S. equities gained ground on Monday after last week’s slump.</p>
      <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin dipped 0.23% in the past 24 hours to trade little changed at US$23,509 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The leading token is holding a seven day loss of 5.34%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum also treaded water at US$1,634, off 0.41%. The token is down 4.05% in the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Polygon’s Matic token posed the biggest drop among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, falling 3.63% to US$1.24, and extending its weekly loss to 16.27%. Polygon Labs, the developer of the Polygon blockchain, said last week it would lay off 20% of its workforce, which was followed by a reported glitch on Polygon’s network.</li>
        <li>Solana lost 2.43% to US$22.69, posting a weekly loss of 13.41%. Solana developers are investigating a network failure on the Solana Mainet Beta last Saturday, which forced it to restart the network and downgrade it from a recent update.</li>
        <li>Shiba Inu dropped 2.53% after analytics firm Lookonchain reported a wallet moving 182 billion Shiba Inu tokens to crypto exchanges on Monday, usually the sign of preparation for selling that can drive prices lower. Last time the same wallet transferred over 200 billion Shiba Inu in December 2022 the price fell more than 7% on the day, according to Lookonchain. The token is down 7.21% for the seven day period.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization edged 0.15% lower to US$1.07 trillion, while the total trading volume jumped 34.55% over the past 24 hours to US$45.70 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities edged higher on Monday after last week’s tumble on concerns about indicators showing inflation remains entrenched. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.22%, the S&P 500 gained 0.31% and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.63%.</li>
        <li>Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, told CNN on Monday that U.S. inflation remains too high, but the economy can achieve a soft landing. She said the Federal Reserve’s attempt to curb inflation through higher interest rates while maintaining a strong labor market appears achievable.</li>
        <li>U.S. interest rates are now between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. The January Federal Reserve meeting minutes released last Wednesday showed policymakers agreed to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes, but warned the tightening cycle is not over.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Census Bureau announced its latest monthly report on durable goods on Monday, with orders for manufactured goods – excluding transportation – rising 0.7% in January, or below expectations in a sign of a slowdown in the growth that has been feeding inflation.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict a 76.7% likelihood the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points in March. They also predict a 23.3% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 27.7% as reported on Monday.</li>

      <p>The US dollar has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously.

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has pulled back slightly during the trading session on Monday but continues look very strong as it is a very minor pullback but should also be noted that the market was relatively quiet, especially considering just how bullish it had been previously. Because of this, it looks as if the market is going to try to go to the ¥137.50 level, an area that previously had been significant resistance. If we can break above there, then it’s possible that the market could go to the ¥140 level.</p>
      <p>If we pull back from here, the ¥135 level courses a large, round, psychologically significant figure, in an area that previously had been resistance. The fact that we broke above there should now have “market memory” attached to it, suggesting that there should be plenty of value hunters in that general vicinity. The Bank of Japan continues to keep interest rates low and fight 10 year yields from rising above 50 basis points.</p>
      <p>In order to do so they will have to continue to print yen in order to buy their own bonds in Japan. In other words, if rates start to rise again, that will only help the US dollar clobber the Japanese yen. You can also see that the Japanese yen is getting the same treatment almost everywhere, so this is most certainly a Japanese Yen situation more than it is a US dollar situation.</p>
      <p>Looking at this chart, I do think that the trend is starting to change, so I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we try to reach towards the top again as the Bank of Japan has dug in its heels when it comes to yield curve control and has reiterated multiple times that it was going to be stuck in it. At the same time, we have the Federal Reserve making it abundantly clear that it is going to stay “tighter for longer”, meaning that monetary policy in the United States will be much more restrictive than many other economies around the world, thereby making the US dollar attractive.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea. The 1.21 level features the 50-Day EMA and the 200-Day EMA indicators, which of course a lot of people pay close attention to. Because of this, the market is more likely than not going to continue to be very noisy but seems to have a short-term ceiling due to those indicators. Any rally at this point in time more likely than not should be sold into, on the first signs of exhaustion.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we break down below the hammer from last week, it’s very likely that we could go looking to the 1.18 level, an area that really looks supported a while back, and it’s also an area we had launched from to enter the consolidation area that we had been in for a while. If we break down below that level, then it’s like a trapdoor opening, allowing the British pound to fall quite drastically. It does make a certain amount of sense, due to the fact that the US dollar continues to strengthen across the board, so there’s really no reason to think that the British pound will be any different.</p>
      <p>Granted, the Bank of England has recently had to deal with a lot of inflation and therefore monetary policy may remain tight longer than anticipated, but at the same time you can certainly take that same attitude towards the Federal Reserve, and of course the Federal Reserve will get what it wants given enough time.</p>
      <p>It seems traders are just now starting to come to grips with the idea that the Federal Reserve is going to remain “tighter for longer”, as inflation simply is going nowhere in the United States. There’s a high demand for US dollars currently, as interest rates around the world continue to climb, and world governments have to pay back US dollar denominated debt. I like fading rallies at the first signs of exhaustion.</p>

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen a bit early during the trading session on Monday to touch the 200-Day EMA. The market bounced from that level to turn around and show signs of life, and now threatens the 1.06 level. It’ll be interesting to see whether or not this happens, due to the fact that there is so much downward pressure on the major currencies that are not the US dollar. The US dollar breaking higher due to the fact that people have struggled with risk appetite, and of course the fact that interest rates on the 2 year yield in America continue to climb, despite the fact that Wall Street believes that the Federal Reserve will eventually come and bail them out.</p>
      <p>The Euro of course has its own issues, not the least of which will be the fact that the economy is running into significant headwinds, but at the same time has a certain amount of inflation. Because of this, the Euro is not ready to go down without a fight but at the end of the day one of the main things that has this market somewhat levitated is the fact that Christine Lagarde has stated repeatedly that an inflation target of 2% is crucial. Nonetheless, if we continue to see a lot of negativity out there when it comes to risk appetite, the Euro will more likely than not start to sell off yet again.</p>
      <p>If we can break down below the 200-Day EMA, then the 1.05 level will be targeted. Anything below there then opens up the possibility of a move to the 1.04 level, and then possibly the 1.0250 level. After that, we have the possibility of going down to the parity level. The parity level of course will attract a lot of headlines, and therefore could be a noisy affair. The alternative scenario would be breaking above the 1.07 level, which would open up a potential move to the 1.08 level. That is where the massive selloff begins from a couple of weeks ago and therefore, I think that as long as we have the same fundamental situation, rallies are more likely than not going to be sold into.</p>
      <p>The British pound has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, suggesting that we are going to try to break above the 1.20 level again. This is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that the market continues to struggle with this idea.

      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level. By doing so, it suggests that the Aussie is going to continue to see a lot of negativity, and that of course makes a certain amount of sense due to the fact that the global economy seems to be slowing down. Remember, the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to global growth, as the Australian economy is so highly leveraged not only mainland China, but also commodity trading in general.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday, reaching down to touch the crucial 0.67 level. By doing so, it suggests that the Aussie is going to continue to see a lot of negativity, and that of course makes a certain amount of sense due to the fact that the global economy seems to be slowing down. Remember, the Australian dollar is highly sensitive to global growth, as the Australian economy is so highly leveraged not only mainland China, but also commodity trading in general. As long as there are concerns of a global slowdown, it does make a certain amount of sense that the Aussie will struggle. Furthermore, the 50-Day EMA is starting to roll over, and is getting ready to break down below the 200-Day EMA, a negative technical indicator known as a “death cross.”</p>
      <p>In the area of 0.67, there is a significant amount of support. Because of this, short-term bounce would not be huge price, but that should more likely than not have a lot of people jumping into the market to short the Aussie again, in order to pick up “cheap US dollars.” If we break down below all the noise just below the 0.67 level, then it’s likely that the market would go looking to the 0.6450 level given enough time.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if we were to turn around and breakout above the moving averages above, then the market could go looking to the 0.70 level. The 0.70 level is obviously a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we’ve seen a lot of selling recently. Nonetheless, I do think that this pullback is rather significant, and could get the market really selling off if we get more “risk off behavior” around the world. Regardless of what happens next, we are at an inflection point, and therefore it’s likely that we will see a lot of choppy and noisy trading in this general vicinity.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>Tokens of Shiba Inu-themed Floki can soon be used as collateral to borrow a basket of cryptocurrencies on Venus Protocol, the second-largest lending platform on the BNB Chain, Floki developers told CoinDesk on Friday.</p>
      <p>The move is part of a broader plan to make FLOKI, which was originally a meme coin named after billionaire Elon Musk's pet dog, as a serious decentralized-finance token.</p>
      <p>Venus provides a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing product that allows users to directly borrow against collateral at a high speed while losing less to transaction fees. It held over $800 million in locked tokens as of Friday.</p>
      <p>Venus will be integrating FLOKI in its money-market platform, thereby allowing FLOKI holders on the BNB Chain to borrow USDT, USDC, BNB and a basket of other cryptocurrencies while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
      <p>This allows FLOKI token holders to easily access liquidity without having to sell their tokens.</p>
      <p>The move is expected to benefit FLOKI holders, developers say, as they continue to build and seek strategic partnerships that ultimately benefit the token’s value.</p>
      <p>The FLOKI integration process on Venus has started, and is expected to be completed in March. After that, FLOKI holders will be able to seamlessly lend and borrow on Venus while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.</p>
      <p>FLOKI has so far been one of the strongest crypto performers this year, tripling in value over a 30-day rolling period, according to CoinGecko. Interest in the tokens has heightened in recent months following a $100 million token burn and a push to target Valhalla, Floki’s metaverse game, to the multibillion-dollar Chinese gaming market.</p>

      <p>A customer hands Indian currency notes to an attendant at a fuel station in Mumbai</p>
      <p>By Nimesh Vora</p>
      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian rupee rose against the dollar on Thursday, helped by a broad recovery in Asian currencies following losses fuelled by worries over rising U.S. yields.</p>
      <p>The rupee was at 82.77 to the U.S. dollar by 10:29 a.m. IST, up from 82.85 in the previous session. Following the higher opening, the local currency has been in a three-paisa range.</p>
      <p>The rupee, it can be safely assumed, will stick to the 82.80 level through the session, a currency dealer at a private sector bank said. Volumes are likely to be on the lower side and speculative interest will be minimal, he said.</p>
      <p>The Korean won, the Asian currency worst impacted by the market's ongoing reassessment of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike path, lead the recovery against the dollar on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was up 0.8% while others rose 0.2% to 0.3%. The dollar index declined slightly.</p>
      <p>The Fed minutes released overnight noted that almost all participants preferred a 25 basis points (bps) hike at the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 Fed meeting, and a few would have liked a 50 bps hike.</p>
      <p>However, the minutes did not have a significant impact on Asian currencies, as they were considered "outdated". Since the Fed's February meeting, there has been a series of data points on inflation and economic activity that surprised the market.</p>
      <p>We’ve already been hearing from some Fed officials that they may be open to up the size of the rate hikes and that a higher terminal rate may be needed, Scotiabank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Risk appetite in Asia was better, weighing on demand for the dollar. Asian shares were mostly higher and futures indicated a positive opening for U.S. equities. Oil prices inched up, recovering from two-week lows.</p>

      <p>On-chain liquidity and derivatives trading protocol Synthetix has deployed version 3 (v3) on the Ethereum mainnet following security audits, developers said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Synthetix (SNX) is a protocol that enables the issuance of synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain – allowing users to mint, hold, and trade a wide range of derivatives – including commodities, fiat currencies, and even stocks.</p>
      <p>The protocol holds over $450 million in locked tokens over the Ethereum and Optimism blockchains as of Thursday. It held just shy of $3 billion in total locked value (TVL) at its February 2021 record high.</p>
      <p>Developers previously stated said that Synthetix v3 will have much more efficient architecture to allow developers to create faster, complex and more efficient decentralized financial (DeFi) applications.</p>
      <p>V3 will allow the creation of products that offer a liquid market for any financial derivative that developers want to build, from traditional financial markets to more exotic markets such as no-loss lotteries or even wholly separate protocols.</p>
      <p>V3 will also offer simplified staking and differentiated debt pools, allowing network stakers to supply collateral to, and receive fees from, specific asset pools without having to be exposed to every Spartan Council-supported asset.</p>
      <p>The Spartan Council (SC) is the central governing body of the Synthetix protocol that votes on overall improvement proposals and parameter changes.</p>
      <p>Synthetix’s native SNX tokens saw nominal price changes in the past 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Intel INTC reported Q4 results after market close yesterday. The world’s largest chipmaker missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers.</p>
      <p>As such, shares of INTC plunged about 10% in after-market hours. Given this, ETFs like First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund TDIV, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK, and Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJD having the highest allocation to the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, will be in focus.</p>
      <h3>Q4 Earnings in Focus</h3>
      <p>Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and the year-ago earnings of $1.09. Revenues declined 32% year over year to $14 billion and came in above the estimated $14.5 billion.</p>
      <p>Client computing, data-center and AI, and network and edge revenues declined 36%, 33% and 1%, respectively. However, accelerated computing systems and graphics, Intel Foundry Services and Mobileye revenues were up 1%, 30% and 59%, respectively (see: all the Technology ETFs here).</p>
      <p>The chipmaker continued to suffer from dismal PC and data-center markets. Shoppers choose to hold on to the laptops and desktops they purchased at the peak of the pandemic. According to Gartner, Q4 worldwide PC shipments declined 28.5%, the biggest decline since the firm started following shipments in the mid-1990s.</p>
      <p>As such, Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share. Both revenue and earnings per share guidance are well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion and 26 cents per share, respectively.</p>
      <h3>ETFs to Tap</h3>
      <h3>First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV)</h3>
      <p>First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund provides exposure to dividend payers within the technology sector by tracking the Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index.

      <p>The semiconductor space has been surging over the past three months on improving demand from chips suppliers, data centers, PC manufacturers, and mobile phone producers, as well as reopening in China. However, mixed quarterly results from well-known players slowed down the rally in the sector lately (read: Is the Worst Over for Semiconductor Stocks & ETFs?).</p>
      <p>While Intel INTC and Qualcomm QCOM disappointed investors, Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research Corporation LRCX and Advanced Micro Devices AMD came up with solid earnings reports. As such, semiconductor ETFs remained strong over the past month with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL rising 12.8%, 12.7%, 12.4%, 10.4% and 8.7%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Let’s dig into the individual performances:</p>
      <h3>Semiconductor Earnings in Focus</h3>
      <p>Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers. Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and revenues of $14 billion also came in below the estimated $14.5 billion. Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share (read: Intel Plunges on Earnings Miss, Weak Guidance: ETFs in Focus).</p>
      <p>Texas Instruments reported solid Q4 results topping our earnings estimate by 17 cents and revenue estimate by $84 million. For first-quarter 2023, the company expects revenues in the range of $4.17-$4.53 billion and earnings per share of $1.64-$1.90.</p>
      <p>Lam Research also topped on both revenue and earnings for second-quarter fiscal 2023. Earnings per share of $10.71 strongly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 76 cents, while revenues of $5.28 billion edged past the estimated $5.08 billion. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects revenues of $3.8 billion (+/- $300 million) and earnings per share of $6.50 (+/- 75 cents).</p>
      <p>Advanced Micro Devices beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings by three cents and on revenues by $58 million. It expects first-quarter 2023 revenues of $5.3 billion (+/-$300 million), which indicates a year-over-year decline of 10%.</p>
      <p>At Qualcomm, earnings per share of $2.37 for first-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents, while revenues of $9.46 billion fell short of the estimate of $9.56 billion. The company projects revenues of $8.7-$9.5 billion and earnings per share of $2.05-$2.25 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>

      <h3>British Pound vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The British pound has pulled back just a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, as we have seen quite a bit of volatility. Again. The 50-Day EMA has been offering resistance, and of course the 200-Day EMA also is an area where we have seen the light of pressure as well. Now that we have pulled back a bit, it’s likely that we continue to see a lot of noise between here and the 1.20 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that a lot of people will be paying attention to. Furthermore, the 1.20 level is an area where we had seen quite a bit of support previously, so I think everything comes together quite nicely for that being a bit of the support barrier.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 1.20 level, then it’s likely that we go down to the 1.1850 level. The 1.1850 level course was a swing low, and I believe that will be the bottom of the uptrend. In other words, if we break down below there, it’s likely that we drop down to the 1.15 level as it should open up a bit of a vacuum. The shooting star from last week suggests that we have a lot of resistance just above near the 1.2250 level, so if we were to break above there it opens up the possibility of a double top, which is at the 1.24 level, with resistance extending all the way to the 1.25 level. Now that we have formed a double top in that area, one would have to believe that it is going to continue to be a very important level.</p>
      <p>If we were to break above all of that resistance, then it would continue the overall uptrend in the British pound, and as things stand right now it looks like we are essentially close to the bottom of the consolidation area. However, I would point out that the price action over the last several weeks has been somewhat soft, and therefore one would have to believe that all it would take is a kick to the market to knock it over and have a go lower.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar has initially tried to rally during the week, but then sold off quite drastically. At this point, it looks like the Aussie is getting ready to break through significant support, near the 0.67 level. Quite frankly, there’s a lot of risk out there and it makes a lot of sense that the Aussie would be a victim. The US dollar will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, but then again quite a bit of strength due to the fact that the Federal Reserve remains very tight with its monetary policy, and of course the Australian dollar has issues due to the fact that it is so highly levered to global growth.</p>
      <p>When you look at this chart, you can see that we bounced rather hard from the 0.62 level, to test the 50% Fibonacci level and the 200-Week EMA indicator. Since then, we have seen a lot of negativity and it looks to me as if the market is trying to continue the longer term downtrend. With this being the case, you may wish to flip down to shorter-term charts that show signs of a bounce, and then take advantage of those bounces as selling opportunities with the end goal of going down to the 0.66 level, maybe even as low as 0.62 level if things get out of hand and a major “risk off environment.”</p>
      <p>As far as buying is concerned, quite frankly would take something coming out of the Federal Reserve along the lines of a complete reversal of attitude for me to think about doing that. This week’s candle has been very clear in its intentions.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether fell in Wednesday morning trading in Asia along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon saw the biggest drop, while BNB dropped the least. A series of economic data in the U.S. released on Tuesday, including earnings reports from retail giants and the rising rate of some Treasury bills, weighed down on equity markets.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin fell 1.6% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$24,442 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, though it was still up 10% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum fell 2.6% to US$1,658, rising 6.5% over the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Polygon lost 6.1% to US$1.39, though it still booked 10% gains over the past seven days. BNB fell 1.2% to US$311.48, but was still up 5.2% for the week.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.8% to US$1.11 trillion at 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The total trading volume over the past 24 hours was up by 3.3% to US$66.70 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday, which was the first trading day of the week, as markets closed on Monday for President’s Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%, the S&P 500 Index dropped 2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day down 2.5%.</li>
        <li>The three key indices posted the biggest single-day losses since Dec. 15 as the S&P 500 cut its year-to-date gains in half while the Dow Jones wiped out almost all of its 2023 gains.</li>
        <li>The two-year Treasury note yield rose to 4.7% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 3.9%. Elevated levels in Treasury bond yields represent a larger upside risk for yields, placing downward pressure on equities.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 policy meeting on Wednesday, which investors will look to for hints on how the central bank may act to tackle inflation.</li>
        <li>Retail giants Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc., released their holiday season earnings reports on Tuesday. Walmart’s revenue rose 7.3% to US$164 billion from the previous year, while Home Depot fell short of expectations, reporting US$35 billion in Q4 revenue. Both companies projected a challenging quarter ahead due to headwinds from supply chain shortages and ongoing inflation in the economy.</li>
        <li>Economic data released on Tuesday suggested that business activity in the U.S. is expanding. The S&P Global services purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to an 8-month high of 50.5 in February, up from 46.8 in the previous month, while the manufacturing PMI rose to a four-month high of 47.8 from 46.9.</li>
        <li>The Fed raised interest rates to the range of 4.5%-4.75% on Feb.1 to fight the inflation, the highest level since October 2007, with the latest Consumer Price Index data up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict a roughly 75% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

      <h3>Coinbase (COIN)</h3>
      <p>Coinbase Global shares jumped after the crypto exchange’s fourth-quarter revenue of $629.1 million came in above Wall Street expectations of $581.1 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg .</p>
      <p>The bar was set relatively low for Coinbase amid a sharp fall in trading volumes last quarter following a decline in crypto prices, the collapse of FTX.com, and increased regulatory scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“Coinbase and crypto proved to be largely resilient in 2022 despite major shocks to the system,” read the company’s shareholder letter. “Idiosyncratic events throughout 2022 exacerbated already weak macro conditions.”</p>
      <p>Coinbase slashed about 20% of its staff in January. The company says it expects a decrease in expenses of more than 30% given its reduced headcount.</p>
      <p>Coinbase shares, which lost about two-thirds of their value over the last year, have rallied sharply since the start of 2023, up roughly 80%. The rise comes amid a resurgence in the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which currently hovers above $24,300 per token.</p>
      <h3>Palo Alto Networks (PANW)</h3>
      <p>Palo Alto Networks’ total revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2023 grew 26% year over year to $1.7 billion. Shares of the cybersecurity firm rallied in after hours.</p>
      <p>"We continue to see our teams execute well in the midst of macroeconomic challenges, helping customers consolidate their security architectures," said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date shares of the Palo Alto-based firm are up about 20% amid an overall rise in tech equities. Cybersecurity firms held up relatively well last year compared to the rest of technology stocks, as demand for keeping networks safe grows amid rising geo-political tensions.</p>
      <h3>Caesars Entertainment (CZR)</h3>
      <p>Caesars Entertainment posted fourth quarter net revenue of $2.8 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.</p>
      <p>The gambling company’s results were positively impacted by a continued consumer shift towards spending in services and experiences, from goods.</p>
      <p>"Our fourth quarter delivered another set of strong operating results as both our Las Vegas and Regional segments each set a new fourth quarter record for Adjusted EBITDA,” Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars Entertainment said in the company’s earnings release.</p>
      <h3>Toll Brothers (TOL)</h3>
      <p>Toll Brothers posted first-quarter earnings per share of $1.70 compared to $1.24 for the same period last year. The home builder also gave upbeat guidance after the housing market started to slow down last year.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/stocks-moving.png" alt="ncx-stocks"/>
      <p>“Since the start of the calendar year, we have seen a marked increase in demand beyond normal seasonality as buyer confidence appears to be improving,” Douglas Yearley, Jr., chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers, said in the company's earnings release.</p>
      <p>Toll Brothers reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance for an adjusted gross margin of 27% and an earnings per share range between $8.00 and $9.00.</p>
      <p>U.S. existing home sales fell to the lowest level in more than 12 years in January, according to a report released by the National Association of Realtors. However the pace of decline slowed, signaling the housing market slowdown could could soon be bottoming.</p>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has pulled back a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as we continue to see a lot all volatility in this pair. We are hanging around the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that a lot of people pay attention to. Because of this, I think it makes quite a bit of sense that we would see choppy behavior. The 0.69 level being in the same general vicinity probably as to the volatility as well, so it is worth pointing that out also.</p>
      <p>All things being equal, we have to ask whether or not this is an area where the Australian dollar is going to see a little bit of support, or if we are going to continue to see negativity. A lot of this will come down to the interest-rate markets, and whether or not traders are starting to focus on tight monetary policy in the United States, or if they are going to focus more on the China reopening situation. After all, the Australian dollar is highly levered to the Chinese economy and of course the demand for Aussie commodities.</p>
      <p>The global growth situation is tenuous at best, but a lot of traders are starting to pin their hopes on China pulling everybody through. If that’s the case, then Australia will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. However, if this market were to break down below the hammer from the Friday session, I suspect at that point we will see further selling pressure on the Aussie dollar, sending it toward the 0.67 level. Regardless, I would anticipate a lot of choppy behavior, but it is worth noting that we have recently seen a significant selloff from the 0.7150 level that has yet to be truly challenged.</p>

      <p>The token has risen nearly 50% to $0.60 in the past 24 hours, taking the month-to-date gain to 125%. Prices were quoted as high as $0.84 early Monday, the highest since May, CoinDesk data show. Meanwhile, market leader bitcoin (BTC) has risen just 6% this month.</p>
      <p>The outsized move comes as the crypto community goes gaga over Ordinals, which went live on Jan. 21, allowing users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, Ordinals are like drawing artwork directly on satoshi (sats), the lowest denomination of a bitcoin, while NFTs on Ethereum are analogous to an authenticity certificate from the creator that is separate from ether.</p>
      <p>The number of newly created Ordinals or NFTs inscribed directly into Satoshis on Bitcoin crossed the 100,000 mark last week, causing network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
      <p>Per Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, the growing popularity of Ordinals would bode well for layer 2 solutions.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals on Bitcoin L1 are complementary to Bitcoin NFTs on L2s like Stacks. Ordinals have a natural limit on the L1 scale, and L2s provide a clear scalability path," Ali tweeted Monday. "Wallets like Xverse and & Hiro are amongst the first to release or work on Ordinals."</p>
      <p>Activity in NFTs on Stacks has picked up in the wake of the Ordinals' rising popularity. Data from DappRadar shows trading volume on Gamma.io, a Stack-based Bitcoin NFT marketplace, has increased by more than 1,000% in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, volumes on Megapont have increased by 125%. Per data tweeted by Ali, there is an active community of artists and creators on Stacks and people have minted 650K Bitcoin NFTs on the layer 2 solution.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals NFT on Bitcoin blockchain has been very successful, leading to a general Bitcoin NFT fever," CK Cheung, investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, said. "Stacks is a beneficiary of this as it is an L2 supporting smart contracts built on top of the Bitcoin Network. People could mint new Bitcoin NFTs on top of Stacks with a lower cost and higher speed."</p>
      <p>Last week, the bitcoin-focused Web 3 wallet Xverse rolled out support for Ordinals. At the same time, Hiro Wallet added support for inscriptions on its testnet, with Ali describing the same as Metamask for Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Early this month, Gamma.io unveiled a no-code creator platform for NFTs on native Bitcoin through the use of ordinals, opening doors for users to create inscriptions without having to run a full Bitcoin node or write any code. Gamma's new launch essentially made Ordinals accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p>"Ordinals (inscriptions) are similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the smallest value of Bitcoin (satoshis). This is now opening up the use case for NFTs and merging them with the Bitcoin network security layer," Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in an email while pointing to the upcoming "Building on Bitcoin Hackathon" as the key event to watch out for in the short term.</p>
      <p>The hackathon, scheduled from Feb. 24 to March 7, will have participants build their own smart contracts using Clarity, programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.</p>
      <p>"This virtual hackathon is driving a lot of attention as Stacks uses 'Clarity,' a programming language for writing smart contracts that might be easier to learn than Solidity. The hackathon will reveal in the next two weeks if everybody can now build smart contracts without too much technical knowledge," Thielen noted.</p>
      <p>Finally, on top of all this, STX is seemingly drawing a haven bid, according to Dubai-based crypto analyst and trader Reetika Malik.</p>
      <p>"STX is also one of the rare tokens approved by the SEC. So in these uncertain times when the regulator is going after a lot of crypto companies, an SEC-approved token also sounds like a good thing to the market," Malik said.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether prices rose in Tuesday afternoon trade in Asia, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. XRP led gains at 2.37%, while Solana and Polygon dropped saw the largest declines. Bitcoin returned to the US$25,000 price level a day after it became the 11th largest asset in the world, surpassing payments giant Visa’s market cap.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin (BTC) gained 1.97% to US$25,002 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, and has gained 14.79% on the week. Ether inched up 0.46% to US$1,704, gaining 13.2% over the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
        <li>“BTC repeated its March 2020 downside wicking depth below the 200-day MA (moving average),” wrote pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital, adding that Bitcoin will rally once it reclaims the 200-day MA as support, which is around US$25,000.</li>
        <li>XRP rose the most, gaining 2.37% to US$0.3998, and strengthened 7.85% on the week. Ripple Labs, which developed the Ripple payment network powered by XRP, said on Monday it is hiring engineers and has about 75 open positions.</li>
        <li>Solana dropped the most among top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos, by 1.78% to US$26, but gained 23.84% in the last seven days. Polygon’s Matic fell 1.46% to US$1.47, but strengthened 24.54% on the week.</li>
        <li>Asian markets were mixed on Tuesday. The Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.12% while the Shanghai Composite strengthened by 0.49%.</li>
        <li>“While the current macroeconomic environment may cast a shadow over global exports, and the Fed may still continue with its rate hikes, China’s domestic demand remains robust,” Jack Lee, China A-shares fund manager of Schroders, said.</li>
        <li>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.71% at Tuesday’s close while Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.21%.</li>
        <li>European shares declined in anticipation of Eurozone manufacturing and services activity data and the ZEW economic sentiment index. Germany’s DAX 40 retreated 0.2% while Stoxx 600 fell 0.3%.</li>
        <li>Investors are anticipating the minutes of the meeting of U.S. Federal Reserve, which would shed light on the direction of the economy and interest rates. The central bank has been consistently increasing interest rates since last year and is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points next month. Currently, interest rates in the world’s largest economy stand at 4.5% to 4.75%, and Fed officials had earlier said that may increase to as high as 5%.</li>

      <h3>Australian Dollar vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Australian dollar has rallied a bit during the trading session on Monday, breaking above the 50-Day EMA, near the 0.69 level. 0.69 level has been important more than once, so it does make a certain amount of sense that we would see noise there. As we have broken above that moving average, we also saw a bit of downward pressure, so now it looks as if the market is trying to figure out what it wants to do for a longer-term move.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the Australian dollar will be highly levered to commodities, and of course the idea of global growth. With China reopening, there is a bit of hope, but it also is probably worth noting that the global economy itself looks a bit shaky to say the least. The market had recently rallied all the way to the 50% Fibonacci level, only to start selling off quite drastically. Those impulsive candlesticks above should continue to weigh heavy upon the market, especially if we see commodities lose some steam.</p>
      <p>It is probably worth noting that the hammer from the Friday trading session is a candlestick that you should be paying close attention to, because if we were to break down below there, it would be a serious breach of support. Not only would we be breaking down below the hammer, and also the 200-Day EMA, an indicator that will attract a lot of attention by systematic traders. To the upside, I think that the 0.70 level will continue to be a bit of the ceiling, as it is psychologically important, and we have seen a lot of action in that area.</p>
      <p>It is worth noting that inflation is still an issue in both Australia and the United States, so the interest rate situation between the 2 currencies may not be as clear as others, but as a general rule of the dollar tends to move in one direction against all currencies. In other words, you can pay attention to multiple currency pairs, and notice the overall direction of the dollar in order to trade this market.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has gone back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Monday, as the market still looks at the ¥135 level as a potential resistance barrier. That being said, the market also is sitting just above the crucial 200-Day EMA, so the question will be whether or not it can offer support. The 50-Day EMA sits underneath there and is trying to curl back to the upside so I would anticipate quite a bit of noisy behavior. The market has been repudiated at the ¥135 level, but if he can break above there it has a clear shot to the ¥137.50 level.</p>
      <p>If we can break above there, then the market can continue to go much higher. All things being equal, this is a situation where we see a lot of volatility over the next several days as the Bank of Japan continues to fight higher interest rates, meaning that they will be printing more Japanese yen, thereby driving down the value of that currency. On the other side of the equation, you have the Federal Reserve keeping a very tight monetary policy, so thereby offering a bit of support to the US dollar, despite the fact that may not necessarily be their intention. As long as there is a huge amount of inflation in the United States, that will be a continuous issue.</p>
      <p>It may also be worth noting that the market had recently bounced from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, so that is something that a lot of technical traders will pay close attention to. Beyond that, the ¥127.50 level was where that 50% Fibonacci level showed up, and of course it’s also an area that previously had seen support. With all that, it’s very possible this may remain a “buy on the dips” type of market.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin fell 2.76% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$23,927 as of 9:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still up 11.9% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum lost 0.97% to US$1,661, and has gained 11.2% over the past seven days.</li>
        <li>Solana was up 4.6% to US$24.62, a weekly gain of 15.6%. The network has been holding its “Build through the Bear” hackathon this month, which invites community members to build on the blockchain, offering US$50,000 in USDC for the top prize. The hackathon ends on March 14.</li>
        <li>Dogecoin fell 2% to US$0.087, but was still trading up 6.6% over the past seven days. XRP slipped 1.7% to US$0.38, though was still trading 3% higher for the past week.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization reached US$1.13 trillion overnight, the highest since August 2022, before falling to US$1.12 trillion at 9:15 a.m. in Hong Kong. The total trading volume over the past 24 hours was up by 14.4% to US$54.9 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equities had a mixed day of trading on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, but the S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index closed the day down 0.6%. Wall Street will be closed on Monday for Presidents’ Day.</li>
        <li>Many major U.S. retailers are slated to release their holiday season earnings this week, starting with Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. on Tuesday.</li>
        <li>The earning reports are set to come amid growing recessionary concerns in the U.S., as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates from near zero to 4.5% to 4.75% to tamp down on inflation. While some have criticized the Fed for raising rates too sharply, the central bank maintains it will be able to achieve a soft landing” to bring down inflation without triggering a recession.</li>
        <li>The latest Consumer Price Index data showed that inflation was up 6.4% in January from a year ago, down from 6.5% in December and 7.1% in November.</li>
        <li>Analysts at the CME Group predict an 85% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month.</li>

      <p>Bitcoin is heading into a quiet week in terms of macroeconomic triggers that could affect the price. There are a few US data releases, such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, coming up.</p>
      <p>All eyes are on the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting being held on 15 and 16 March where a decision for the next benchmark interest rate hike will be made.

      <h3>Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The Euro has fallen again against the US dollar during the trading session on Friday, as we continue to see a lot of negativity out there in general. Keep in mind that the US dollar will be the first place people run to for safety in this environment, so it’s probably worth noting that we have seen more of a “risk off” move around the world during the day.</p>
      <p>The Euro has seen a lot of action at 1.06, but I suspect it is only a minor support level, perhaps opening up the possibility of a challenge of the 1.05 level, which is much more important in the sense that it was a swing low, and of course the 200-Day EMA sitting in that same area has a huge effect as well. Because of this, I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we see that area challenged, especially as we have seen a couple of impulsive negative moves over the last couple of weeks. With this, I think the real battle begins in that area.</p>
      <p>If we were to break down below the 200-Day EMA on a daily close, then I think you could have a situation where the Euro gets hit really hard. At that point, it would not surprise me at all to see the Euro go down to parity again. On the other hand, if we turn around and take out the shooting star from the Tuesday session, it opens up a move to the 1.10 level above, but that area looks extraordinarily difficult to break higher than, due to the fact that we had seen so much massive selling at what is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and the 50% Fibonacci level from the big move lower.</p>

      <h3>US Dollar vs Japanese Yen Weekly Technical Analysis</h3>
      <p>The US dollar has rallied during the course of the week to test the ¥135 level. The ¥135 level of course is an area that has been important multiple times, so it’s not a huge surprise to see that we have failed there. Nonetheless, the overall candlestick is rather bullish looking, and therefore I think we probably have a little bit of follow-through coming. After all, if the Bank of Japan continues to have to fight interest rates, it’s likely that we will continue to see the US dollar overcome the Japanese yen strength. We also had recently pulled back from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and now it looks like we are ready to go to the upside again. Given enough time, I do think that we probably have a much higher exchange rate.</p>
      <p>If we can break above the ¥135 level, then it is possible that we could go to the ¥137.50 level. After that, the ¥140 level is worth paying close attention to. On the other hand, if we turn around and break down below the ¥130 level, that would probably show quite a bit of negativity, perhaps opening up the possibility of a move down to the ¥127.50 level. You can see that the pullback was rather brutal, but then again, the move higher was brutal to get up there. Now that the Federal Reserve may finally be convincing people that they are serious about keeping interest rates higher for longer, we could very well see this market take off to the upside. Ultimately, this is a market that remains very noisy, but I do think given enough time we probably try to get back to those highs at this rate.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Binance secretly moved large sums of money from its supposedly independent US partner to a company managed by the crypto giant's boss Changpeng Zhao, according to Reuters</p>
      <p>The publication said Thursday that Binance's US partner started transferring money to Merit Peak in 2020 and sent the trading firm over $400 million in the first quarter of 2021, citing banking records and company messages.</p>
      <p>Merit Peak is a market-maker trading firm owned by Binance CEO Zhao, who's often referred to by his initials CZ.</p>
      <p>Binance claims that Merit Peak and Binance's US partner Binance.US operate independently from the global exchange, which CZ co-founded in 2017.</p>
      <p>But Binance.US executives didn't know that it had been sending money to Merit Peak and were concerned when this came to light, according to company messages seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>Then-CEO Catherine Coley reportedly asked a Binance executive for an explanation in late 2020, calling the transfers "unexpected" and saying that "no one mentioned them".</p>
      <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has previously probed ties between Binance.US, Merit Peak, and another CZ-owned trading firm called Sigma Chain AG, according to a Wall Street Journal report published in February 2022.</p>
      <p>Binance.US did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment.</p>
      <p>It's not clear why the money was sent from Binance.US to Merit Peak or if any of the funds belonged to US customers.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported in November that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had used at least $4 billion of customers' money to prop up Alameda Research, a supposedly independent trading firm that he managed.</p>
      <p>FTX had already filed for bankruptcy when that story broke but Bankman-Fried was subsequently arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the US to face eight counts of fraud.</p>

      <p>China is the world's No. 2 economy and home to dozens of companies that trade in the U.S. Right now, Pinduoduo parent PDD Holdings PDD, Canadian Solar CSIQ, BYD BYDDF, Tencent Holdings TCEHY and Baidu BIDU are China stocks worth watching or potentially buying.</p>
      <p>It's been a tough couple of years for Chinese stocks. The Covid pandemic, and Beijing's zero-Covid policy, have slammed the economy. Meanwhile, regulatory crackdowns vs. technology and data-centric firms such as Alibaba, Tencent TCEHY and NetEase NTES have been a major headwind. The tech crackdown seems to have eased.</p>
      <p>U.S. tensions are a concern. In recent months, the White House has barred shipments of key chip technology to China, adding to tariffs and other curbs on Chinese goods. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China has rolled back Covid restrictions significantly. With an end to lockdowns and other severe controls, a massive wave of infections took hold. But investors are looking beyond to brighter days ahead. With China New Year holidays out of the way, will the Chinese economy finally rebound?</p>
      <p>While the current top China stocks to buy or watch are dominated by e-commerce plays, don't forget EV startups such as Nio (NIO) and Li Auto (LI). Like global giant BYD (BYDDF), all are taking on Tesla (TSLA) in the world's largest EV market.</p>
      <h3>Tencent Stock</h3>
      <p>Tencent is China's messaging and gaming giant, with major payments exposure and with key holdings in an array of Chinese companies, including JD.com.</p>
      <p>Earnings have declined for the past four quarters, and revenue for the past two, as a big crackdown on internet platforms and new mobile games took a toll. Earnings growth is expected to return in 2023.</p>
      <p>JD.com stock peaked at 94.46 in February 2021, tumbling to a five-year low of 23.52 on Oct. 24, 2022. Since then shares have doubled, vaulting above moving averages</p>
      <p>Shares hit 52.88 on Jan. 27 and have pulled back. TECHY stock has fallen below its 50-day line.</p>
      <p>Ideally, Tencent would forge a new base after its big run.</p>
      <p>Tencent stock is listed in Hong Kong and trades over the counter in the U.S.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 8.86% in the week from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17, trading at US$23,764  at 7 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether strengthened 7.86% in the same period to change hands at US$1,665.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ncx-blog-24-1.webp" alt="ncx-blog"/>
      <p>Bitcoin saw this week’s second-biggest gains among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, followed by Polygon’s Matic that rose 13.33% to US$1.44.</p>
      <p>“I am expecting a slightly sideways move. The market has to calm a little before any further impulses,” wrote Aziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange GammaX, in a LinkedIn response to Forkast.</p>
      <p>“There is massive support and a strong buy orders wall which might push Bitcoin further towards US$29,000-30,000 in early March. However, there also is a strong support zone at US$22,250. If that support withholds, we might see another impulse toward US$25,300,” wrote Kenjaev, adding that “there will be more speculations over the SEC and Paxos, so keep your newsfeed open.”</p>
      <p>Kenjaev sees less correlation between traditional and crypto markets, as prices are mainly driven by industry developments.</p>
      <p>“The cryptocurrency market is more focused on developments inside its own ecosystem and the connectivity of this decentralized ecosystem to the centralized one. Hence, every development related to the regulators vs crypto companies, especially U.S. regulators, does and will affect the crypto market,” wrote Kenjaev.</p>
      <p>“Be mindful of the release, testing, deployment and adoption of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The major macroeconomic data I would like to see is the national debt. There has been a lot of money spent in recent years and governments will be looking to recover it,” wrote Kanjaev, adding that “the government knows that there is a good portion of funds floating in Web3.”</p>
      <p>The global crypto market cap stood at US$1.09 trillion on Friday at 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 6.86% from US$1.02 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$458 billion market cap represented 42.2% of the market, while Ether accounted for 18.7%.</p>
      <h3>Biggest Gainers</h3>
      <p>Astar Network’s Astr token was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Astar Network is a multi-chain smart contract network focused on Web3 innovation.</p>
      <p>Astr rallied 51.72% this past week to change hands at US$0.1099 after the announcement of its partnership with Sony to launch a Web3 incubation program to support developers building Web3 projects.</p>
      <p>Decentralized gaming developer’s Magic token was the second biggest gainer, up 44.94% to trade at US$2.18. The token started its rally on Feb. 13, after the company launched a new Game Builders Program supported by Arbitrum to incentivize high-potential games building on Treasure, by offering developers access to open-source code as well as advisory and marketing support.</p>
      <h3>Next Week</h3>
      <p>For the first time in Bitcoin’s history, a “death cross” appeared on its weekly chart. This meant that the 50-week small moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator, stood below the 200-week SMA for the first time.</p>
      <p>Kasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, said that the death cross “gives very little input,” since it only shows that Bitcoin price performed better in the last 50 weeks compared to the last 200 weeks.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin prices charted another significant formation, with its first “golden cross” on the daily timeframe since the beginning of the crypto bear market in November 2021. A golden cross means that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA. Historically, Bitcoin has charted multiple golden crosses in previous cycles before a sustained rally.</p>
      <p>“A record high 66.9% of circulating BTC has not moved in over a year,” tweeted Joe Burnett, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, adding that “Bitcoin bear markets end when there are no sellers remaining, the price slowly starts drifting up due to (any) marginal buyer, and the next wave of adopters learn BTC is the least uncertain money.”</p>
      <p>According to Kenjaev, this suggests that Bitcoin holders were more conservative. “They are waiting for the right time to sell and are hedging over the upcoming recession. The state of the global economic conditions now leads to more uncertainty than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The reason why the situation is not changing with current global developments is that investors do not see the same scenario happening. Current market conditions look risk-attractive and favorable, although it’s very early to call it the next bull run. We shall at the very least wait for improvements from regulatory bodies globally.”</p>
      <p>“Some patterns suggest that an ideal scenario for Bitcoin would be to drop near US$19,500-19,300,” he added, hoping for “a decline to US$19,500 and a jump to US$30,000.”</p>
      <p>On Feb. 12, Blockstream chief executive officer Adam Back predicted that Bitcoin would exceed US$200 million in market cap, bringing BTC prices to US$10 million by 2032.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin and Ether rebounded in Thursday morning trading in Asia amid broad gains in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies after a bout of profit-taking and mixed economic indicators sent prices lower on Wednesday. Solana, Polygon and Cardano led gains among the top 10 by market capitalization. U.S. equities were mixed overnight. Tesla beat earnings forecasts but the poor outlook from Microsoft on Wednesday and an interest rate hike expected next week kept a lid on trading.</p>
      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin rose 2% to US$23,096 in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen 11.66% in the seven days to date and resumed a strong run up since the start of the year after hitting a speed bump on Wednesday. Ether added 3.43% to US$1,610, up 6.36% in the same week, according to CoinMarketCap data.</li>
        <li>Solana jumped 7.78% to US$24.56 to post a week-to-date growth of 17.9%. Solana recently opened pre-orders for its blockchain-focused mobile phone Solana Saga, which is expected to launch as early as Q1 this year.</li>
        <li>Polygon added 3.85% to US$0.99 after the Fractal NFT gaming site on Wednesday said it was expanding onto the Polygon network. Cardano rose by 3.91% to US$0.37.</li>
        <li>The total crypto market capitalization grew 2.72% to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume saw a 12% increase to US$61.86 billion.</li>
        <li>U.S. equity markets had a mixed day on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both dipped almost 0.2%.</li>
        <li>More economic indicators are out on Thursday in the U.S., including GDP, durable goods orders and jobless claims, which could provide direction to equities through the end of the week.</li>
        <li>Members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are in a so-called blackout period before they meet next week – Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 – to decide the next move on interest rates. Analysts from CME Group predict a 99.8% chance of an increase of 25 basis points.</li>
        <li>Last month, the Fed raised interest rates by 50-basis points to between 4.25% and 4.5%, the highest in 15 years, to try and slow the pace of inflation and a number of indicators suggest that slowdown is happening. However, some investors remain concerned about the U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, tipping into a recession.</li>

      <p>By Stephen Culp</p>
      <p>NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced in choppy trading on Thursday as investors grappled with an onslaught of economic data and a string of mixed corporate earnings, all while eyeing the clock as it ticks down toward next week's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.</p>
      <p>While all three major U.S. stock indexes were green, megacap momentum stocks, buoyed by Tesla Inc's earnings beat and upbeat sales forecast, helped put the Nasdaq in the lead.</p>
      <p>A raft of data showed the U.S. economy fared better in the fourth quarter than analysts expected, and the labor market remains tight, despite some signs of weakening demand. This is a double-edged sword for investors, as it could embolden the Fed to keep key interest rates at restrictive levels for longer.</p>
      <p>While financial markets have largely priced in a 25 basis point rate from the central bank next Wednesday, that sentiment is not unanimous.</p>
      <p>The data "suggests a 50-basis-point rate hike next week and 25 basis points in March, and then possibly an end to the tightening cycle," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "I think the Fed wants to make sure that the markets don’t get ahead of themselves."</p>
      <p>"(The Fed tightening) hasn't worked its way through the system, but you’re beginning to see cracks in consumption and inflation," Cardillo added. "I'm sure the Fed is going to take note of that."</p>
      <p>Fourth-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with more than one fourth of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 69% have beaten consensus estimates, up from 67% on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Analysts now see aggregate fourth quarter earnings falling 2.7%, worse than the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1, but an improvement over the 3% annual decline as of Wednesday, per Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.4 points, or 0.26%, to 33,831.24, the S&P 500 gained 24 points, or 0.60%, to 4,040.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 122.49 points, or 1.08%, to 11,435.85.</p>
      <p>Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy led the percentage gainers, boosted by rising crude prices due to signs of increasing demand from China.</p>
      <p>Tesla Inc provided the most upside muscle to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, its shares jumping 9.4% in the wake of its earnings report.</p>
      <p>Chevron Corp announced it would triple its budget for share buybacks, which sent the oil major's stock up 4.4%.</p>
      <p>Among losers, IBM Corp fell 4.3% in the wake of its announcement that it would cut jobs divest some assets after falling short of its annual cash target.</p>
      <p>Southwest Airlines Co slid 4.0% after warning of current quarter losses.</p>
      <p>And despite forecasts of strong demand for air travel in 2023, the broader S&P 1500 Airlines index was off 1.6%.</p>
      <p>That might have something to do with Mastercard Inc's disappointing current quarter revenue forecast, cited an expected diminishing pent-up travel demand. The consumer payments company's shares were down 1.7%.</p>
      <p>Mastercard rival Visa Inc is due to post results after the bell, as is chip bellwether Intel Corp.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 89 new highs and 26 new lows (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Johann M Cherian and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)</p>

      <p>BNB could oscillate in a range in the next few hours/days.</p>
      <p>Short-term holders saw a sharp decline in profits after Tuesday’s sudden drop.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin [BTC] dropped from $23k to below $22.5k on Tuesday, pulling the altcoin market into a short-term plunge. Binance Coin [BNB] declined by 9% in the same period, dropping from $323 to $293. </p>
      <p>However, bulls found steady support of around $297 and launched a price recovery. At press time, BNB’s value was $303.6o and could oscillate in the range below for the next few hours/days. </p>
      <h3>BNB remained steady at the $300 – $310 range</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>On the three-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded from the 40 level and showed that buying pressure increased after dropping to the 40-mark.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was rejected at the zero mark, forcing it into an uptick on the positive side, which indicated that the BNB market was strengthening.</p>
      <p>Therefore, BNB could oscillate between the demand zone ($293 – $300) and $310 in the next couple of hours. BNB has traded within this range since 21 January, only to witness a false breakout on 24 January. A retest of the $319 could also be likely if BTC reclaims the $23k zone.</p>
      <p>However, BNB could drop below the demand zone if BTC breaks below $22.5k, invalidating the bias described above. But such a drop could settle on the 100-period EMA (exponential moving average) or $286.9 level.</p>
      <p>Swing traders should therefore track RSI rejection at the 50-mark, CMF crossover, and BTC price action to minimize risk exposure.</p>
      <h3>Short-term holders’ profits tanked and sentiment flipped into negative</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/bnb_steady2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>According to Santiment, BNB’s 30-day MVRV (market value to realized value) dropped from 36% to 6% at press time. Short-term holders’ profit tanked by 30% as BNB’s price correction wiped out recent gains.</p>
      <p>The price decline was also followed by an elevated negative weighted sentiment and a drop in demand in the derivatives market, as evidenced by the drop in the Funding Rate. However, the Funding Rate rested on the neutral line and any increment could boost BNB’s recovery.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, a further drop in the Funding Rate could set BNB to retest the demand zone below $300. Moreover, the active address in the past 24 hours also dropped, but there was a slight uptick at press time. Any further increase in active addresses could boost the recovery momentum.</p>

      <p>The S&P 500 metric showed a price correction while Ethereum continued an uptrend.</p>
      <p>Percent Supply in Profit was over 67% at press time, representing a four-month high for Ethereum.</p>
      <p>The price of Ethereum [ETH] rose dramatically over the last few days, which indicated a bull trend. Consequently, the recent activity of the S&P 500 metric and its correlation with crypto may provide some indication as to the same.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum and equity prices go in opposite directions</h3>
      <p>Recent information indicated that Ethereum’s price was trending opposite to the S&P 500. Per Santiment’s data, at press time, the price of the S&P 500 index underwent a correction following its previous rising trajectory.</p>
      <p>When the S&P 500 (a proxy for equities) and cryptocurrency show no relationship to one another, a bull market is said to have begun.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) measures the collective stock market performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded corporations in the United States. The index components are chosen by Standard & Poor’s, an S & P Global division, and broadly represent the U.S. stock market.</p>
      <h3>Percent Supply in Profit hits four-month high</h3>
      <p>Besides the stock market’s movement, the percentage of supply in profit is a leading sign of an Ethereum bull run. Over 67% of the Percent Supply was profitable, as evidenced by data from Glassnode.</p>
      <p>The graph also showed that the present level of the Percent Supply in profit was at its highest in four months. The significance of this statistic in evaluating the Ethereum bull run is that the greater the Percent Supply in profit, the more likely a bull run is in play.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <h3>MVRV shows reduced loss</h3>
      <p>When the 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is included, the case for a bull market becomes stronger. The MVRV ratio was roughly 6.3% at the time of writing. The current MVRV level indicated a 6% decrease in the value of Ethereum.</p>
      <p>Though a loss, the stretch to recoup the earlier loss suggested a bull market. However, it would be a complete run when it turned the holdings in the 365-day period into profit.</p>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/ethereum_metrics-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <h3>Ethereum remains in the overbought zone</h3>
      <p>A daily timeframe chart of Ethereum’s price showed that it was trading near $1,550 as of this writing. The current price region represented a gain of nearly 30% at press time, as calculated using the Price Range tool.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings indicated that the price was relatively stable in the overbought territory.</p>

      <p>This article is the first in what I hope will be a regular weekend series. A variety of technical analysis techniques will be used to look at probable moves for the S&P 500 (SPY) in the week ahead. No personal bias will be shown and no predictions will be made either. Rather, the market will be viewed in probable outcomes using inflection points - if it is going down, where is it likely to go? If it is going up, where is it likely to test? Likewise, if it breaks a key level to the downside, what does that tell us about the market and where is it likely to go?</p>
      <p>The technical analysis itself will be kept fairly simple. After all, one line drawn from the early 2022 top and through the peaks has been the main technical barrier all last year and continues to be important. Tried and tested techniques such as classic patterns, trendlines, major moving averages and horizontal support form the body of the analysis. Demark systems are also used to detect exhaustion and volume profile shows additional areas of interest.</p>
      <p>The S&P 500 chart will be analyzed on monthly, weekly and daily timeframes, then the information collated into an actionable summary at the end.</p>
      <h3>The Market Narrative</h3>
      <p>While the focus of this article is primarily on technical analysis, a more complete picture combines it with fundamental and sentiment studies.</p>
      <p>Last week saw the sixth consecutive drop in inflation and there is now plenty evidence it should continue to fall. The Fed won this particular battle. However, the labor market, and particularly wage growth, remain a risk to any further shift away from the hawkish stance. For now, the message from the Fed is that rates will stay high for an extended period.</p>
      <p>But is this warning just a bluff to keep markets from getting too bullish too quickly? The market seems to think so - the expectation is that the Fed are going to slow the pace of hikes to a halt over the coming months and then start cutting in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>The question next week and beyond is whether this situation merits the bullish breakout brewing on the charts. Sentiment has improved drastically in recent months and is reflected already in today's price. A Fed pivot has been a primary driver for months. What is left to continue the rally? Easing in the labor market and confirmed dovish signals from the Fed would complete the bullish narrative, but neither are going to happen next week. Personally, I wouldn't trust the rally until a weekly close above 4050.</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Monthly</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-1.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The monthly chart shows the SPX trading inside the range set in December. Resistance is at the range high of 4101 and beyond that, 4325 at the high of August. Support is at December's low of 3764 and the 3491 low.</p>
      <p>There are no exhaustion signals in either direction (using Demark methods).</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Weekly</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-2.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>Last week's bar closed near the highs. This gives an upside bias into early next week to at least take out last week's 4003 high.</p>
      <p>Resistance comes in at 4048.5 at the 50ma, which will drop to around 4045 next week. There is also trendline resistance (or the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern) near the same level at 4040. If this area is broken, 4101 is the next resistance, then 4203 at the large weekly gap. Support is at the 3764 pivot low and the 200ma at 3680.</p>
      <p>Again, there are no exhaustion signals in either direction.</p>
      <p>The trend is down (lower lows and lower highs).</p>
      <h3>S&P 500 Daily</h3>
      <img src="https://ncx.cx/images/s&p-3.png" alt="Ethereum_metrics"/>
      <p>The daily chart is at a very important juncture. Friday's session closed at 3999 which was above the 200dma at 3981 and above the trendline at the same level.</p>
      <p>Resistance has been cleared and now only comes from higher timeframe references. Initial support is at 3928 and the gap, then last Tuesday's low of 3877.</p>
      <p>There are no exhaustion signals but a sell set up is now on bar 6. This could become active on Tuesday and Wednesday (bars 8 and 9) and suggests a pause/pullback could materialize.</p>
      <p>The trend is neutral/up. Price is above all major MAs and the bearish trendline.</p>
      <h3>Scenarios for Next Week</h3>
      <strong>Bullish</strong>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, there is a bullish bias due to the strong weekly close and the close above the daily 200ma and trendline. A test of weekly resistance at 4040-45 therefore looks likely. If this breaks, it should bring the monthly resistance of 4101 into play, with 4203 a stretched target above that.</p>
      <strong>Bearish</strong>
      <p>Exhaustion signals could trigger on Tuesday/Wednesday should there be a rally early in the week. Failure to break 4040-45 could flip the view bearish/neutral if it leads to a drop back under 3975-80 and the 200dma/trendline which is declining by around 3 points a day. Daily references of 3928 and 3877 could then be tested, with 3764 good weekly support and unlikely to be broken.</p>
      <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      <p>The S&P 500 is testing very important technical resistance and looks to be making a bullish breakout following the positive CPI report last week. One thing to note is that this is a rather obvious and closely watched move and it still needs to clear weekly resistance at 4040-45 and hold its gains to cement a bullish look.</p>

      <p>One of last year’s top-performing equity exchange-traded funds, the VanEck Steel ETF (SLX), stealthily outperformed broader markets. After 2022’s 14% gain, investors may wonder, can it do so again?</p>
      <p>The ETF is the only one covering steel specifically, investing in global steel producers. It manages $101.3 million in assets, only one-fourth of what it managed in 2008. Still, SLX is about the only way to access the performance of steel directly.</p>
      <p>Those outflows may seem surprising. SLX has performed well in in previous years, with three-and five-year annualized returns of 21.2% and 10.2%, respectively. Still, it’s lost nearly $19 million last year despite its positive performance and its indirect exposure to a key global commodity.</p>
      <p>Although nearly half of the portfolio is invested in U.S. equities, the fund also offers exposure to countries like Brazil (19.4%), the U.K. (10.7%) and Italy (5.6%). Top holdings include Rio Tinto plc (12.4%), Vale, S.A. (12.1%) and Nucor Corp. (6.8%).</p>
      <p>SLX’s liquidity isn’t great, with FactSet rating it at the lowest end of its scale, but SLX’s volumes and spreads are within the normal range relative to other similarly sized equity funds. It’s also not likely to close given it has more than $100 million in assets and has been trading for more than 14 years. Its 0.55% expense ratio is at the low end for a specialty equity ETF.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that SLX has a dividend yield for the past 12 months of 4.26% versus 1.65% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).</p>
      <h3>What’s Ahead for Steel</h3>
      <p>Steel price gains may be fairly muted this year after having been driven up by supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war, but nothing too extreme in either direction, according to Christos Rigoutsos, a senior economist with S&P Global.</p>
      <p>“It's not a matter of weakness in pricing—it's the fact that prices will tend [toward] normal rather than actually being weak or lower than that,” he told ETF.com, pointing out that steel prices over the past year have been “sky high” and that the situation is simply normalizing.</p>
      <p>He notes that steel producers will idle production when surpluses of the commodity build up. Add that to the fact that prices are already only slightly above cost, there’s not much downside, according to Rigoutsos. However, he also emphasizes steel is not recession-proof, as manufacturing tends to fall off in that kind of environment.</p>
      <p>Given all that, there may be some upside remaining for SLX, while a similar level of outperformance is unlikely to continue very far into 2023. However, its specific focus and global nature could provide additional diversification to a portfolio with little added risk.</p>
      <p>With recession fears high, a fund focused on companies producing a crucial commodity could be seen as an attractive prospect.</p>

      <p>Solana was on track to bring some developments to its network.</p>
      <p>SOL’s TVL and price suffered a decline while NFT trades ran smoothly.</p>
      <p>Solana [SOL] has been locked in FUD for a long time, affecting its price drastically. However, the network had some positives to show as its development continued.</p>
      <p>After rumors surfaced linking the Solana ecosystem to the troubled FTX and SBF debacle, SOL came under close examination. The FTX incident left a lasting impression on the network, and the corresponding FUD was difficult to dispel.</p>
      <p>It appeared, however, that Solana had not let up on the gas in its pursuit to prove its worth. Given current statistics, how well has this worked out?</p>
      <h3>Upcoming updates</h3>
      <p>The Firedancer is an upcoming improvement scheduled for rollout on Solana to bolster the reliability of its network. Formed by Jump Crypto, Firedancer is a decentralized validator client written in C++.</p>
      <p>After going live, Solana will join Ethereum as the second multi-client chain. The likelihood that a flaw may cause severe damage to the network is reduced when numerous sets of code exist that can “run” the chain from scratch. </p>
      <p>Additionally, in the event of a flawed implementation, the network gains from a second, unrelated implementation are less likely to suffer from the same flaws simultaneously. Similarly, Firedancer will be released in 2020 and can provide significant performance boosts.</p>
      <h3>Dev activity resumes an upward trend</h3>
      <p>There was some relief after Solana suffered from a noticeable decline. Development on Solana was steadily picking up, according to the Development Activity statistic at press time. Dev activity, according to the metric, was approximately 20.2.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-SOL-13.33.27-16-Dec-2022.png" alt="santiment" />
      <h3>Active developers reduce on Solana and other blockchains</h3>
      <p>Data from the Token Terminal also showed a decline in developers working on well-known blockchains. Because of the decrease in Solana’s developers from over 2,000 to 75, the number of active developers in the general crypto space fell from 3,700 to roughly 1,600.</p>
      <p>This would imply that the drop in Solana affected the crypto industry.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-active-developers.png" alt="token-terminal" />
      <h3>Price and TVL face sharp decline</h3>
      <p>In recent weeks, SOL’s price has been stagnant at best. It was trading at roughly $13 at the time of this writing, a sharp decline from its $30 price at the start of November 2022.</p>
      <p>The Price Range statistic revealed that Solana lost 60% of its value since the last time it was in the $30 range. The low volume, devoid of any significant spikes – indicated by the volume indicator – showed that the asset had not been traded actively in recent weeks.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SOLUSD_2022-12-16_13-33-39.png" alt="Tradingview" />
      <p>A review of Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also revealed that it had drastically decreased in value. The TVL observed was still over $1 billion as of October.</p>
      <p>However, it was discovered that the current worth was around $280 million. The TVL showed a severe decline to which the FTX event and the current market trend contributed.</p>
      <h3>NFT trade remains active</h3>
      <p>The NFT measures provided some promise despite the negative trends shown in the SOL price and Solana’s TVL. Solana was still active, as indicated by the Total NFT trade Volume statistic, expressed in USD. The statistic revealed that NFT sales on the network had sales of over $1.4 million on 6 December alone.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Solana-SOL-13.33.20-16-Dec-2022.png" alt="santiment" />
      <p>Additionally, Helium will switch to the Solana network in the first quarter of 2023, according to the Helium Foundation. This is despite the present difficulties of the Solana network. The network hasn’t ceased developing despite its challenges; therefore, it might endure and emerge from the FTX fallout.</p>

      <p>Around 13% of the American population — or 43 million people — have held cryptocurrency at some point in their lives, new research from JPMorgan Chase has revealed.</p>
      <p>According to a Dec. 13 report titled "The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use,” this number has risen dramatically since before 2020, when the figure was only around 3%.</p>
      <p>The latest data from JPMorgan comes from analyzing checking account transfers from a sample of over 5 million customers. It found that 600,000 customers in this sample group transferred cash to crypto accounts at some point during period from 2020 to 2022.</p>
      <p>The study also noted that cryptocurrency holders typically made their first crypto purchases during spikes in crypto prices. During this time, the amount of cash being sent into crypto exchange accounts typically far outweigh the cash being removed. In other words, most people were holding onto their crypto during this time period.</p>
      <p>This changed in early 2022 as crypto prices fell, according to JPMorgan. In recent months, cash transfers into crypto exchanges have only slightly exceeded cash transfers out of them.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan says that this is a result of both price declines in crypto and a broader trend of the savings rate declining in the United States since the pandemic:</p>
      <p>“We view the rise and fall of crypto use since the onset of COVID as consistent with the joint relationship between retail flows and market prices seen in prior research. Additionally, the trend in crypto flows also tracks dynamics of household savings, which spiked to historic highs early in the pandemic but has begun to reverse.”</p>
      <h3>Who's buying?</h3>
      <p>The report also weighed in on whether certain demographic groups are more likely to buy crypto. It found that men of all ages buy significantly more crypto than women, and that younger people buy significantly more than older people. For example, the report found that over 25% of millennial men have bought crypto, whereas only around 12% of millennial women and 5% of male baby boomers have.</p>

      <p>he research also found that crypto holdings were relatively minor for most individuals, with median flows equal to less than one week’s worth of take-home pay. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, about 15% of crypto owners had more than a month’s pay invested in crypto</p>
      <p><strong> Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin has bottomed as “everyone who could go bankrupt has gone bankrupt”</strong></p>
      <p>The crypto market has gone through a dramatic fall in 2022. Bitcoin has fallen from a 2022 high of $47,459 in March to $17,208 at the time of writing, while Ether has fallen from $3,521 in April to $1,273 at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>This fall in the crypto market has been the result of market shocks such as TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin losing its peg in May and crypto exchange FTX going bankrupt in November.</p>
      <p>Trading fees have fallen on many crypto exchanges, and Coinbase has even stated that its revenue has fallen by nearly 50%.</p>
      <p>But despite this decline in crypto prices and trading activity, this new report indicates that crypto ownership has still increased over the course of the last few years.</p>

      <p>A tweet by the blockchain intelligence firm, Santiment in the past day shows that several altcoins have seen “big upticks in address activity and dormant wallets awakening to move their funds.” The tweet read: “Others [altcoins] are staying stuck in the mud and are more likely to fall behind.”</p>
      <p>Santiment focused on three altcoins in its latest report such as Uniswap (UNI), Ren (REN), and yearn.finance (YFI).</p>
      <p>One example of an altcoin that has seen its network activity increase quite impressively after a consolidation period is YFI, according to the blockchain intelligence firm.</p>
      <p></p>
      <img src="https://coinedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SANTIMENT-1920x650.png" alt="Spike in Network Activity" />
      <p>Meanwhile, the report showed that network activity for REN did not pick up as much as YFI because of the project’s “complicated financial situation.”</p>
      <p>Lastly, UNI experienced strong growth before when the project announced its NFT marketplace. Network activity for UNI has continued to grow, even compared with the NFT-related pump, according to the report.</p>
      <p>At press time, YFI is trading at $6,257.01 following a 2.63% drop in price over the last 24 hours. This is according to the crypto market tracking website, CoinMarketCap. The altcoin’s price has also weakened against Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by 0.80% and 0.98%, respectively.</p>
      <p>REN on the other hand, is up 2.88% over the last 24 hours. In addition to strengthening against the U.S. dollar, REN’s price has become resilient against BTC and ETH by 4.80% and 4.61%, respectively.</p>
      <p>UNI is also currently down 1.52%, but, it strengthened against Bitcoin by 0.44% and also strengthened against ETH by 0.24% over the same time period.</p>

      <p>The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. launched two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking cryptocurrency futures on Friday, becoming the first “in Asia to offer crypto asset exposure through ETFs,” the exchange said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s virtual asset licensing regime to take effect next June</p>
      <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The two ETFs — CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ether Futures ETF — respectively track the Bitcoin futures contracts and Ether futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and are both managed by CSOP Asset Management Ltd., a Hong Kong unit of Chinese state-backed asset manager China Southern Asset Management Co. Ltd.</li>
        <li>The two attracted a combined US$73.6 million in investment ahead of their Friday debut, CSOP said in a Thursday statement.</li>
        <li>“They provide investors with exposure to the digital asset space for the first time in Asia and reflect both our ongoing commitment to, and the market’s appetite for, the digital economy,” Wilfred Yiu, chief operating officer and co-head of markets of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, or HKEX, said in a Friday statetment.</li>
        <li>The city’s first crypto-linked ETFs come after Hong Kong in October said it would work to regain its role as a cryptocurrency hub in Asia. Financial Secretary Paul Chan last month doubled down on the government’s position despite the collapse of the FTX.com exchange.</li>
        <li>Last week, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed an amendment to the bill that includes a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers, which will come into effect on June 1, 2023.</li>

      <p>Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party approved a proposal on Thursday that exempts companies issuing cryptocurrencies from taxes on unrealized capital gains for tokens they retain on their books, Bloomberg reported, citing party member Akihisa Shiozaki.</p>

        <li>The proposal reviewed by the ruling party’s tax committee aims to improve business conditions for companies issuing cryptocurrencies,Shiozaki told Bloomberg.</li>
        <li>Currently, Japan imposes a levy of around 30% on companies sitting on unrealized gains from cryptocurrency holdings.</li>

      <p>PayPal PYPL joined forces with ConsenSys in a bid to expand its offerings in the booming cryptocurrency space and expand its customer reach.</p>
      <p>Per the terms, PayPal has been added as an option for cryptocurrency transactions to ConsenSys’ MetaMask, which is a digital cryptocurrency wallet.</p>
      <p>Notably, users of MetaMask will now be able to buy and transfer the second-most-popular cryptocurrency called Ether seamlessly by just tapping the “buy” button and logging into their PayPal accounts.</p>
      <p>The underlined integration will aid MetaMask in expanding its reach to customers using Web3 applications like play-to-earn games and metaverse applications, among others.</p>
      <p>Similarly, PayPal will also be able to gain traction among Web3 application users, whose number is rising rapidly.</p>
      <p>Currently, the PayPal option within MetaMask is available to selected U.S. users. The feature will be rolled out eventually across the United States.</p>

      <p>PayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. Quote</p>
      <h3>Growing Crypto Efforts</h3>
      <p>The latest move bodes well for the company’s strengthening crypto initiatives.</p>
      <p>Apart from the latest move, PayPal offers a feature called crypto on Venmo, which lets Venmo customers buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly within the Venmo app. Customers can also check cryptocurrency trends from the app. </p>
      <p>Further, the company offers its cryptocurrency service in the United Kingdom, which allows users to buy, hold and sell digital currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin directly from their PayPal accounts.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s acquisition of a digital asset security technology provider — Curv — remains noteworthy.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of a feature called Checkout with Crypto, which allows customers to seamlessly convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency at the checkout, is another positive.</p>
      <p>With all these endeavors, PayPal remains well-poised to penetrate the booming cryptocurrency market rapidly amid the pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of digital currency transactions.</p>
      <p>Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.2% between 2022 and 2030.</p>
      <h3>Competitive Scenario</h3>
      <p>We note that the latest move, along with the above-mentioned efforts, is likely to strengthen PayPal’s competitive position against one of its biggest peers, Block SQ.</p>
      <p>Block facilitates the buying and selling of bitcoins via its Cash App. It also intends to develop a bitcoin mining system, with the help of which it strives to carry out the processes of mining, maintaining, setting up and purchasing bitcoin efficiently.</p>
      <p>Apart from Square, Shopify SHOP is also leaving no stone unturned to gain a strong foothold in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
      <p>Shopify allows its merchants to accept payments in bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies. It recently took a step further in the crypto market by making its platform NFT-enabled, which allows users to mint and trade collectibles.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, PayPal’s strong crypto initiatives and the growing crypto volume are likely to strengthen its position in the intensifying cryptocurrency battle against the above-mentioned companies.</p>
      <h3>Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider</h3>
      <p>Currently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p>
      <p>Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector can consider a better-ranked stock like Arista Networks ANET, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
      <p>Arista Networks has lost 8.9% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ANET is currently projected at 17.5%.</p>

      <p>Avalanche recently announced the launch of the mobile version of its Core Wallet.</p>
      <p>Avalanche’s latest developments have caused AVAX to rally by over 5% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Avalanche has recently started rolling out new features and forming new alliances to impact the ecosystem. Owners of AVAX have been forced to grasp onto hope despite these actions because the effects have been minimal if any at all. However, the most recent developments revealed by the ecosystem may attract new users and impact AVAX.</p>
      <h3>Mobile core wallet</h3>
      <p>On 13 December, Avalanche announced the release of its Core Wallet app for mobile devices. In its initial release in June of this year, the Core wallet had native Avalanche bridging capabilities, allowing users to connect with dApps on the Avalanche network.</p>
      <p>In the past, users who wished to transfer their assets to the network had to resort to third-party tools like MetaMask, which offered a similar Ethereum-Avalanche bridge.</p>
      <p>Avalanche’s latest change could pave the way for the company to attract more consumers. This has the potential to boost both ecosystem participation and user count.</p>
      <p>The network claimed that the Core wallet’s other distinctive features included the ability to trade Avalanche, Bitcoin easily, and Ethereum assets. Also, the transfer of Bitcoin and Ethereum to participate in Avalanche DeFi dApps, and track real-time asset price movements in a unified watchlist. </p>
      <h3>Avalanche’s recent partnership</h3>
      <p>Avalanche has also recently launched a learn-and-earn program in collaboration with Robinhood. By incorporating Robinhood’s “learn and earn” feature, the ecosystem would be able to onboard a wider variety of users.</p>
      <p>In related news, Avalanche had also recently established a relationship with Alibaba Cloud. As a result of the collaboration, the platform would be offering Node-as-a-Service. This service would allow any operator interested in running a node to do so by simply connecting to an already-built architecture without a complex set-up.</p>
      <h3>AVAX in daily timeframe</h3>
      <p>By taking a glance at AVAX in a daily timeframe, it was possible to see more clearly how these feature enhancements and partnerships are yet to have the expected impact.</p>
      <p>The asset’s price movement trend was underwhelming when examined. But it was clear that it had increased by more than 5% over the preceding trading period.</p>
      <p>This would imply a favorable reaction to the network’s most recent news. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading with less than a 1% increase in value, and it appeared to be rising.</p>

      <p>While actuarial tables and claims adjustments sound boring, market-beating returns are always a good time.</p>
      <p>This year, the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK) has been one of the few stock exchange-traded funds outside of energy that handily topped broader markets like the S&P 500.</p>
      <p>The fund is up about 12% and recently hit its all-time high. It did this in one of the worst equity market environments in years, and without exposure to energy stocks. Energy is the only major sector with positive returns year to date, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has dropped 16%.</p>
      <p>Three ETFs trading on U.S. exchanges provide exposure to insurance stocks. With 58 holdings, IAK is the broadest that covers this category in addition to being the top performer year to date. With $558 million in assets under management, it’s also the largest compared with the $525 million SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the $347 million Invesco KBW Property & Casualty Insurance ETF (KBWP). Those two funds are up 4.3% and 11.2%, respectively.</p>
      <p>All but one of IAK’s top 10 holdings—including names like Chubb Corp., Progressive Corp. and MetLife Inc.—have notched positive returns during 2022, the majority of them in the double digits. The top firms in the fund have mostly reported strong earnings and revenues this year, boosting their performance in a tough market, and spurring the ETFs gains.</p>
      <p>IAK is probably doing well for a number of reasons, one being that insurance companies do well in unstable economic times because as more or less steady companies, they aren’t affected by the downturn in the economy like other industries. They also provide essential services whose demand profile doesn’t fluctuate with economic cycles.</p>
      <p>Rising interest rates also boost insurance companies’ “float,” the pool of money, collected as premiums, which they invest conservatively and use to make claims payments. The Federal Reserve boosting rates from around zero to 4% Monday has helped IAK’s companies, and with more hikes expected this year and next, the insurance industry may be positioned well for strong profits for some time.</p>
      <p>So far this year, IAK has seen strong inflows, gaining $422.3 million year to date, while KBWP pulled in $248.5 million, and KIE—a broadly based insurance fund like IAK—gained just $62.8 million. With more room to run, those funds could pull in even more.</p>
      <h3>An Analyst’s View</h3>
      <p>The Deloitte Center for Financial Services’ report on its 2023 outlook the insurance industry in September 2022 noted that while insurers are “facing a host of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges,” they exhibited agility during the pandemic in terms of adopting remote work and adapting to customer needs.</p>
      <p>They should continue to maintain that momentum, Deloitte advises, by investing in technology and their workforce while focusing on innovation and their customers.</p>
      <p>The report also notes that ESG considerations will become increasingly important to stakeholders, and that those could be major differentiators in competing within the insurance peer group. The firm declined to comment further when contacted.</p>
      <p>Deloitte U.S. Insurance Leader Karl Hersch said in a video in its outlook that the sector is at a “post-pandemic inflection point” during which it could “reset the narrative” around it.</p>
      <p>While the report cites inflation as cutting into profitability, it notes several opportunities for growth. Those include small businesses, in particular when it comes to cybersecurity-related mishaps.</p>
      <p>The push toward green energy could result in $125 billion in spending on such matters projected by 2030. In the digital realm, including cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse, the report notes that only 17% of related assets are insured.</p>

      <p>Aave grew on the Arbitrum network but declined on Ethereum</p>
      <p>Arbitrum’s TVL witnessed growth, and the number of transactions on the protocol rose</p>
      <p>According to new data from Dune Analytics, Aave [AAVE] users on Arbitrum witnessed major growth. More and more users have increasingly switched to Arbitrum, indicating that L2 adoption was rapidly rising.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ARB-ETH.jpeg" alt="What does aave growth on arbitrum" />
      <p>Arbitrum is a major layer 2 solution that has been contributing to the growth of the sector. Its TVL grew tremendously over the last few weeks and sat at 1.08 billion at the time of writing after appreciating by 1.24% in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>However, despite the TVL growth, Arbitrum’s activity and TPS were unable to rise. The latter declined by 26.78%, according to data from L2beats.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hp-image.png" alt="defiLama"/>
      <p>Regardless of the momentary decline in Arbitrum’s TPS, the number of transactions on the protocol grew significantly since September. Even though there was volatility observed in the number of transactions, overall, the number of transactions kept moving in a positive direction.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the number of unique users on the L2 protocol increased from 1.7 million to 12.16 million in the last month, according to Arbiscan.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-11-at-1.28.31-PM.png" alt="arbiscran"/>
      <h3>State of Aave on Ethereum</h3>
      <p>The growing presence of Aave on Arbitrum had a correspondingly negative impact on Aave’s presence on the Ethereum [ETH] network.</p>
      <p>As can be seen from the image below, the volume for Aave on Ethereum decreased rapidly. Additionally, large addresses also lost interest in Aave. This was indicated by the declining top addresses holding AAVE on the network.</p>
      <p>Aave’s network growth decreased as well, thus, signifying that the number of new users transferring the coin for the first time on Ethereum’s network shrank.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether the growth of Aave on the Arbitrum network points to a larger shift to L2 networks.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, AAVE was trading at $61.52, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

      <p>Auditing firm Mazars has released 
      a report about Binance’s BTC reserves. The auditing firm has reached the same conclusion as Binance itself. As of November 
      22 at 23:59 UTC, Binance held enough bitcoins and wrapped bitcoins to cover all users’s balances on the exchange.</p>
      <p>Binance had already launched a proof-of-reserves website nearly two weeks ago to reassure its users following 
        the collapse of FTX. Today’s audit just confirms that Binance doesn’t appear to be lying, according to Mazars</p>
      <p>As always, there are some limitations with these proof-of-reserves exercises. The biggest caveat is that Binance 
          is only focusing on BTC assets for now. If you hold other cryptocurrencies, there is no proof-of-reserves system 
          just yet.</p>
      <p>While bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency, Binance offers hundreds of different crypto assets. So let’s 
        hope this is just a first step.</p>
      <p>Similarly, both Binance and Mazars looked at the BTC reserves on November 22 at 23:59 UTC. While it’s hard to provide 
        an instant snapshot, Binance hasn’t committed to a timeline for its proof-of-reserves reports. For instance, the crypto 
        exchange could share data every week or every month.</p>
      <p>Now that you are aware of all that, let’s talk about what’s in Binance’s proof-of-reserves system and the Mazars 
        auditing report. Binance uses a Merkle tree to include all individual user accounts and generate a cryptographic seal. 
        This Merkle tree covers user balances across several Binance products — Spot, Funding, Margin, Futures, Earn and Options 
        Wallet.</p>
      <p>Binance also listed all the wallets that hold customer assets. Blockchain explorers let you obtain the balance of 
        crypto wallets just by looking at the public addresses of those wallets.</p>
      <p>Binance found that its users collectively held 575,742.4228 BTC ($9.7 billion at today’s exchange rate) and that it 
        has enough BTC and wrapped BTC to cover 101% of these funds. It then contacted Mazars so the auditing firm could 
        independently verify what the crypto exchange was saying.</p>
      <p>Mazars asked Binance to perform tiny transactions at a specific time to show that the wallets were indeed under 
        the control of Binance. For some wallets, it used a different method. In that case, Mazars used Etherscan and BSCscan 
        to check that the ETH and BSC wallets belong to Binance.</p>
      <p>The auditing firm checked the scripts that Binance is using to extract the total value in user accounts. Mazars 
        checked that there wasn’t any duplication of user IDs and constructed its own Merkle tree using this open source 
        script developed by SilverSixpence.</p>
      <p>Some users have a negative BTC balance because they have been using the margin and loan service with other crypto 
        assets as collateral. “Binance’s margin and loan products are always over-collateralized and subject to additional 
        risk controls (such as auto liquidation). These products ONLY utilize funds from customers actively using Binance 
        Earn products such as savings whose terms permit this,” Binance said as a comment in the auditing report.</p>
      <p>If you take everything into account, Mazars and Binance reach the same conclusion when it comes to BTC reserves. 
        This is a good step when it comes to transparency. Now, let’s hope there will be more announcements in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, released a new report on Wednesday from global 
        financial audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showing that Binance's customer bitcoin  reserves are 
        overcollateralized.</p>
      <p>"At the time of assessment, Mazars observed Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total 
        platform liabilities," Mazars said in an announcement. 
        The exact percentage was 101%.</p>
      <p>The collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX because of liquidity issues has rivals rushing to improve the 
        transparency of their financial reserves. The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin 
        is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.</p>
      <p>However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting 
        at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. "They did a comparison of balances per public key address 
        from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or 
        depositories," said McKenna.</p>
      <p>"This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report," she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based 
        accounting firm that provided auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017 was accused of “serial 
        violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
        Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports in August.</p>
      <p>Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis. 
        Assets included were customers’ spot, options, margin, futures, funding, loan and earn accounts for BTC and wrapped 
        bitcoin held on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.</p>

      <p>With the recent events in the crypto space, investors seem to be putting more faith in DEXes</p>
      <p>DEXes has seen recently seen an increase in trading volume and TVL in recent time</p>
      <p>Investors have started viewing centralized exchanges (CEXes) with skepticism as fear and uncertainty have engulfed the cryptocurrency market. However, despite the current state of CEXes, their decentralized equivalent seems to be thriving. According to data by Messari, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have recently experienced a significant spike in volume. But how significant have these spikes been?</p>
      <h3>DEXes trade volume surge</h3>
      <p>Messari’s statistics revealed that the top three DEXes, Uniswap, Balancer, and Sushiswap had a combined transaction volume of nearly $7 billion over the previous 30 days. However, a closer look at each one showed how much growth had occurred.</p>
      <p>In terms of transaction volume and TVL, Uniswap was ranked first among all DEXes. The trading volume for Uniswap revealed that there had been noticeable rises in recent weeks. This demonstrates the platform’s increased trading activity.</p>
      <p>The trading volume for the DEX reached approximately $300 million, which was a record for the year so far, according to the trade volume chart.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-pink.png" alt="Dex sees inceases in trading volume"/>
      <p>It had experienced $3.57 billion in trade volume over the previous 30 days, a rise of 65.32%. Although the TVL showed a modest dip, it still had $2.6 billion, at the time of writing.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-down.png" alt="Dex sees inceases in trading volume"/>
      <p>In the previous 30 days, its revenue had likewise climbed by over 64%.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a glance at Balancer revealed that the DEX experienced a sharp increase in trade volume. Trading volume reached its all-time high during this time, rising by a staggering 730.38% in the past 30 days to reach $2.09 billion</p>
      <p>The overall revenue climbed by 40.68% and was $1.09 million during the same time frame. Also, TVL had grown by almost 600% and was worth $699 million, as of this writing. </p>
      <h3>Overall TVL sees an uptrend</h3>
      <p>It was also evident that there had been a rise in total TVL during November, according to DefiLlama data. From the statistics, it was clear that there had been a reduction in recent months. Starting from $57 billion in October, the TVL observed at the time of this writing was above $92 billion.</p>
      <img src="https://ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ao-tv-blue-up.png" alt="breakdown of crpto" />
      <p>The obvious increase in these DEXes’ trading volumes is evidence of how recently that area has come to receive a lot more attention. The increased interest could lead to a more balanced crypto economy and encourage participation outside of centralized exchanges.</p>
      <p>This is not meant to minimize or overlook the significance of centralized exchanges within the ecosystem; rather, DEXes provide investors with different options.</p>

      <p>Semiconductor exchange-traded funds surged after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed Monday it bought more than $4 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>ETFs including the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD), the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) gained more than 4% and were among the five biggest ETF movers on Tuesday. A handful of Taiwan and semiconductor funds rounded out the top 10 ETF movers.</p>
      <p>Berkshire’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing disclosed 4.12 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to Apple Inc., purchased in the third calendar quarter. Apple is the top holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.</p>
      <p>The company’s shares have been among the most beaten-down in what has been a declining tech market this year. Even with today’s more than 12% gain, TSMC—as it’s also known—has dropped 32% this year, more than the 27% decline in the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ).</p>
      <p>That decline may have been seen as a buying opportunity for Buffett, who, along with business partner Charlie Munger, are the world’s most famous value investors. Semiconductors are generally priced low at present: XSD’s price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times earnings falls beneath QQQ’s 22 times.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Berkshire purchases, geopolitical tensions in the region may have taken a breather after President Joe Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Indonesia Monday and committed to working together to solve economic and security issues.</p>
      <p>China has promised to reunify Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, which the U.S. opposes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s July trip to Taiwan in support of the country infuriated China and led the country to cut off some diplomatic channels with the U.S.</p>
